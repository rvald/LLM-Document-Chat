Purpose of the Final Rule \nMammography is an x-ray imaging \nexamination used to identify signs of \nbreast cancer. For patients to receive the full benefit of mammography, the \nservice must be of high quality, including performance of the examination by qualified technologists, using equipment that is tested and properly functioning; interpretation by qualified physicians; and clear and prompt communication of results to patients and their referring healthcare providers. The MQSA establishes uniform baseline Federal standards designed to ensure, among other things, that all patients nationwide have access to quality mammography services. The MQSA implementing regulations address, among other things, standards for accreditation bodies and certifying agencies and mammography quality standards for facilities, such as qualifications of personnel at mammography facilities, standards for mammography equipment, the content and terminology for mammography reports, the requirement to establish a quality assurance program, standards and timing for quality assurance testing, standards for clinical image quality, recordkeeping, communication of results, and clinical image review by the facility\u2019s accrediting body. Based on technology changes in mammography and our experience with the administration of the MQSA program, FDA is modernizing and updating the regulations as well as improving the information, including breast density information, provided by mammography facilities to patients and their healthcare providers. This final rule requires that the summary of the mammography report written in lay terms (\u2018\u2018lay summary\u2019\u2019) that is provided to patients identifies whether the patient has dense or non-dense breast tissue and includes a prescribed paragraph on the significance of breast density. The rule also establishes four categories for reporting breast tissue density in the mammography report that is provided to the patient\u2019s referring healthcare provider. \nB. Legal Authority \nThe MQSA was enacted on October \n27, 1992, and is codified, as amended in \n1998 and 2004, under section 354 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. Public Law 102\u2013539, 2, 106 (1992), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 263b. Under the MQSA, all mammography facilities, except facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), must be accredited by an approved accreditation body (AB) and certified by FDA (or an \napproved State certification agency) to provide mammography services. FDA is amending the mammography regulations established under the PHS Act, and sections of the FD&C Act. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f7a6615-31a5-42ca-8933-ea9b8fa6055f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f7a6615-31a5-42ca-8933-ea9b8fa6055f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef1eee99-863a-4919-bce8-ee8b892aa8a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "698cc11a877dadfa72093cdac355aec1c71e0a8777b33bdca23ccb2416fc8ba9"}, "3": {"node_id": "6eb5b6a3-cf44-4d61-b34e-e5e46903a897", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "e6ce5905b62d9d486693d19db5494bf682a5e784b348e2d106ad1dc0c3a2f67f"}}, "hash": "58859f794227fce38e1d82e3e53615d5065e5e5be8a65215bccfa87b3d39cf21", "text": "15127 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nC.

Background \nAccording to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC), in 2018, \nthe most recent year for which numbers are available, over 254,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and more than 42,000 women died of the disease (Ref. 1). According to the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health, in 2020, over 276,000 women were projected to be diagnosed with breast cancer, and over 42,000 women were projected to die of the disease (Ref. 2). Breast cancer is rare in men, with approximately 2,300 new cases and 500 deaths reported in the United States in 2017, according to the CDC (Ref. 3). Among women, however, breast cancer is now the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading \ncause of cancer deaths after lung cancer (Ref. 4).

Health disparity and equity considerations may exist as they relate to mammography practice and density notification, and we have considered \nsociodemographic differences in mammography practice and outcomes. This final rule provides standard requirements that help to ensure that all patients and providers receive complete and consistent breast density information in mammography reports. \nEarly detection of female breast \ncancer, typically involving mammography, is the best means of preventing deaths that can result if the diagnosis is delayed until the onset of more advanced symptoms (Ref. 5). Mammography is a type of medical imaging that uses x-rays to create images (mammograms) of the internal structures of the breasts.

In screen-film mammography, x-rays are transmitted through the breast and expose a sheet of x-ray film enclosed in a cassette. In full field digital mammography, the x-rays go through to an image receptor that is a radiation-sensitive electronic device or plate. Images are displayed on a computer workstation, and can, for example, be digitally magnified. Digital breast tomosynthesis also uses an electronic image receptor and a computer workstation, and obtains multiple images at different angles around the breast, then uses a computer to reconstruct a series of parallel images that resemble slices through the breast. \nMammography can help detect breast \ncancer in its earliest, most treatable stages, when it is too small to be felt or detected by any other method (Ref. 6). \nHowever, as noted by the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO), a mammogram is among the most difficult radiographic images to interpret (Ref. 7). The mammogram must be of high quality for accurate image interpretation. If the image quality is poor, the interpreter may miss a cancerous lesion. Such a false negative diagnosis could delay treatment and result in an avoidable death or increased morbidity. It is equally true that poor quality images or inaccurate interpretations can lead to a false positive diagnosis when normal tissue is misinterpreted as abnormal. This could lead to needless anxiety for the patient, costly additional testing, and unnecessary biopsies. \nA. Need for Amendments to \nMammography Regulations \nMost of the requirements in our \nmammography regulations are over 20 years old. As described below and in the proposed rule (84 FR 11669, March 28, \n2019), major developments in understanding relating to the importance of certain breast anatomy on breast cancer risk have occurred, and FDA believes these developments should be reflected in our nationwide standard. In addition, we are updating our mammography regulations in response to several gaps that we have identified as we have implemented the current regulations. Current regulations do not require that a notification of breast density be part of the report provided to the healthcare provider or the lay summary provided to the patient. However, there is increasing interest in breast density reporting, and States are taking action. Between 2009 and June 2021, 38 States have passed laws mandating notification of breast density (Ref. 8). These State laws impose requirements that vary from State to State. To ensure all patients receive breast density information from their mammograms, and that such required baseline information is consistent, FDA is amending the mammography reporting requirements to require that the written report of the results of the mammographic examination provided to the healthcare provider and the lay summary of the results provided to the patient also include information concerning patient breast density. FDA is also requiring that both the mammography report and lay summary include basic mammography facility identification information. Technology has also advanced since the regulations were issued, so the amended regulations will make changes to reflect current mammography best practices and technologies. \nB. Summary of Comments to the \nProposed Rule \nIn the Federal Register of March 28, \n2019, FDA published a rule proposing amendments to the MQSA regulations. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on June 26, 2019. FDA received many comments on the proposed rule from several entities including medical device associations, industry, medical and healthcare professional associations, public health advocacy groups, law firms, and individuals. While several comments object to particular sections or subsections of the proposed rule, almost all comments voice support for the objective intent of the proposed rule, to establish updates to modernize the MQSA regulations to incorporate current science and mammography best practices. \nSome comments raise concerns or \nrequest clarification regarding: \n\u2022the scope of the MQSA regulations, \n\u2022failure of facility accreditation, \n\u2022retention of personnel records, \n\u2022mammography reports (including \nassessment categories) and lay summaries, \n\u2022breast density notification to \npatients and referring providers, \n\u2022requirements for image retention, \ntransfer of original images, and release of copies, \n\u2022the mammography medical \noutcomes audit, \n\u2022patient and provider notification, \n\u2022the availability and use of various \nimaging modalities, and \n\u2022issues related to clinical decision- \nmaking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e59cb29-166b-41b2-a0e4-815d52b6509c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e59cb29-166b-41b2-a0e4-815d52b6509c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7301a63e-5513-48e0-acb4-e80af5a07a21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "c98be89525ab70832f7b192977bffa09731676302c4d91e2134aa5dc4e530bea"}, "2": {"node_id": "40d33fae-e64c-42af-b027-c76360762159", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "2f596b79570f21f2ff42d9906f69c5d47c3e2e9d0fa15641f4016ac604532825"}}, "hash": "8f4c055128923613c373566050c1244ddea80edacc11198f4840e3d2fa3c1681", "text": "C.

The changes from the proposed rule include the following significant revisions, additions, and removals to the codified section: \n\u2022add or substitute the term \n\u2018\u2018provider\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018healthcare provider\u2019\u2019 in several paragraphs in place of references to referring physician (\u00a7\u00a7 900.2(c)(2), 900.2(k), 900.2(ii), 900.4(f)(1)(ii)(B), and 900.12(j)), \n\u2022revise language to clarify that no AB \nshall accept an application for accreditation from a facility that has had three consecutive failures (\u00a7 900.4(a)(6)(ii)), \n\u2022include additional language \nrequiring that facilities must retain personnel qualification records of former employees for at least 24 months (\u00a7 900.12(a)(4)), \n\u2022remove the proposed term \u2018\u2018digital \naccessory components\u2019\u2019 and clarify the premarket requirements for devices used in mammography (\u00a7 900.12(b)(2)(i)), \n\u2022include additional language \nclarifying that the required final assessment statements are only the \nwords or phrases in quotation marks (\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)), \n\u2022revise the requirement that clinical \nfindings or symptoms in a patient whose mammogram assessment is negative or benign shall be \u2018\u2018documented and addressed,\u2019\u2019 rather than \u2018\u2018explained\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) and (B)), \n\u2022correct the reference to the two \ncategories of breast density that shall be included in the lay summary provided to the patient (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)), \n\u2022include additional language \nclarifying the deadline for sending the mammography report to a self-referred patient when the assessment is \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(i)), \n\u2022include additional language \nclarifying the situations in which a facility must maintain a system for referring self-referred patients to a healthcare provider (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(ii)), \n\u2022revise the breast density \nnotification language that must be included in lay summaries provided to patients with non-dense and dense tissue, respectively (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)), \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a31724f-fa20-42bd-8a23-63f50e4669d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a31724f-fa20-42bd-8a23-63f50e4669d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59981873-857c-4451-bd12-78e4e2eafbac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "63545268513a598cafc0601ae82f18c724ea83996d5ed253dec19f843fb47903"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff3ba95b-bd17-4e8c-9092-0f6b14e13dd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "7c653dc5001f54a00cd9bbc1f2d18ace9aaa94e839d4017e6b86d1d4ba2e0c5a"}}, "hash": "d0acf5f21bb8505014971da54c17a91124d8c37bf0ad17c3337ec83ddd9f7c59", "text": "15130 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \n\u2022add language clarifying the length \nof time a facility is required to maintain \nthe original mammograms and mammography reports in a permanent medical record of the patient by clarifying it is for the longer of the applicable Federal timeframes, or the mandated State or local timeframes (\u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i)), \n\u2022add language clarifying that a \nfacility that ceases to perform \nmammography but continues to operate as a medical entity may retain, rather than transfer, its mammography records (\u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v)), \n\u2022add or substitute the term \u2018\u2018patient\u2019\u2019 \nin place of references to \u2018\u2018women\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018woman\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v) and (f)(1)), \n\u2022add the word \u2018\u2018audit\u2019\u2019 to clarify that \nthe use of certain terms applies to the medical outcomes audit (\u00a7 900.12(f)(1)), and \n\u2022include an amendment changing \nthe name of Healthcare Financing Administration to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and updating the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) office\u2019s name (\u00a7 900.15(d)(1)). \nIV. Legal Authority \nThe MQSA (Pub. L. 102\u2013539) was \nenacted on October 27, 1992, and is \ncodified under section 354 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 263b). Under the MQSA, all mammography facilities, except facilities of the VA, must be accredited by an approved AB and certified by FDA (or an approved State certification agency) to provide mammography services (42 U.S.C. 263b(b)(1) and (d)(1)(iv)). FDA is making these amendments to the mammography regulations (set forth in part 900 (21 CFR part 900)) under section 354 of the PHS Act, and sections of the FD&C Act (sections 519, 537, and 704(e); 21 U.S.C. 360i, 360nn, and 374(e)). \nV. Comments on the Proposed Rule and \nFDA\u2019s Responses \nWe received several sets of comments \non the proposed rule by the close of the comment period, each containing one or more comments on one or more issues. We received comments from medical device associations, industry, medical and healthcare professional associations, public health advocacy groups, law firms, and individuals. We describe and respond to comments in sections A through Z of this document. We have numbered each comment to help distinguish between different comments. We have grouped similar comments together under the same number so that FDA\u2019s responses could be addressed by topic, instead of each comment addressed independently, and, in some cases, we have separated different issues discussed in the same comment and designated them as distinct comments for purposes of our responses. The number assigned to each comment or comment topic is purely for organizational purposes and does not signify the comment\u2019s value or importance or the order in which comments were received or considered. \nA. General Comments on the Proposed \nRule \n(Comment 1) FDA received many \ncomments that express support for the MQSA proposed rule. Some comments express support for requiring density notification to patients and for establishing a national standard for such notification. Other comments respectively express support for the changes to the assessment categories, equipment quality control (QC), and requirements related to the provision of copies of mammograms. Some comments express support for the changes to the patient and provider notification in the event of compromised mammographic quality, which may represent a serious risk to human health, including the notification of nonphysician referring healthcare providers. Another comment compliments FDA on proposing amendments to the regulations, but recommends more frequent changes to respond promptly to new information. \n(Response 1) FDA appreciates the \npublic support for the rule. FDA notes that the notification requirement regarding breast tissue density will enhance communication between patients, interpreting physicians (IP), and referring providers about this important factor in the effectiveness of mammography, and ensure that required baseline information is consistent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff3ba95b-bd17-4e8c-9092-0f6b14e13dd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff3ba95b-bd17-4e8c-9092-0f6b14e13dd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59981873-857c-4451-bd12-78e4e2eafbac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "63545268513a598cafc0601ae82f18c724ea83996d5ed253dec19f843fb47903"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a31724f-fa20-42bd-8a23-63f50e4669d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "d0acf5f21bb8505014971da54c17a91124d8c37bf0ad17c3337ec83ddd9f7c59"}}, "hash": "7c653dc5001f54a00cd9bbc1f2d18ace9aaa94e839d4017e6b86d1d4ba2e0c5a", "text": "FDA also concludes that the other amendments to the regulations (part 900), including the changes to the equipment QC, assessment categories, provision of copies of mammograms, and notification to nonphysician healthcare providers when necessary, will also contribute to improvement in the quality of mammography and of communication about mammography between patients, IPs, and providers. Regarding the recommendation for more frequent changes, FDA notes that it continues to engage with the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee (NMQAAC) and the professional and patient mammography communities regarding the need for changes to the regulations, but the frequency of amendments to the regulations is based on public health \nneed and Agency resources. \n(Comment 2) Several comments \nexpress opposition to the proposed rule, including the following concerns: (1) that patients will not understand that dense tissue is a normal variant, and that the proposed breast density notification will increase their anxiety; (2) that breast cancer information to be given to a patient should be determined only by the patient\u2019s healthcare provider, or that the new requirement places a burden on the healthcare provider; (3) that all medical tests should be interpreted by clinicians with years of training who can identify the findings that require intervention; (4) that ultrasound rather than digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is the method to screen for cancers that are not mammographically visible; and (5) that there is no clinical recommendation to change patient management based on density or to perform additional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for screening dense breasts, and that current evidence contradicts the suggestion that supplemental screening based on breast density reduces breast cancer mortality. The latter comment also recommends that FDA\u2019s suggestion that additional imaging based on density alone may reduce breast cancer mortality should be deleted from the cost and benefit information of the rule. \n(Response 2) FDA acknowledges the \ncomments and responds according to the numbered topics identified in Comment 2: \n(1\u20132) We note that breast tissue \ndensity is an important factor in mammography, both because of the masking effect of dense tissue, which limits the sensitivity of mammography (Refs. 9 to 11), and because density is an independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer (Refs. 12 to 15). FDA concludes that patients benefit from having information about their breast anatomy, and should be \ninformed of their density so that the patient and their healthcare provider can make informed and shared decisions about the patient\u2019s healthcare. This rulemaking provides consistent language for communicating that information, as FDA concludes that there is also a benefit from obtaining baseline information in a consistent manner. \nThe requirement to notify patients \nabout their density is a baseline standard and does not constrain a healthcare provider from further discussing density with the patient. FDA has determined that the benefit of informing patients of their density \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a43cf97-895a-4803-beea-c58d01064bc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a43cf97-895a-4803-beea-c58d01064bc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb7526c2-4157-447b-9224-6f92345551a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "dc0e8a4eba70b24fe2224c3f627e3abcc5bd76d59461817c4bb3e0039b272f92"}, "3": {"node_id": "29222de8-adfd-44bb-898e-6d706ee05e3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "05987d4684e525306ddd20ba8ca930b5833bd6c09852c1c0e8907eabc2fbcf50"}}, "hash": "9d5edbc5a79790dab8c019f333c9f5041f63ff524261ce5eb9b5d0f8327fdf5b", "text": "15131 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \noutweighs both the burden on \nhealthcare providers to provide density information and the risk of patient anxiety. FDA also notes that the Agency received many comments in support of the proposed rule and the breast density notification to patients. FDA also notes that 38 States have passed laws mandating notification of breast density, which may mitigate any potential burden on healthcare providers in those states (Ref. 8). \n(3) The MQSA provides authority to \nFDA to ensure quality mammography, and FDA has determined that the initial and continuing qualification requirements for IPs in \u00a7 900.12(a)(1) are sufficient to ensure that mammograms, including density observations, are interpreted by personnel with adequate training to ensure quality mammography. \n(4\u20135) FDA acknowledges there are \nconflicting comments about the utility of other imaging modalities besides DBT, such as ultrasound, for supplemental screening of women with dense breasts; however, this final rule does not specify any particular supplemental imaging modality or other particular clinical management of patients with dense breasts. FDA has not indicated any particular additional steps in a patient\u2019s care based only on the mammogram, as individual situations and risk factors vary. FDA does not agree that it is appropriate to require the lay summary to include a discussion of all possible breast imaging modalities that may be more effective for some patients than mammography, which would encompass a significant amount of information that may be overwhelming and difficult for patients to interpret (see also Responses 57 and 60). We believe that it is more appropriate for the healthcare provider to discuss this information with the patient and engage in shared clinical decision-making based on the patient\u2019s individual circumstances. In this final rule, to allow patients and their healthcare providers to make shared decisions appropriate for each patient, the notification to these patients in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv) simply states, in part, \u2018\u2018In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers,\u2019\u2019 and advises the patient to discuss their individual situation with their provider (see also Response 62). FDA notes that there is conflicting evidence about the effect of supplemental screening on breast cancer mortality, including Chiu in 2010 (Ref. 16), which found that dense tissue was associated with \nincreased mortality from breast cancer. Therefore, FDA disagrees with the assertion that additional imaging based \non breast density is not relevant, or that the mortality information should be deleted from the economic cost and benefit analysis of the rule. \n(Comment 3) A comment opposes \nmore mammography regulation, and asserts:* that MQSA duplicates an American College of Radiology (ACR) program which \u2018\u2018certifies\u2019\u2019 mammography facilities; that FDA dictating what IPs should say in their reports constitutes the practice of medicine; and that MQSA regulations are driving physicians out of mammography and limiting access. This comment recommends that FDA limit itself to its \u2018\u2018original mandate\u2019\u2019 to ensure that mammography units produce quality images at a reasonable radiation dose. \n(Response 3) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. The ACR does not certify mammography facilities. The MQSA and its implementing regulations distinguish between accreditation and certification (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(e) and (q); part 900, subparts A and C; see also Response 145). The ACR is one of several FDA-approved accreditation bodies. Accreditation, which mainly focuses on the quality of clinical images and phantom images, is one of the prerequisites for facility certification by FDA or a State certifying agency. FDA does not specify which assessment category an IP should assign to a mammogram because this is more appropriately left to the provider\u2019s interpretation in the course of clinical decision-making. However, FDA does provide for the specific phrasing of the final assessment statements, which is standardized in accordance with the MQSA (42 U.S.C. 263b(a)(3)(B)) to ensure clear consistent communication between patients, IPs, and referring \nhealthcare providers. FDA does not track practice rates of IPs or other facility personnel, but is not aware of information showing a decrease in access to mammography services; according to MQSA national statistics (Ref. 17), from November 2003 to February 2022, there has been a 4 percent decrease in the total number of certified facilities across the United States but a 29 percent increase in the total number of mammograms performed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29222de8-adfd-44bb-898e-6d706ee05e3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "29222de8-adfd-44bb-898e-6d706ee05e3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb7526c2-4157-447b-9224-6f92345551a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "dc0e8a4eba70b24fe2224c3f627e3abcc5bd76d59461817c4bb3e0039b272f92"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a43cf97-895a-4803-beea-c58d01064bc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "9d5edbc5a79790dab8c019f333c9f5041f63ff524261ce5eb9b5d0f8327fdf5b"}}, "hash": "05987d4684e525306ddd20ba8ca930b5833bd6c09852c1c0e8907eabc2fbcf50", "text": "Therefore, FDA concludes that these amendments to the MQSA regulations are neither duplicative of the ACR program nor have the existing MQSA regulations had a negative impact on access to mammography. \nB. Scope of the MQSA Regulations \n(Comment 4) Several comments \naddress the scope of the MQSA regulations, including comments that \nsupport the objectives of the proposed rule and/or provide the following recommendations: (1) FDA\u2019s proposal should remove xeromammography from the examples of mammographic modalities, which accompany the definition provided in proposed \u00a7 900.2(z), and replace it with full-field digital mammography (FFDM); (2) FDA should remove screen-film mammography from these examples of modalities; (3) comments that FDA should also add the example of DBT as a modality; (4) that mammography IPs should also be qualified in breast ultrasound; and (5) that FDA should consider requiring mammography facilities to meet additional quality standards, such as the ACR\u2019s Breast Imaging Centers of Excellence (BICOE) program or the American Cancer Society (ACS) National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC), in addition to MQSA certification requirements. \n(Response 4) The scope of FDA\u2019s \nauthority over mammography facilities is established in the MQSA, and, as described in the following and organized according to the numbered topics identified in Comment 4, FDA is adopting limited changes to this rule: \n(1\u20133) The MQSA and its \nimplementing regulations apply only to radiological equipment used in facilities to perform mammographic modalities, which do not include breast sonography or other non-mammographic modalities (42 U.S.C. 263b(a)(5) and (6), (b)(1) and (2)). However, FDA agrees that the modality of DBT has reached wide clinical use and should be listed as an example of a mammographic modality in this rule. Xeromammography is no longer in clinical use in the United States, and screen-film mammography is in limited use. Therefore, in this final rule, FDA is revising the examples of mammographic modalities to remove xeromammography, and to list screen- film mammography, FFDM, and DBT, all of which are currently in clinical use in the United States (see \u00a7 900.2(z) in this final rule). Other modalities are covered by the requirements of the FD&C Act, and may be subject to performance standards prescribed pursuant to section 534 (Electronic Product Radiation Control (EPRC)) of the FD&C Act. \n(4) FDA disagrees with the \nrecommendation to require mammography IPs to also be qualified in breast ultrasound. As noted, the MQSA does not provide for the establishment of requirements related to breast sonography for IPs, other personnel, or facilities. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "715b9ef2-bb89-4ee3-ac16-b002893038ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "715b9ef2-bb89-4ee3-ac16-b002893038ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b3595b0-9021-4a03-a8d7-9a2a3997588b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "ebff706e0d77b71413b01163dc3734408c95c5edc1eb3ebd0876379e48b3204d"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3239f1d-045e-421d-a2d2-1bb3e26c7497", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "374734848f83a82253d20f61f83993cec45160459793374d2dc6bf64f3d701d2"}}, "hash": "39e43f3c9bd23afb524a2831f60a729459d7342dc03d0ca8770e4cb18d70be82", "text": "15132 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \n(5) FDA notes that the ACR BICOE \nprogram covers other breast imaging \nmodalities and interventions in addition to mammography, and the ACS NAPBC covers additional breast imaging as well as other aspects of clinical breast care. Therefore, these programs are not implemented within the scope of the MQSA regulations. \n(Comment 5) Several comments \nrecommend removing the exclusion of invasive interventions for biopsy or localization in \u00a7 900.2(aa)(1) so that they are included within the scope of the MQSA regulations. A separate comment recommends that post-procedure mammograms for marker placement should not be regulated under the MQSA. \n(Response 5) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. The MQSA was enacted by Congress in 1992 due to evidence of poor quality in mammographic imaging in the United States at that time. However, since then, the implementation of the MQSA and the widespread adoption of digital imaging technologies and other technological and QC advances have contributed to quality improvement not only in screening and diagnostic mammography, but also in interventional mammography. The majority of personnel performing interventional mammography also perform non-interventional mammography and are therefore subject to the requirements of the MQSA. Currently, FDA is not aware of information showing significant quality problems with interventional mammography in the United States. At this time, FDA concludes that it is not necessary to introduce regulations covering interventional mammography. \nUnlike the targeted images of a small \nportion of the breast that are typically performed during localization or intervention, a post-procedure mammogram typically includes the entire breast; may be performed using general mammography equipment rather than dedicated interventional equipment; and is often logged, reported, and charged as an independent examination, separate from the interventional procedure that precedes it. Therefore, FDA concludes that this post-procedure examination should continue to meet the quality standards mandated under the MQSA regulations. As discussed in Responses 32, 38, and 39, this final rule includes the assessment statement \u2018\u2018Post- Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement,\u2019\u2019 which may be appropriate for such mammograms (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(G)). (Comment 6) Several comments \nsuggest that the MQSA regulations \nshould be expanded to cover other imaging modalities in addition to mammography, including ultrasound and MRI. \n(Response 6) The MQSA was passed \nby Congress in 1992 in response to evidence of poor quality in mammographic imaging in the United States at that time (42 U.S.C. 263b). As we noted in Response 4, the MQSA applies only to mammographic imaging. As such, the MQSA does not provide for the establishment of requirements related to breast sonography or MRI, and the MQSA regulations have not been amended to include such modalities. \n(Comment 7) A comment \nrecommends that medical offices be required to display posters depicting breast anatomy and to distribute literature regarding breast physical examination. \n(Response 7) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. FDA notes that the shared clinical decision-making process generally takes place between the patient and their referring healthcare provider or other clinical healthcare provider, not with the interpreting physician at the mammography facility, and therefore does not agree that there is a need to require posters of breast anatomy at mammography facilities, although facilities may choose to display patient education resources. Referring healthcare providers who order mammography studies, and are not themselves the reviewing physicians \nof the clinical images at issue (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(a)(8)), are not generally subject to the requirements specified in the MQSA and its implementing regulations. Clinical healthcare providers may provide such patient education resources if they choose to do so, but this recommendation is outside the scope of this final rulemaking. \nC. Repeated Failure To Achieve \nAccreditation \n(Comment 8) Several comments \nexpress concerns with the number and type of accreditation failures after which an AB may not accept a facility\u2019s application for accreditation for 1 year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3239f1d-045e-421d-a2d2-1bb3e26c7497": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3239f1d-045e-421d-a2d2-1bb3e26c7497", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b3595b0-9021-4a03-a8d7-9a2a3997588b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "ebff706e0d77b71413b01163dc3734408c95c5edc1eb3ebd0876379e48b3204d"}, "2": {"node_id": "715b9ef2-bb89-4ee3-ac16-b002893038ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "39e43f3c9bd23afb524a2831f60a729459d7342dc03d0ca8770e4cb18d70be82"}}, "hash": "374734848f83a82253d20f61f83993cec45160459793374d2dc6bf64f3d701d2", "text": "One comment recommends that this provision be revised to apply to a facility that has \u2018\u2018failed to become accredited after four consecutive failures\u2019\u2019; another comment recommends that this be revised to apply to a facility which has \u2018\u2018failed to become accredited after four failed accreditation cycles\u2019\u2019; and another comment recommends that this be revised to apply to a facility that has had \u2018\u2018three consecutive failures of accreditation granting cycles.\u2019\u2019 Two of \nthese comments also express concern over the effect of this provision on the timing of the AB\u2019s onsite visit to the facility to provide oversight and hands- on training. \n(Response 8) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. The Agency believes that a facility that has failed to become accredited after three consecutive attempts should not be permitted to become accredited until it has implemented all necessary corrective actions and any other necessary changes, such as additional training or personnel changes, specific to the facility\u2019s individual situation (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(6)(ii) in this final rule). The Agency believes that the 1-year waiting period will allow the facility sufficient time to make these corrections. Regarding the terminology used for these failures, the Agency notes that the various FDA-approved ABs currently use different terms, such as \u2018\u2018deficiency\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018failure,\u2019\u2019 for the initial failure to become accredited. Therefore, FDA concludes that the phrasing of the provision, \u2018\u2018If a facility has failed to become accredited after three consecutive attempts,\u2019\u2019 is sufficiently clear and broad to apply to facilities accredited by any AB. Regarding the AB onsite visits to facilities, the various ABs currently have different policies for the timing of their onsite visits, each respectively approved by FDA. FDA notes that, upon publication of this final rule, the ABs can review and, if needed, revise their procedures to accommodate the change in the regulations, including to account for any procedures to address tracking the number of facility applications submitted to an AB, and submit their proposed policy changes to FDA for review and approval. \n(Comment 9) Some comments \nrecommend that facilities not be allowed to switch ABs in order to avoid this 1-year exclusion after three \nconsecutive failed attempts at accreditation. \n(Response 9) FDA agrees with this \nrecommendation. Accordingly, we are revising \u00a7 900.4(a)(6)(ii) to state \u2018\u2018If a facility has failed to become accredited after three consecutive attempts, no AB shall accept an application for accreditation from the facility for a period of 1 year from the date of the most recent accreditation failure.\u2019\u2019 \n(Comment 10) Some comments \naddress the situation of a facility with more than one mammography unit, of which one unit fails to receive accreditation but one or more units receive accreditation.

The provision that was proposed for revision refers to overall facility accreditation (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(6)(ii) in both the proposed and final rule) as opposed to individual unit accreditation (see \u00a7\u00a7 900.4(e) and 900.12(e)). FDA acknowledges that some reasons for the failure of a facility to receive accreditation, such as a mechanical deficiency in a mammography unit, may be limited to that particular unit, while other reasons for failure, such as poor patient positioning, may extend to the practice of mammography throughout the entire facility. The various FDA-approved ABs have policies to address the requirements for accreditation of a facility that has multiple mammography units. The ABs also have policies regarding the circumstances, including poor quality noted on accreditation images, which may prompt an AMR to assess the overall quality of mammography at a facility. FDA believes that if a facility fails three consecutive attempts to receive accreditation, it should be subject to a 1-year waiting period to allow the facility adequate time to address issues that have prevented accreditation (see also Response 8). FDA anticipates that the ABs may review their policies and procedures, and if needed, may decide to submit revised policies and procedures to FDA (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(8)) to conform to this provision of the final rule; if the ABs do so, the Agency will review and consider the ABs\u2019 proposals. \n(Comment 11) A comment \nrecommends that a facility under its third provisional certificate have all exams double-read by a qualified IP from an accredited and certified facility, until the applying facility either fails or receives accreditation. \n(Response 11) FDA disagrees with \nadding this requirement to the regulations. Such increased oversight of facilities with provisional certificates is not appropriate in this circumstance, \nconsidering that there are existing regulations requiring corrective action. Depending on the specific circumstances of the failure, the applying facility\u2019s AB will either have required the facility to perform corrective action after the first two failures, or will first have performed an AMR to determine the extent and severity of the quality problems at the \nfacility (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(1)(i)), and will have required corrective action (see \u00a7\u00a7 900.4(a)(1)(ii) and 900.4(b)(3)). Corrective action is individualized by the AB for the specific facility, but often includes requirements for additional training for the facility personnel. Therefore, FDA concludes that the IP and other personnel will be sufficiently trained to correct the quality problems at the facility. \n(Comment 12) A comment \nrecommends clearer language about the facility\u2019s next steps, corrective action, \u2018\u2018necessary information,\u2019\u2019 and the duration of effectiveness of a provisional certificate for a facility that has had a year-long waiting period after having failed to become accredited after three consecutive attempts. The same comment recommends clearer language about FDA\u2019s action if a facility fails accreditation for a third time, and also recommends that a facility be permanently ineligible to provide mammography services after a fourth failure. \n(Response 12) Regarding improving \nclarity about the process for reapplying for accreditation, FDA disagrees with this comment. The process is subject to the policies and procedures of each AB, and the Agency notes that the necessary information as well as the steps to apply for accreditation are clearly specified by each AB\u2019s policies and procedures (see, e.g., \u00a7 900.4(e) and (f)). We further note \nthat the duration of effectiveness of a provisional certificate is already discussed in current \u00a7 900.11(b) and (c). Regarding the commenter\u2019s recommendation that a facility be ineligible to provide mammography services after a fourth failure, FDA concludes that a facility that has performed all required corrective action may reapply for accreditation, but notes that, in accordance with AB policies, an AB may take into account the facility\u2019s entire history and practice of mammography, such as a lack of improvement after multiple corrective actions, in considering a decision to suspend or revoke the facility\u2019s accreditation, or to revoke its application for accreditation (see \u00a7 900.4(a) and (b)).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07a0188d-8d2a-41da-b1fc-7646706fdafd": {"__data__": {"id_": "07a0188d-8d2a-41da-b1fc-7646706fdafd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a60c7439-6d95-48be-b299-a24c32476e80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "45ec52105a59cced5ffd0dbc5217405003851760661b0beda6d13a12908b4d00"}, "2": {"node_id": "399fb23c-7a2b-4264-b5cd-ad7c5cd10bc5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "954b11719916f8a8bd3b29d670786fa8d0e2190704f973f835285fbee2861150"}}, "hash": "76814b9f5dd19a71b8e9b7efc4c179c05c07519d2b7030863e98ba8f172b763e", "text": "Also, the AB must notify FDA if it believes that a facility\u2019s practice of mammography may pose a serious risk to human health (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(2)). Likewise, the Agency may take into account the facility\u2019s entire history in determining that its practice poses a serious risk to human health and in considering the suspension or revocation of a facility\u2019s certificate (see \n\u00a7 900.14). Therefore, FDA concludes that a facility whose practice warrants such a determination will be identified, \nand appropriate accreditation and/or certificate actions will be taken. Finally, as noted in Responses 8 and 10, if the ABs review their policies and procedures in light of this provision of the final rule and decide to submit revised policies and procedures to FDA (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(8)), the Agency will review and consider those policies and procedures. \nD. Retention and Release of Personnel \nRecords \n(Comment 13) Several comments were \nsubmitted that recommend specifying the amount of time that a facility must retain personnel records for employees that are no longer at that facility. Some comments recommend that facilities only be required to keep the records for former employees from the time of one inspection to the time of the next annual inspection. Another comment recommends that facilities only be required to give employees their records at the time of the employees\u2019 departure. Other comments recommend that facilities be required to keep personnel records for former employees for 24 months following the departure of that employee. \n(Response 13) FDA agrees that a \nminimum length of time should be included in the amendments to the regulations for the personnel records retention requirement. We note that previous employees may need access to these personnel records to document their MQSA qualifications to permit them to provide mammography services at other facilities. Accordingly, we conclude that former employees should have an opportunity to obtain their personnel records for a time period beyond the immediate date of their departure from a facility. After considering the comments on this requirement, we are revising and finalizing the provision as follows: \u2018\u2018Records of personnel no longer employed by the facility must be maintained for no less than 24 months from the date of the departure of an employee, and these records must be available for review at the time of any annual inspection occurring during \nthose 24 months\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(4) in this final rule). FDA has made this change to the codified language to clarify that the records must be available during an inspection that can occur at any point during the 24 months after which an employee departs, which better aligns with the records retention requirement and is distinct from any FDA determination regarding compliance with the MQSA and its implementing regulations that would \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63b270f5-c144-47a5-8b1f-d19070cddebe": {"__data__": {"id_": "63b270f5-c144-47a5-8b1f-d19070cddebe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "359f575a-3371-4beb-9771-2bc946b4f49b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6359164ce653885311780f1309bdbb5263310af0f47cb8be049c9744b7fd8f13"}, "3": {"node_id": "b644c850-3ee0-4610-8638-fe72d491c188", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6574da1c7527d4e80035073a530d7e414b5039f0dd62b1a4fecfd5acea758456"}}, "hash": "011c9ca2f147039f69e52945264774c95d930b2e3155c3436016fe250da39c11", "text": "15134 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \notherwise occur following the next \nannual inspection after the employee departs. FDA is also revising the provision to distinguish and clarify the requirements for providing such records to current and former employees, as follows: \u2018\u2018The facility shall provide copies of these personnel records to current interpreting physicians (IPs), radiologic technologists, and medical physicists upon their request. Facilities must provide personnel records to former employees if the former employees communicate their request within 24 months of the date of their departure. If it has been greater than 24 months and the facility has maintained those records, the facility must provide those records to former employees upon request.\u2019\u2019 \n(Comment 14) Rather than providing \nrecords after an employee leaves, a comment recommends that facilities should require a qualifications package for each employee that would only be retained until after the first inspection following the hiring of that employee, at which point the package should be given to the employee to retain, and any continuing experience or other information would be accumulated and maintained from the time that the qualifications package is given to the employee. \n(Response 14) FDA disagrees with this \ncomment. Personnel qualifications under \u00a7 900.12(a) include both initial and continuing requirements, and both components are reviewed at the time of inspection (Ref. 18). The personnel record keeping requirements apply to facilities, not individual personnel (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(d)(1)(A)(ii)(III), (B)(ii)(II), \nand (g)(1)(C), and \u00a7 900.12(a)(4)). Therefore, each facility is required to document the qualifications of its personnel. Also, FDA is concerned that the comment\u2019s recommended changes would not be as effective as the current system in maintaining the necessary documentation of qualification of a facility\u2019s personnel. \n(Comment 15) A comment \nrecommends that FDA specify a penalty for facilities that do not adhere to the personnel records requirement. \n(Response 15) FDA agrees with this \ncomment. A facility that does not comply with the personnel records retention requirement (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(4) in this final rule) may receive a citation at the time that this failure is identified at inspection, in a manner similar to other comparable violations (Ref. 18). The totality and severity of violations identified at inspection determine the consequences for the facility. \n(Comment 16) A comment \nrecommends that facilities should only need to provide personnel records to former employees if the employee submits the request in written format. \n(Response 16) FDA disagrees with this \nrecommendation. FDA concludes that requiring requests from former employees for their personnel records to be transmitted in writing may be overly burdensome to both facilities and former employees because it may delay how quickly a facility would receive the request, and may reduce access to mammography by delaying how quickly those records could be provided to facilities evaluating the qualifications of new personnel. FDA believes that minimizing barriers to the provision of qualification records to former employees will facilitate the hiring of these personnel at other facilities, thus preserving patient access to mammography services. \n(Comment 17) A comment \nrecommends that facilities give personnel records to personnel when the facility ceases performing mammography, and it also asks for clarification as to whether the phrase \u2018\u2018ceases to perform mammography\u2019\u2019 refers to the facility or to specific personnel. \n(Response 17) The final rule states \nthat \u2018\u2018Before a facility closes or ceases to perform mammography services, it must make arrangements for access by current and former personnel to their MQSA records,\u2019\u2019 and that this may be accomplished by either \u2018\u2018the permanent transfer of these records to the personnel or the transfer of the records to a facility or other entity that will provide access to these records for no less than 24 months from the date of facility closure or cessation of mammography services\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(4)). FDA believes that these two pathways provide adequate access for personnel to their MQSA records. The primary reason that personnel may require access to their qualification records is that they are continuing to practice mammography at other facilities. Therefore, the clause \u2018\u2018Before a facility closes or ceases to provide mammography services\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(4) in this final rule) refers to the closure or cessation of mammography services of a facility and not to the cessation of specific personnel from practicing mammography.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b644c850-3ee0-4610-8638-fe72d491c188": {"__data__": {"id_": "b644c850-3ee0-4610-8638-fe72d491c188", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "359f575a-3371-4beb-9771-2bc946b4f49b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6359164ce653885311780f1309bdbb5263310af0f47cb8be049c9744b7fd8f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "63b270f5-c144-47a5-8b1f-d19070cddebe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "011c9ca2f147039f69e52945264774c95d930b2e3155c3436016fe250da39c11"}}, "hash": "6574da1c7527d4e80035073a530d7e414b5039f0dd62b1a4fecfd5acea758456", "text": "(Comment 18) A comment requests \nthat FDA provide guidance on how to demonstrate compliance with the requirement to provide access for personnel to their MQSA records when a facility closes or ceases mammography services. (Response 18) The Agency believes \nthat the current regulations, and the \nregulations being revised at \u00a7 900.12(a)(4) in this final rule, are clear on the requirements regarding personnel records for facilities that close or cease to provide mammography services. Facilities that close or cease to perform mammography services should inform their AB, which will assist them in complying with record retention obligations and other applicable MQSA requirements. (Ref. 19.) \nE. Digital Accessories \n(Comment 19) Several comments \nrequest that FDA provide additional \nclarification of the definition of a digital accessory component, or ask for clarity on whether specific equipment, such as display monitors, are included in this category. \n(Response 19) FDA defines an \n\u2018\u2018accessory\u2019\u2019 of a device as \u2018\u2018A finished device that is intended to support, supplement, and/or augment the performance of one or more parent devices\u2019\u2019 (Ref. 20). Because a device accessory is a \u2018\u2018device,\u2019\u2019 we believe the broader term \u2018\u2018devices\u2019\u2019 is simpler and allows for a clearer understanding of the mammography regulations. In this final rule, we are revising \u00a7 900.12(b)(2)(i) for clarity, to state that \u2018\u2018All devices used in mammography must have met the applicable FDA premarket authorization requirements for medical devices of that type and intended use.\u2019\u2019 This applies to devices used in the acquisition, processing, or display of digital mammographic images. For example, a \ndisplay device used in the interpretation of digital mammographic images generally needs to have 510(k) clearance prior to being used in a mammographic facility. Not all equipment needs clearance or approval; for example, some devices, such as medical image storage devices, may be exempted from premarket notification requirements. (It is important to consult the appropriate classification regulation to determine the premarket authorization requirements.) \n(Comment 20) Several comments \nrecommend changing the effective date for the digital accessory component requirements from 18 months to 24 months. \n(Response 20) FDA disagrees with the \nrecommendation to extend the effective date to 24 months after publication of this final rule.

The current \u2018\u2018ACR Digital Mammography Quality Control Manual for Full-Field Digital Mammography Systems and Supplement for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Mammography Systems\u2019\u2019 has been approved as applicable to any facility as alternative standard #24 (Ref. 21; see also \u00a7 900.18(f)). The use of approved alternative standards such as the ACR QC manual as they relate to digital accessories remains acceptable; however, since the ACR manual may undergo future revisions, and a revision would have to undergo FDA review to determine whether it is at least as effective in ensuring quality mammography as the standard it proposes to replace, the current ACR manual is not specified in the codified section of the final rule. \n(Comment 22) A comment expresses \nconcern that a facility using displays that are not specific for mammography or for a use that could include mammography would be in violation. Another comment suggests that, if a manufacturer QC procedure exists, there is no need for FDA premarket authorization of displays, and continues that there is no need for FDA premarket authorization for equipment since there \nare alternative standards for QC from the ACR. A comment also asserts that the process by which FDA clears or approves displays is not transparent. \n(Response 22) These comments tend \nto confuse two separate processes: (1) the premarket approval or clearance of a medical device as described in 21 CFR 807.81 and (2) the MQSA requirements for mammography facilities under 42 U.S.C. 263b and the implementing regulations under part 900. Medical devices are subject to FDA\u2019s medical device requirements, which may include premarket authorization. Mammography equipment must also meet MQSA regulatory requirements that govern its use in a mammography facility. \nFDA premarket authorization of a \ndisplay intended for use in interpreting mammography images is a premarket device requirement; however, after this final rule becomes effective, any applicable premarket authorization requirements will also be required \nunder the MQSA quality standards for use of the display for interpreting mammography images (see \u00a7 900.12(b)(2)(i) in this final rule). Therefore, FDA agrees with the comment that a facility interpreting mammograms using a display that has not met the applicable FDA premarket authorization requirements for use in interpreting mammography images would generally be in violation of the MQSA quality standards regulations. \nThe QC tests for a display are another \nMQSA quality standard required for use of that display for mammography interpretation (see \u00a7 900.12(e)(6)), but the existence of QC tests for a display is generally not sufficient to satisfy all FDA premarket regulatory requirements that may apply to the device. Likewise, the existence of a QC program for other mammography equipment does not generally satisfy all the premarket regulatory requirements applicable to that equipment. Regarding the comment that states there are QC procedures available from ACR, we also note that facilities that adopt the ACR QC manual for the QC of their FFDM or DBT system may not limit the use of the manual to a single piece of equipment or accessory, such as a display, while following a different QC program (such as the manufacturer\u2019s QC manual) for the mammography unit (Refs. 21 and 22), and we reiterate that the existence of a QC program does not necessarily reflect that any applicable FDA premarket authorization requirements are being met. \nRegarding the comment on the clarity \nof FDA premarket review process for mammography displays, the premarket requirements for displays that are intended to be used in interpreting mammography images, among others, are discussed in 21 CFR 892.2050 and FDA\u2019s guidance \u2018\u2018Display Devices for Diagnostic Radiology\u2019\u2019 (Ref. 23). \n(Comment 23) A comment states that \nthe requirement that mammograms \nsubmitted for interpretation be \u2018\u2018presented in the mammographic modality\u2019\u2019 in which they were originally produced is unclear, and suggests that mammograms are being read on a device not intended for mammography.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "135b982b-0048-475f-9758-49e2d6b7352b": {"__data__": {"id_": "135b982b-0048-475f-9758-49e2d6b7352b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d97a816c-2ff1-4783-a02d-e2b7798c2240", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "e1713ba4220ed15d815280c44da00d552c9e4d74d0ffa1df60dcf8902d2e54b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebe92c0b-9801-4091-9a83-e4705b35b6c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "a810ad6d4ec86497267f1c7226d9286f302d1cc011e23e3e04be55caf6b29fb8"}}, "hash": "d9e2d7695085fe13b060c0115bd9ca4d83dfd92cd7d6a8e3ba6bb47068f2d6d8", "text": "The comment also recommends including a statement to caution facilities that they should be aware of potential compatibility issues in their imaging/ reading chain. \n(Response 23) The requirement that \nmammograms be presented for interpretation in the mammographic modality in which they were originally produced means, for example, that screen-film mammograms must be presented for interpretation as the \noriginal hardcopy films, and not digitized or scanned. FDA does not agree that this requirement would reasonably be interpreted to mean that mammograms are being read on equipment not intended for mammography. FDA notes that all equipment used for mammography must be specifically designed for mammography (see \u00a7 900.12(b)(2) in this final rule) and that all devices used in mammography (including displays, as discussed in Responses 19 and 22) must have met the applicable FDA premarket authorization requirements for medical devices of that type and intended use (see \u00a7 900.12(b)(2)(i) in this final rule). FDA agrees that facilities are responsible for ensuring that any equipment they use in the acquisition, processing, interpretation, retention, and retrieval of mammographic images be compatible, in order to facilitate mammography practice and to allow compliance with the record retention, transfer, and release provisions in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4) of this final rule. The Agency does not believe it is necessary to include a cautionary statement in the final rule, as facilities in the course of their practice of mammography will readily be able to determine whether their equipment is interoperable. \nF. Facility Identification Information in \nMammography Report and Lay Summary \n(Comment 24) A comment requests \nclarification, in the case of a facility that is associated with a centralized entity that sends reports and summaries, as to whether the centralized entity may be the only name on the report or summary, whether an abbreviated name for the actual facility is acceptable, and whether an alias (e.g., \u2018\u2018Doing Business \nAs\u2019\u2019 or DBA) is required to appear on the report. The commenter also requests clarification of the required timeframe for a facility to report a name change. \n(Response 24) FDA distinguishes each \nmammography facility based on its physical location (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(a)(3) and \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(ii) in this final rule). Healthcare networks that offer mammography services at several \nlocations are accredited and certified as several separate facilities. The name recognized by FDA for a facility is the name under which the facility is accredited by its AB (see \u00a7 900.11(b)). Therefore, the facility identification information in the report to the healthcare provider (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(ii) in this final rule) and the lay summary sent to the patient (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) in this final rule) must be unique to the actual facility where the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4f92ab7-a840-41a8-8fbb-1c9f9e7338ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4f92ab7-a840-41a8-8fbb-1c9f9e7338ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70bce843-fbac-4ceb-866b-f170e4d255d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "9a6560ea04fdeea8a6e501887eb220aaa4fbf5513f95383a3343470d9e43783a"}, "3": {"node_id": "41a994dc-e9e0-43fe-ad0c-b4dda19bb772", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "b7a87a86bbe4deafb8d297642da85c1ddf67bceed9a39ac1b7e566d7fa238f95"}}, "hash": "2eca0a625896807d5794b57704effa1f32e4ea72ad967ec70bf27dab878240c2", "text": "15136 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nmammogram was performed, and must \ninclude the name under which the facility is accredited and certified.

Typically, a mammogram will be interpreted only once, and will have only a single report and a single lay summary. In some cases, a mammogram that has already been interpreted and for which a report and lay summary have been issued is subsequently presented to another IP for a repeat interpretation or \u2018\u2018second opinion.\u2019\u2019 By referencing determinations made by an \u2018\u2018outside consultant,\u2019\u2019 the commenter may either be referring to a later IP rendering such an additional opinion on an examination that has already been interpreted, or may be referring to an IP who is a contractor to a facility (rather than a facility employee) rendering the initial or sole interpretation. If the comment refers to the reinterpretation of a previously interpreted mammogram, the second (or subsequent) IP must also meet the existing personnel requirements of \u00a7 900.12(a)(1), and must separately comply with the reporting requirements of \u00a7 900.12(c) in this final rule. To help distinguish them from the original interpretation, we recommend that a second (or subsequent) report and lay summary be identified as a second opinion or similar term. If the comment refers to a report rendered by an IP who is a contractor or consultant to the facility rather than a facility employee, that IP must also meet all personnel requirements, and the report and lay summary must meet all reporting requirements. \n(Comment 26) Several comments \naddress the required identification information in the lay summary. A comment asserts that most facilities already provide facility identification in the lay summary. Another comment \nrecommends that the patient name and the facility information be required in the lay summary. A separate comment recommends that the summary include separately both the contact information of the facility or business where a patient can request images and records, and the actual physical location where the mammography services were provided. Another comment \nrecommends that FDA not specify the information that is required \u2018\u2018at a minimum,\u2019\u2019 but rather specify all required information, including the facility telephone number, email address, and instructions for clear communication. \n(Response 26) FDA agrees that there \nhave been situations in which the facility information in the lay summary was inadequate. FDA concludes that the expanded requirements in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) of the final rule will enhance communication between the facility, the patient, and the referring provider, and lead to improved patient care. Because, as noted in Response 24, FDA identifies each facility by its unique location (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(1), in both the proposed and final rule), the location of the facility where the mammogram was performed must be included in the lay summary. In response to the comment recommending that a facility\u2019s parent company information be included in the header, FDA does not agree that such additional information should be required because FDA identifies each facility by its unique location and not by any affiliation with a network or company. However, a facility may choose to include additional information about a healthcare network, affiliated site, or records storage site. In addition, FDA agrees with the recommendation that the facility telephone number be included with the lay summary, and notes that \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) of both the proposed and final rule include this requirement. Because in FDA\u2019s experience, some facilities do not have email addresses, and some others communicate through patient portals, FDA disagrees with the recommendation to require that the lay summary include an email address or instructions for clear communication between the patient and the facility. FDA notes that facilities may choose to include this additional contact information. \n(Comment 27) A comment \nrecommends that the lay summary be required to include the name of the IP, so that patients will know who is involved with their care, and if dissatisfied, can request a different IP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41a994dc-e9e0-43fe-ad0c-b4dda19bb772": {"__data__": {"id_": "41a994dc-e9e0-43fe-ad0c-b4dda19bb772", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70bce843-fbac-4ceb-866b-f170e4d255d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "9a6560ea04fdeea8a6e501887eb220aaa4fbf5513f95383a3343470d9e43783a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4f92ab7-a840-41a8-8fbb-1c9f9e7338ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "2eca0a625896807d5794b57704effa1f32e4ea72ad967ec70bf27dab878240c2"}}, "hash": "b7a87a86bbe4deafb8d297642da85c1ddf67bceed9a39ac1b7e566d7fa238f95", "text": "(Response 27) FDA does not believe it \nis necessary to require the name of the \nIP as part of the lay summary. A facility may choose to include this information, but it is not required. The Agency notes that the lay summary is prepared after the examination has been interpreted, so adding the name of the IP to the lay summary will not intervene early enough for the patient to request a different IP. A patient who prefers a particular IP would have to discuss such \na request with the facility staff before the mammogram is interpreted. After interpretation by the IP, FDA notes that the name of the IP is included in the report to the referring provider, per \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iii), and the patient can request the name either from the facility or from the referring provider. \nG. Final and Incomplete Assessments \nand Lay Summaries \n(Comment 28) A comment \nrecommends that FDA clarify the limits of the required assessment language for each mammographic assessment category, and recommends that the rule preserve the concept that the assessment statement is required, while the explanatory language is not required to be included in the mammography report. \n(Response 28) For each assessment \ncategory, the required assessment statement is only the word or phrase in quotation marks (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(iv) in this final rule). As in the existing regulations, each assessment statement, identified in quotation marks, is followed by explanatory language, which is not in quotation marks; this explanatory language not in quotation marks is intended to provide an explanation of the assessment category in order to promote its consistent use, but it is not part of the assessment statement, and is not required to be included in the report to the referring healthcare provider nor in the lay summary to the patient. This format of an assessment statement in quotation \nmarks followed by explanatory language outside the quotation marks was also used in the existing regulations, and FDA is not aware of significant confusion caused by this format. In both the proposed and final rule, \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) through (G), the explanatory language is distinguished from the assessment statement by the closing quotation mark at the end of the assessment. For added clarity, in this final rule we are revising \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) to add the parenthetical clarification, \u2018\u2018the assessment statement is only the word or phrase within the quotation marks.\u2019\u2019 We are also revising \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) to replace the colon with a period within the quotation marks surrounding each assessment statement, to further clarify the distinction between the required statement and its explanatory language. \n(Comment 29) A comment asserts that \nthe negative and benign assessment categories are functionally equivalent and recommends combining them. \n(Response 29) FDA disagrees with this \ncomment.

Another comment recommends that the verbiage explaining the term \u2018\u2018Benign\u2019\u2019 not be required to be in the report. \n(Response 30) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment that the \u2018\u2018Benign\u2019\u2019 phrasing would be confusing to patients. We note that the explanatory language following the word \u2018\u2018Benign\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(B) in this final rule is not part of the assessment statement. It is intended only to explain the category to IPs and other facility personnel, and is not required to be included in the report to the referring provider nor in the lay summary to the patient; therefore, patients are unlikely to be presented with such phrasing. We further note that even the word \u2018\u2018Benign\u2019\u2019 need not be stated to the patient; a patient summary in lay terms of either a negative or a benign report might say, for example, \u2018\u2018Your mammogram is normal,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Your mammogram shows no sign of cancer,\u2019\u2019 or similar phrasing. \n(Comment 31) A comment \nrecommends that, in the parenthetical statement \u2018\u2018if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical findings or symptoms, despite the benign assessment, these shall be explained\u2019\u2019 (in proposed \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(B)), the word \u2018\u2018explained\u2019\u2019 should be revised to \u2018\u2018documented.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 31) FDA agrees in part with \nthe comment. The parenthetical statement in the explanation of the benign assessment category is intended to mirror the existing parenthetical \nstatement in the explanation of the negative assessment category (in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A)), \u2018\u2018if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical findings or symptoms, despite the negative assessment, these shall be explained.\u2019\u2019 However, FDA agrees with the commenter that the IP may not always be able to explain the clinical finding or symptom in a patient with a negative or benign mammogram. Furthermore, the IP may have clinical information from a patient history form or interview that is not yet known to the referring healthcare provider, and is therefore not addressed by the subsequent requirement in proposed \n\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vii) that \u2018\u2018All clinical questions raised by the referring healthcare provider shall be addressed in the report to the extent possible, even if the assessment is negative or benign.\u2019\u2019 FDA believes that this pertinent clinical information should be documented and, if possible, explained or otherwise addressed. Therefore, the Agency concludes that these parenthetical statements should be retained, with revision as suggested, for the negative assessment category (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A)) and for the benign assessment category (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(B)). As such, FDA is revising the parenthetical language in this final rule for the negative and benign categories, respectively, to state that \u2018\u2018if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical findings or symptoms, despite the negative assessment, these shall be documented and addressed,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical findings or symptoms, despite the benign assessment, these shall be documented and addressed.\u2019\u2019 \n(Comment 32) A comment requests \nconfirmation that the new assessment categories are part of the alternative standard approved in 2003.

These \nstatements reflect FDA\u2019s recognition that some mammograms require comparison for interpretation, while some mammograms require additional imaging to reach a final interpretation. \nThe only authorized assessment \nstatements are those in the quality standards and the approved alternative standards (Refs. 22 and 24; see also \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) and 900.18). In addition, as described in the MQSA \nPolicy Guidance Help System (PGHS), FDA has acknowledged that some closely worded variations of the approved assessment statements may generally be acceptable where the particular wording does not change the meaning of the category (Ref. 26). \n(Comment 33) A comment expresses \nconcern that the reporting requirements, which seemingly would allow for an automated process of an IP selecting prepared comments that match the assessment categories, do not include an assessment statement or comment for patients with a history of breast cancer surgery who are subsequently undergoing routine screening. \n(Response 33) Although FDA places \nrequirements on the wording of the assessment statement used to describe the assessment category selected by the IP to promote clarity of communication between the IP and the referring clinical healthcare provider, we anticipate that the mammography report may include additional information about the findings of the examination, before the concluding assessment statement. FDA agrees that, after an IP examines the images, the IP may select prepared statements that in the IP\u2019s judgment accurately describe the findings of the examination, and likewise may select the final assessment from a prepared list of the approved assessment statements. The Agency anticipates that there will be some mammograms whose findings necessitate additional nonstandard statements within the report, but the report must conclude with one of the standard approved assessment statements listed in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) through (G). As applicable to the commenter\u2019s example, the patient\u2019s history of cancer and prior surgery, and any relevant post-surgical findings on the images, may be described in the report, but it must conclude with a final assessment chosen from the approved statements; for example, \u2018\u2018Benign\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(B)) or \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(D)). The Agency does not believe it is necessary to add a unique assessment statement for patients with the history described by the commenter, as the statements listed in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) through (G) are adequate to encompass patients who \nhave previously had breast cancer and those who have had surgery, whether for cancer or other reasons. \n(Comment 34) A comment mentions \nthe potential limitations of a mammogram when a patient either cannot cooperate with or cannot understand instructions, and recommends that FDA add assessment categories that reflect these limitations, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "514a8ccd-b652-4a6e-93cc-3a204cf289a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "514a8ccd-b652-4a6e-93cc-3a204cf289a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7694fd88-4898-4060-ba5b-8425bc7f573c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "f670bb697b134301dbb4bd9dbd94105e1d2594476feff17c92859a9a20ea2c87"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd89b2ff-8054-4cc5-9deb-0ba363c2610f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "2f92d6652ab6ab36a466694b5cb07f1e535655470cc60b00d6fd965d483f30f4"}}, "hash": "9708d8c640a71292bd1efd550333abe07c36e3a388de6cdbcda8ff965ccd187f", "text": "15138 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nincluding \u2018\u2018Benign with technical \nlimitation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Normal with technical limitation.\u2019\u2019 Similarly, another comment mentions the limitation of dense breast tissue and recommends that FDA add an assessment category for \u2018\u2018Normal but dense.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 34) FDA agrees that some \nmammograms have technical limitations, but concludes that the limitations should be documented elsewhere in the report, not in the assessment statement. For clarity, the assessment statement should represent only the IP\u2019s final conclusion about the results of the examination. The limitation of breast density is addressed elsewhere in this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) through (D)). In particular, the limitations conferred by dense tissue must be stated elsewhere in the report, using the language in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(C) of the final rule, \u2018\u2018The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses,\u2019\u2019 or \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(D) of the final rule, \u2018\u2018The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.\u2019\u2019 \n(Comment 35) Several comments \naddress the assessment category \u2018\u2018Suspicious,\u2019\u2019 which the commenters erroneously refer to as a numerical category 4. These comments recommend that the use of alphanumeric subcategories 4a, 4b, and 4c be allowed, be encouraged, or be considered a legitimate option. \n(Response 35) FDA disagrees with the \nrecommendations to permit or encourage the use of alphanumeric subcategories instead of the assessment statement \u2018\u2018Suspicious.\u2019\u2019 All the required assessment statements under the MQSA quality standards are words or phrases, not numbers. Thus, the assessment statements are not identical to the numerical codes derived from ACR\u2019s Breast Imaging\u2014Reporting and Data System (BI\u2013RADS) (Refs. 26 and 27). BI\u2013RADS is a practice guideline published by a professional society (the \nACR), and is not associated with the MQSA quality standard requirements. While a numeric or alphanumeric BI\u2013 RADS assessment code in addition to the assessment statement may be used, one of the overall final assessment of findings statements as described in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) of this final rule must appear in the report. \nFor example, in BI\u2013RADS, category 4 \n(Suspicious) offers optional subcategories a through c, and phrases associated with each letter (4a: \u2018\u2018Low suspicion for malignancy,\u2019\u2019 4b: \u2018\u2018Moderate suspicion for malignancy,\u2019\u2019 and 4c: \u2018\u2018High suspicion for malignancy\u2019\u2019), to further refine the level of suspicion (Ref. 28). However, for any \nmammogram that would receive an ACR BI\u2013RADS code of either 4, 4a, 4b, or 4c, the assessment statement required under the MQSA quality standards is not a number or a letter, but the word \u2018\u2018Suspicious.\u2019\u2019 Additionally, the phrase associated with each ACR BI\u2013RADS code 4a through 4c is not an approved alternative standard for use as an assessment statement; while the final rule does not prohibit such a statement from being included in the report, the overall final assessment statement, \u2018\u2018Suspicious,\u2019\u2019 would be the appropriate statement to include as the final assessment category of the mammogram (Ref. 29). \n(Comment 36) A comment \nrecommends that FDA provide examples of when referral of a self- referred patient to a healthcare provider is mammographically indicated. \n(Response 36) The proposed \n\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(ii) stated that \u2018\u2018Each facility that accepts patients who do not have a healthcare provider shall maintain a system for referring such patients to a healthcare provider when mammographically or clinically indicated.\u2019\u2019 FDA believes that such referral is indicated when the mammographic findings warrant followup imaging or intervention sooner than at a routine screening interval.

The facility is required to send the patient a summary of the mammography report written in lay terms (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) in this final rule). This final rule adds breast density notification language to the lay summary requirement, but it does not require that the lay summary mention patient symptoms or individual mammographic findings. FDA does not \nbelieve that it is appropriate to require specific language for the wide range of breast symptoms and mammographic findings that may be identified. For example, some of the items mentioned in the comment, such as pain and discharge, cannot be identified on a mammogram. The regulations require that the mammography report to the provider address findings, clinical questions raised by the referring healthcare provider, and recommendations for additional actions, if any, (see \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) and (vii) in this final rule). Some findings or symptoms may be present but not clinically significant. The referring healthcare provider, who receives the mammography report and is also familiar with the patient\u2019s history and physical findings, is best positioned to discuss the case with the patient. \n(Comment 38) Several comments \naddress the proposed final assessment category \u2018\u2018Post Procedure Mammograms for Marker Placement.\u2019\u2019 A comment asserts that the addition of an assessment category for a post- procedure mammogram is unnecessary. Another comment asserts that the post- procedure mammogram is \u2018\u2018bundled into\u2019\u2019 the interventional procedure and does not receive an assessment. A comment requests clarification on whether a mammogram documenting a biopsy clip or marker requires documentation. \n(Response 38) The assessment \nstatement \u2018\u2018Post Procedure Mammograms for Marker Placement\u2019\u2019 was approved as alternative standard #12 on September 17, 2003 (Ref. 24), under the mechanism described in current \u00a7 900.18 for the approval of alternatives to the MQSA quality standards in \u00a7 900.12. Since its approval in 2003, it has been available and acceptable for use as a final assessment statement. In this final rule, \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(G), FDA is adding the nearly identical assessment statement \u2018\u2018Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement\u2019\u2019 to the implementing regulations. The situations in which this assessment should be given to any particular mammogram are more appropriate for the IP to determine in the course of clinical decision-making.

The availability of a post-procedure assessment category also helps maintain the accuracy of the medical outcomes audit required under \u00a7 900.12(f). The audit requires followup for positive mammograms, defined in existing \u00a7 900.2(mm) as mammograms receiving assessments of either \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,\u2019\u2019 but a post-procedure mammogram of a patient with a previously identified abnormality is not intended to be counted as a new positive result; this assessment category helps facilities to distinguish and exclude post-procedure mammograms from the audit. \n(Comment 39) Two comments object \nto FDA\u2019s mention of a \u2018\u2018localization needle\u2019\u2019 in the explanation of one potential use for this \u2018\u2018Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement\u2019\u2019 final assessment, since spatial localization may not always be performed with a needle, and recommends revising this explanation to \u2018\u2018localization device\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018localization marker.\u2019\u2019 Another comment asserts that a marker may not always deploy and recommends changing the wording of the assessment statement to \u2018\u2018Post procedure mammogram.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 39) FDA agrees that some \nlocalization devices are not needles, and is clarifying our explanation of the assessment category as follows: this category is primarily used for a mammogram performed following a biopsy to confirm the deployment and position of a breast tissue marker. The other use of this final assessment category is for a mammogram performed to document the position of a localization needle or other marker. During preoperative localization, a needle or other temporary marker may be positioned to direct subsequent surgery for a nonpalpable lesion seen on earlier mammography. The post- procedure mammogram is performed as a guide to identify the suspicious site for the surgeon who will biopsy or excise the lesion and remove the needle or marker. The post-procedure mammogram is \ntypically performed in an attempt to \nlocalize a device, such as a needle or other tissue marker, or to determine whether the device has deployed. FDA concludes that this intention is accurately captured by the phrasing \u2018\u2018Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement,\u2019\u2019 even in cases in which the mammogram reveals that a marker failed to deploy. FDA notes that all mammographic views obtained in a single examination are typically referred to collectively as a \u2018\u2018mammogram,\u2019\u2019 and therefore agrees in part with the comment that recommends changing the wording of the assessment statement to the singular \u2018\u2018Post procedure mammogram.\u2019\u2019 Accordingly, we are revising the wording of the assessment statement to the singular \u2018\u2018Post- Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(G) in this final rule), in addition to clarifying the description as noted. \n(Comment 40) One comment asserts \nthat a lay-language summary to the patient should not be required for a mammogram performed for marker placement, because the mammogram is performed for localization rather than for diagnosis, and receiving a lay summary of such an examination may confuse the patient. \n(Response 40) As discussed in \nResponse 38, we have explained that if a facility makes the post-procedure mammogram a separately logged or charged examination rather than part of the interventional procedure, the mammogram is subject to all MQSA quality standard requirements, including a report to the referring healthcare provider and a summary of the report in lay language to the patient. The lay summary must be specific to the examination and report; for example, if the assessment statement in a report states that an examination was a post- procedure mammogram for marker placement, then the lay summary of that report should likewise mention the procedure or the marker placement, but it would not be appropriate to state that the mammogram results were abnormal, worrisome, suspicious for cancer, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd525a37-681f-4f75-a44f-baf1cef21223": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd525a37-681f-4f75-a44f-baf1cef21223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffc6daf9-06e2-48c6-b359-dfb362694c7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "e970fc87f744a7a931046ac387ee491e6495dbd5f616a6eaf5f69dfcf481cf6d"}, "2": {"node_id": "04317d59-9c7a-42ff-a2ce-652b4805cd7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "c6749be64347a59e7d3132b9b3a8fa761383fae07cbad38f4951aacdd397db57"}}, "hash": "4dda06a8e1cf6fddf744b97a2902f96442cdfbea6a962e9673d20e07952dfc54", "text": "FDA believes that a lay summary limited to discussing the fact that the mammogram was performed for \nlocalization after a procedure will not confuse a patient who has just undergone a procedure. \n(Comment 41) Several comments \nrecommend that FDA revise the assessment statement \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison\u2019\u2019 (proposed \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(v)(B)) to replace \u2018\u2018mammograms\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018breast imaging\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018breast examinations,\u2019\u2019 to include \nother imaging modalities such as breast ultrasound. \n(Response 41) FDA disagrees with this \nrecommendation.

As addressed in Response 4, the MQSA and FDA\u2019s implementing regulations apply specifically to mammography facilities, so facilities where a patient\u2019s prior mammograms were performed would have retained those examinations, pursuant to the MQSA record retention requirement (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) in this final rule), and would presumably respond to the patient\u2019s request to transfer them or release copies of their records, pursuant to the MQSA record release requirements (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii) in this final rule). In contrast, other imaging centers not subject to the MQSA quality standards are not required to release prior non-mammography imaging within these regulatory deadlines. Additionally, other imaging modalities may not provide the type of information that is directly comparable to the mammogram. \n(Comment 42) A comment requests \nconfirmation that an Incomplete assessment statement, which the commenter cites as \u2018\u2018Category 0: Incomplete\u2014need additional imaging evaluation and/or comparison with prior examination(s),\u2019\u2019 remains acceptable. Similarly, another comment recommends that FDA allow facilities to choose whether to separate the two Incomplete assessment categories or to keep them grouped together. \n(Response 42) The first commenter\u2019s \ncitation of the assessment statement is incorrect on two points. As we noted in Response 35, all approved assessment statements under the MQSA quality standards are words or phrases, not numeric or alphanumeric codes, so the numeral zero is not required as part of the assessment. Also, the Incomplete assessment statement approved by FDA \nin 2003 as alternative standard #11 does not refer to \u2018\u2018prior examinations,\u2019\u2019 but to \u2018\u2018prior mammograms.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, the phrasing cited by the first commenter is not acceptable. However, we note that even after the introduction of the two Incomplete assessment statements in this final rule, alternative standard #11 remains in effect, such that the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dc1c41d-8a6f-4cfb-8bf5-c22704e5ec7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dc1c41d-8a6f-4cfb-8bf5-c22704e5ec7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "196767d1-a91a-435c-a263-4fb9f2c5101c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "bc5a4052aca955faac363bc411324844ce75999498fbf98e7a8a6d472af44b4c"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd459eff-1314-4976-bf19-4b6157759cf3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "c50e727b12ee4b7ebbe129d327075dc7ed90186e195d758d62cbc718af919a16"}}, "hash": "3138a864427a9961febff85b9946620a809ab1c208bae1761465200f502c3727", "text": "15140 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \ncombined assessment statement \n\u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation and/or prior mammograms for comparison\u2019\u2019 may also be used. Therefore, FDA agrees with the second commenter that a facility may choose either to use one of the separate Incomplete assessment statements that appear in this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(v)(A) and (B)), or to use the combined statement as found in alternative standard #11, which remains an approved alternative standard. \n(Comment 43) A comment \nrecommends that FDA expand and clarify its justification of the assessment category \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison\u2019\u2019 with a more evidence-based justification addressing the value of the comparison of a mammogram with prior mammograms. The proposed rule (under section V.E.3 of the Supplemental Materials) includes the statement, \u2018\u2018Comparison to previous examinations is sometimes required to make a final assessment.\u2019\u2019 However, the comment recommends that FDA instead justify the value of comparison mammograms by using the statement, \u2018\u2018Evidence shows that comparison with a single prior exam, and more so with multiple prior examinations, improves accuracy, including a reduction in the recall rate and an improvement in sensitivity and predictive value.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 43) The reference cited by \nthe commenter (Ref. 30) demonstrates that comparison to two or more prior exams reduces the recall rate, and increases the cancer detection rate and a positive predictive value (PPV) known as PPV1. Although comparison to previous examinations is valuable, FDA does not believe that the recommended statement is fully supported by the cited reference. However, FDA agrees with the commenter\u2019s broader implication that there are many benefits to interpreting a mammogram in comparison to one or more of the patient\u2019s previous mammograms, including but not limited to improved accuracy and reduced recall rate. FDA believes that the final rule adequately reflects the value of making comparisons to previous mammograms when available. \n(Comment 44) Some comments \nexpress concern about the timing of \ninterpretation of a mammogram following an assessment of \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison.\u2019\u2019 A comment asserts that a patient may not be able to obtain prior mammograms within 30 days, and another comment asserts that the rule would permit a total of 60 days from the performance of the examination to the final interpretation, assuming 30 days to obtain the prior examination and another 30 days to make the comparison and issue a final report, and that during that time the patient\u2019s insurance or healthcare provider may change. One of the commenters recommends that FDA impose a total limit of 30 days from the performance of the examination to the issuance of the final report, and one recommends that FDA monitor the use and benefit of the new assessment category. \n(Response 44) A facility is required to \nissue a report to the referring healthcare provider and a summary in lay terms to the patient no later than 30 days after the examination (\u00a7 900.12(c)(3)(i)), and to issue a followup report no later than 30 days after issuing an initial report of \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison,\u2019\u2019 whether or not comparison views can be obtained (\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(v)(B) in this final rule). However, we note that these 30-day intervals are maximums, and represent baseline standards. There is no requirement that a facility wait a full 30 days for a patient to submit prior images, and likewise no requirement that a facility wait a full 30 days after receiving a prior comparison examination before issuing a final report. A facility may establish policies regarding a shorter interval to wait for prior examinations and a shorter interval in which to issue a final report after receiving comparison examinations, perhaps with exceptions for a patient\u2019s individual situation. Therefore, FDA concludes that the reporting deadlines stated in the regulations as proposed and finalized are adequate. FDA also notes that although the two \u2018\u2018Incomplete\u2019\u2019 assessment statements are new to the quality standards regulations, they are derived from the \u2018\u2018Incomplete\u2019\u2019 assessment statement approved in alternative standard #11 in 2003 (Ref. 25) and in widespread use since that time.

First, as noted in Response 44, this assessment statement is derived from one that has already been eligible for use since 2003 under the approved alternative standard #11 (Ref. 25). Furthermore, in this final rule, use of the assessment statement \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 900.12(c)(v)(B) also requires that \u2018\u2018a followup report with an assessment category identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (E) of this section must be issued within 30 calendar days of the initial report whether or not comparison views can be obtained.\u2019\u2019 Thus, the imperative to issue a final assessment for the examination within 30 days is directly linked to the initial use of this incomplete assessment category. As noted, since the time that alternative standard #11 was approved in 2003, FDA has not become aware of any concerns raised about the timing or issuance of the final report. \nH. Deadlines for Mammography Reports \n(Comment 46) A comment \nrecommends that the report to the \nhealthcare provider and the lay summary to the patient should have the same deadline of 14 days. A separate comment recommends that screening mammograms should have a deadline for reports and lay summaries of 30 days from the date of the examination. Another comment recommends that when prior mammograms are needed for comparison, the report should have a deadline of 14 days and the lay summary a deadline of 21 days, respectively, from the receipt of the prior mammogram, not from the date of the current examination. \n(Response 46) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. The deadline of 30 days from the date of the examination (or from the date of the initial \nIncomplete report, if applicable) is a maximum and a baseline standard. As noted in Response 44, facilities may choose to establish policies of shorter deadlines for releasing prior examinations and for performing comparisons to prior examinations. FDA concludes that the deadline stated in this final rule is adequate. Aside from the specific audit provisions in \u00a7 900.12(f), the MQSA and FDA\u2019s implementing regulations do not distinguish between mammograms whose clinical role is screening or diagnosis. All examinations must meet the reporting deadlines, and the commenter\u2019s recommendation of a 30- day deadline is generally consistent with the regulations.

Accordingly, in this final rule we are revising \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) by deleting the words \u2018\u2018but in no case later than 21 calendar days from the date of the mammographic examination,\u2019\u2019 and revising \u00a7 900.12(c)(3)(ii) by deleting the words \u2018\u2018but in no case later than 14 calendar days from the date of the mammographic examination.\u2019\u2019 All reports and lay summaries, regardless of the assessment of the mammogram, must be sent within 30 calendar days of the examination (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) and (3)(ii) in this final rule). However, as noted in Response 46, this 30-day deadline is a maximum and a baseline standard. In many facilities, the interpretation and communication of the results is typically performed much sooner than at 30 days. Accordingly, we consider the within-30-day timeframe of the mammographic examination to be appropriate, except in the following circumstances: We require that, for positive mammograms (defined as mammograms with an assessment category of either suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (see \u00a7 900.2(mm)), the facility send both the report and the lay summary within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the mammogram. For these situations, the deadline for providing the lay summary is earlier than the general 30-day deadline from the date of the mammographic examination for all reports and lay summaries (see \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) in this final rule). As discussed in the proposed rule (84 FR 11676), FDA believes such action \nby the facility is appropriate for these two final assessment categories because they both indicate findings that warrant \nfurther evaluation. \nWe have noted an additional \ninconsistency, regarding the deadlines for sending a report to a \u2018\u2018self-referred\u2019\u2019 patient who has not identified a referring healthcare provider. A self- referred patient receives both the lay summary and the mammography report. As discussed above (in this response), the timeframe for sending the lay summary to any patient, including a self-referred patient, is within 30 days of the performance of the examination, and within 7 days of interpretation if the assessment is \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) in this final rule). The timeframe for sending the report to the self-referred patient is within 30 days of the examination (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(i) in this final rule), but the proposed rule did not specify any change in that deadline when the results are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. We are now adding the statement \u2018\u2018If the assessment of the mammography report is \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,\u2019\u2019 the facility shall send this report to the patient within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the mammograms\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(i) in this final rule). This addition makes the 30-day and 7-day deadlines consistent for sending the mammography report to either the referring provider (if a patient identifies a provider) or directly to a patient who has not identified a provider.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "021f10aa-1c2b-4861-b9b7-3fdf5f24c6a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "021f10aa-1c2b-4861-b9b7-3fdf5f24c6a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5378467-dcf0-4f87-a98f-653525d3fedd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "e826cb9e03083ab001d0a6a0d2c5dbcc9180b0fe3966d53dbe0762d32f2eb534"}, "2": {"node_id": "274b364e-913b-41ea-92ff-1b8e92b2ab1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "c780b8d99a7fba38ac878fe50c8afe10259438150b97f8ad77d4632641422fe9"}}, "hash": "ea69710a3b7da399ae6f8db215a9bdee9bde438dcca4cad6b882d75b6e0f738c", "text": "I. Breast Density Notification\u2014General \nSupport for Density Notification \n(Comment 48) FDA received \ncomments that support the proposed requirements to provide information regarding breast density to both patients and their healthcare providers, with comments recommending that FDA \nfinalize the regulations with the two categories of breast density in patient lay summaries and four categories in reports to healthcare providers as proposed. \n(Response 48) FDA appreciates the \npublic support for the density notification requirement. FDA believes that receiving consistent baseline information regarding breast density is important for both patients and their healthcare providers to make informed shared decisions, and that the respective requirements for the report and lay summary strike an appropriate balance between providing sufficient information to healthcare providers while maintaining a clear message to patients. Therefore, in this final rule, FDA is requiring that the breast density notification use two categories of breast density in the lay summary to patients (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)) and four categories in the report to healthcare providers (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) through (D)). \n(Comment 49) A comment states that \nthe proposed rule creates a standard that is not backed by medical evidence. \n(Response 49) FDA disagrees with this \ncomment. The commenter is referring to the requirement for breast density notification. Both the proposed amendments and this final rule do not specify the further management of patients with dense tissue, only that these patients and their providers must be notified of their breast density. As discussed in Response 62, the Agency is revising the notification to patients with dense breast tissue to reflect that \u2018\u2018In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers.\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv) in this final rule), which is supported by many scientific studies demonstrating increased cancer detection in dense breasts using supplemental imaging modalities (Refs. 10, 11, 31, and 32). This increased detection facilitates earlier treatment of mammographically occult cancers, and may reduce morbidity from the tumor and its treatment. \n(Comment 50) Several comments \nrecommend that the lay summary should contain simple, clear language, and several comments recommend that the density information should be placed at the top of the letter instead of following the result or assessment statement. \n(Response 50) FDA agrees with the \nrecommendation that the lay summary should contain clear language. In this final rule, both of the revised notification statements for the lay summary are below the eighth grade reading level on the Flesch-Kincaid scale. We conclude that the notification language represents a balance of understandability and accuracy (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) in this final rule). However, the Agency does not agree that it is necessary to require that the breast density notification statement be placed in a specific location relative to other mammogram result information in the lay summary. We incidentally note that the lay summary is not required to include an assessment category or statement. Furthermore, given the range of mammogram results and recommendations that may need to be communicated by a facility to a patient, we conclude that it may be unduly restrictive to make this a requirement for facilities, and that it \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f82c6b1c-6dc9-428b-8414-ec1e38d6b742": {"__data__": {"id_": "f82c6b1c-6dc9-428b-8414-ec1e38d6b742", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e81ab4d8-57a4-4092-a7d6-324ce06bae28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6ea557a53a510dd718ba2869e4b83933db5f7d644f450c3d3bebcac549ebd05e"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f3a1c2e-9f05-408f-94c5-74c88e6a9468", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "172e44cceb38bce49c932a0017e0202d5f62a28ba3407db8420162157e4218f7"}}, "hash": "5c12f1084eb876d14bf5fa0ac3b52af2250e3e3068579b1f0f854d56a78edd79", "text": "15142 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nmay potentially be confusing to \npatients. \n(Comment 51) A comment \nrecommends that an explanation of medical terms must be included in all lay summaries. \n(Response 51) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment.

The requirements for the lay summary represent baseline standards; FDA recognizes that facilities may choose to provide additional information or explanation they feel is needed by their patients. The breast density notification language in this final rule is meant to be concise and clear, and adding visual aids and medical cartoons into the lay summary may potentially distract from the primary message regarding a patient\u2019s breast density and resulting recommendations. FDA notes that the interaction between a patient and their healthcare provider presents an appropriate opportunity to address questions that a patient may have regarding the lay summary. The required language in this final rule (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)) includes such a recommendation to talk to a healthcare provider. \n(Comment 55) Several comments \nrecommend that in addition to the breast density notification, FDA add patient education and a clear plan of management to the lay summary. \n(Response 55) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. We conclude that the language in this final rule provides a foundation for patients to be informed regarding their breast density when using mammography. The intent of the lay summary being required and provided to the patient is not to serve as an exhaustive resource regarding breast disease and its management. The lay summary includes the recommendation for the patient to talk to their healthcare provider, and we note that this interaction is an appropriate opportunity for additional patient education. Regarding the recommendation that the lay summary include a clear plan of management, FDA notes that the lay summary is generated by the breast imaging facility, whereas the plan of clinical management for each individual patient will be developed by the patient and their healthcare provider, and as such, it is not appropriate for this type of information to be included in the lay summary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f3a1c2e-9f05-408f-94c5-74c88e6a9468": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f3a1c2e-9f05-408f-94c5-74c88e6a9468", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e81ab4d8-57a4-4092-a7d6-324ce06bae28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6ea557a53a510dd718ba2869e4b83933db5f7d644f450c3d3bebcac549ebd05e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f82c6b1c-6dc9-428b-8414-ec1e38d6b742", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "5c12f1084eb876d14bf5fa0ac3b52af2250e3e3068579b1f0f854d56a78edd79"}}, "hash": "172e44cceb38bce49c932a0017e0202d5f62a28ba3407db8420162157e4218f7", "text": "(Comment 56) A comment \nrecommends replacing the phrase, \u2018\u2018The breasts are almost entirely fatty,\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A), with the phrase, \u2018\u2018The breast tissue is of low density,\u2019\u2019 asserting that the former statement has \u2018\u2018negative connotations\u2019\u2019 to many \npatients. \n(Response 56) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. FDA notes that this category, and the others in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) through (D), are already in widespread use in breast density reporting.

Self-referred patients will receive the lay summary as well as the report, which should help mitigate any unintended negative connotations of the report. \n(Comment 57) A comment questions \nthe benefit of the density notification and recommends that FDA should involve more individuals in the drafting of density notification language, and that this language should describe the limitations of density assessment, the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment such as gadolinium exposure from MRI and radiation exposure from additional mammographic evaluation, and the lack of benefit of density notification. A comment recommends adding additional language educating patients about breast density, what it means to a patient, and how patients can take extra steps to protect themselves. \n(Response 57) FDA disagrees with the \nassertion of lack of benefit in informing patients and their healthcare providers of a patient\u2019s breast density. FDA considers it to be a benefit to inform patients about their breast anatomy. In addition, FDA considers it to be a benefit to inform patients in a consistent manner about their breast density. The language in the final rule is intended as a baseline for breast density information, which can be used by patients and their healthcare providers \nto help inform and guide patient care. FDA notes that the provider-patient interaction is an appropriate opportunity for further discussion of breast density and of the benefits and risks of possible further evaluation.

Another comment recommends that patients should be directed to additional information on breast density, not just to their referring physician. \n(Response 58) The Agency believes it \nis important for patients to have an understanding of their breast density to promote informed and shared decision making about whether supplemental screening is appropriate based on each patient\u2019s individual circumstances, and speaking with their healthcare provider is an additional opportunity to accomplish this. The final rule does not prohibit facilities or healthcare providers from providing additional information on breast density to patients; however, FDA concludes that specific additional resources on breast density should not be codified in the final rule as a requirement to be provided as part of the lay summary, particularly since these sources of information may change or become outdated. \n(Comment 59) A comment asserts that \nthere are conflicting reports of the density discussion at the 2011 NMQAAC meeting. \n(Response 59) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. A transcript of the 2011 NMQAAC meeting is available (Ref. 33). The transcript shows there was general agreement on requiring density notification and advising patients to speak with their healthcare providers. In 2011, there was some disagreement among the members of the Committee on particular issues such as the \ndefinition of a dense breast, the degree of cancer risk conferred by dense breast tissue, and recommendations for further evaluation of patients with dense breasts. FDA notes that since 2011 there is now greater consensus in the scientific and medical practice community on the categorization of breast density and the degree of risk it confers, and also greater availability of imaging modalities for supplemental screening (Ref. 31). This final rule only recommends that patients speak with their providers, and does not make any specific recommendations for further imaging or other evaluation, which is more appropriately reserved for the \nunique clinical decision-making process that takes place between a patient and their provider. \n(Comment 60) A comment \nrecommends that there be four different patient notification statements in the lay summary rather than two. A comment recommends adding detailed explanatory information regarding breasts as \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018not dense,\u2019\u2019 or adding a four-category patient density notification. \n(Response 60) FDA concludes that the \ntwo patient notification statements (i.e., informing patients that they have \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 breast tissue or \u2018\u2018not dense\u2019\u2019 breast tissue) provide a clear message to patients regarding their breast density, and that generating four different categories, each with unique language in the lay summary, would potentially add confusion for some patients, as well as an increased burden on facilities. FDA concludes that the language in this final rule for the lay summaries (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)) provides an adequate baseline for breast density notification to patients given that the purpose of the letter is not to serve as a complete resource for breast density information and, further, that the inclusion of more detailed information might detract from the actual notification, including by dissuading patients from reading the notice at all, given its length. \n(Comment 61) A comment asserts that \nthere is variability and limited reproducibility in the determination of dense versus non-dense breasts, and that if this variation is expressed as changing assessments, women may lose confidence in the screening mammography process. \n(Response 61) FDA acknowledges that \nfor some patients there may be some degree of variability in the determination of breast density due to interobserver and intra-observer variability. FDA notes that there have been advancements in technology (e.g., density classification software devices) \nthat may help mitigate such variability in assessment. In addition, we conclude that potential variability in density assessment does not outweigh the importance of communicating breast density to patients and their healthcare providers. FDA disagrees with the comment that patients will lose confidence in mammography if their breast density assessment changes.

Some patients with dense breast tissue and other risk factors may be advised by their providers (based on their individual risk factors) to undergo supplemental screening, such as with ultrasound, which has been shown to increase cancer detection, particularly of small and node-negative cancers (Ref. 32); this early detection may decrease morbidity from the cancers and their treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96a87d2d-e65c-4871-9c5c-2ca2a97e602b": {"__data__": {"id_": "96a87d2d-e65c-4871-9c5c-2ca2a97e602b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "911a1166-940d-465d-89e3-96e1974f6453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "cd382d5484bb812b24c694b39df2ef289450b9a4032d9ffba590b754d84c3317"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b2e0aa0-8378-4d5d-9a5e-2b84f4a4f862", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "6e0c60eecbdbe0d6eb88cab1e1a423530bf6719e8133c2301ce04065eda28e61"}}, "hash": "f6ea0a6ccb4b564d8cbfa4460679a2aa72170a4d39cfd4cdfd808f986c7db4d2", "text": "32); this early detection may decrease morbidity from the cancers and their treatment. \n(Comment 70) A comment \nrecommends that FDA should support development of an evidence base and guidelines for care for women with dense breasts, which can then be used to develop and provide educational materials to clinical providers in providing evidence-based supplemental screening recommendations. \n(Response 70) FDA disagrees with the \ncomment. There are many existing resources, including recommendations from professional societies and a large base of literature, that already provide recommendations on care for patients with dense breasts (including, but not limited to Refs. 10, 12 to 14, 28, 31, and 33 to 37).

The Agency believes that it is important to communicate information regarding breast density to patients in all density categories. FDA concludes that the language in this final rule for the lay summary for patients who have non-dense breasts (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii)) is of an appropriate level of detail and provides context for the breast density notification. \n(Comment 72) A comment asserts that \nthe way that risk is described by statisticians and epidemiologists, for example by comparing the risk of breast cancer between women whose breast tissue is at the extremes of greatest and least density, is misleading to the average lay person. \n(Response 72) FDA notes that the \nlanguage in this final rule for breast density notification in the lay summary does not communicate risk information to patients in the manner in which the commenter asserts risk information is described by statisticians or \nepidemiologists.

FDA does not agree that it is appropriate to require the lay summary to include a discussion of all possible breast imaging modalities that may be more effective for some patients than mammography, as this would require a significant amount of information that may be difficult for patients to interpret. We believe that it is more appropriate for the healthcare provider to discuss this information with the patient and engage in shared clinical decision- making based on the patient\u2019s individual circumstances. This rule does not prohibit a facility from providing further information to patients in addition to the required language in the final rule if the facility chooses to do so. \nJ. Breast Density Notification Language \n(Comment 74) Several comments \nrecommend deleting the phrase \u2018\u2018more \nglands than fat in the breasts\u2019\u2019 from \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii), asserting that it is inaccurate because: (1) the ratio of fat to glandular tissue is not always related to density on mammography due to regional variation of fat and glandular tissue as well as a fibrous tissue component; (2) fibrous tissue is distinct from glandular tissue and often accounts for the majority of the density seen on mammograms; and (3) dense breasts have more fat than dense tissue when quantified. Another comment asserts that the breast density depends upon other factors, such as the glandular tissue and stroma projecting together, the compliance of the breast under pressure of the compression paddle and the amount of fat in the macroscopic component of stroma. \n(Response 74) FDA acknowledges the \npresence of fibrous stroma in the composition of the breast, and agrees \nwith the comments regarding the many anatomic, technical, and other factors that contribute to mammographic breast density. We also agree with the recommended deletion. Accordingly, we have deleted the phrase \u2018\u2018more glands than fat in the breasts\u2019\u2019 from the density notifications in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this final rule. Additionally, this final rule does not use the term \u2018\u2018glandular tissue\u2019\u2019 in either the assessment of breast tissue density in the report to the healthcare provider (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) through (D)) or the notification of density in the lay summary to the patient (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)). \n(Comment 75) Several comments \nrecommend modifying the language in the patient lay summary in proposed \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv) to include a statement \nthat higher breast density raises a patient\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer. \n(Response 75) FDA agrees with the \ncomments, and notes that studies show that women with dense breast tissue do have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer (Refs. 12 to 15). Accordingly, we have added to the patient notification language in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this final rule, a statement that \u2018\u2018Dense tissue . . . raises the risk of developing breast cancer.\u2019\u2019 \n(Comment 76) Several comments \nrecommend that FDA adopt the density notification language proposed by two commenters. This language includes: (1) a revision of FDA\u2019s proposed introductory sentences beginning with \u2018\u2018Some patients,\u2019\u2019 out of concern that they will cause alarm to patients with non-dense breasts and confusion to patients with dense breasts; (2) a recommendation to include an elective option to use four density categories in States whose notification regulations require this; (3) a recommendation to substitute the term \u2018\u2018scattered fibroglandular tissue\u2019\u2019 for the term \u2018\u2018scattered areas of fibroglandular density\u2019\u2019 in the mammography report, to avoid patient confusion of the phrase \u2018\u2018scattered . . . density\u2019\u2019 with tissue that is \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019; (4) a recommendation that patients with non-dense breasts should not be advised to speak to their provider; (5) a recommendation that patients be advised to continue routine screening mammography; and (6) a recommendation to add a statement that risk factors such as density can change. \n(Response 76) FDA appreciates these \ncomments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4400cd47-705a-4427-83aa-8ac335f7802a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4400cd47-705a-4427-83aa-8ac335f7802a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39ff2eee-9ae4-4c1e-afa4-ab04ecb9fc91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "97278c23e84891f240891bc59f3feb8adc75218ed87a6ff0c25b31a3b3c68d10"}, "2": {"node_id": "567b8bc1-697d-4d15-a98e-38f198801d61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "1c6c0809ce0cef1e9cdfb9a55def0e96b10edecbb50203d929a9a7a67797152d"}}, "hash": "54e4792da1c81a44f8ceb843a555e7e4f593a1d69620fdaba22c9c29ffd866f4", "text": "(Response 76) FDA appreciates these \ncomments. As described in the \nfollowing and organized according to the numbered topics identified in Comment 76, we are revising some of the wording in the final rule for the lay summary. \n(1) We have modified the introductory \nlanguage to remove the reference to \u2018\u2018Some patients,\u2019\u2019 but we disagree with the assertion that providing some basic information about density will cause alarm to patients with non-dense breast tissue or confusion to patients with dense breast tissue. \n(2) As addressed in Responses 68 and \n79, we have retained the two categories of density, but changed the wording from the comparative terms \u2018\u2018high density\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018low density\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not dense,\u2019\u2019 in order to provide a clear message to the patient. We have also corrected \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) to specify that the lay summary shall include \u2018\u2018an assessment of breast density as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section\u2019\u2019 (i.e., the two \ncategories of \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not dense\u2019\u2019). \nIn States where notification using four density categories is required by State law, facilities may also provide that information to patients, but this is distinct from the notification paragraph required by this MQSA final rule. \n(3) As the commenter notes, the \nphrase \u2018\u2018scattered areas of fibroglandular density\u2019\u2019 is only required in the report intended for the healthcare provider, where this phrase conforms to current clinical practice and should not cause confusion to healthcare providers. One of the goals of the MQSA and its implementing regulations is ensuring clear communication between the IP and the referring provider; therefore, the report is written using medical terminology. The phrase is not required in the lay summary to the patient; therefore, we do not agree that the phrase will cause patient confusion. For all patients, whether referred by a provider or self-referred, the lay summary will only contain a clear statement that the patient\u2019s breast tissue is \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018not dense.\u2019\u2019 Patients who are self-referred will also receive the report, but the lay summary should help avoid confusion. Even a patient who is self-referred for a mammogram may give the report to their healthcare provider; therefore, the precision of the report should not be sacrificed in order to tailor the language to the lay patient, who will also receive a lay summary. \n(4) Regarding the commenter\u2019s \nrecommendation that FDA should remove the advice for patients whose tissue is assessed as \u2018\u2018not dense\u2019\u2019 to discuss breast density with a healthcare \nprovider, FDA disagrees with this recommendation, as we believe that this conversation is appropriate for patients in all density categories. \n(5) In response to the \nrecommendation to add a statement instructing patients to continue routine screening mammograms, we believe that is part of a larger discussion, including regarding screening methods and time intervals, that should take place between a patient and the patient\u2019s healthcare provider. \n(6) In response to the \nrecommendation to add a statement that breast density and other risk factors can change, FDA concludes that adding this statement in the lay summary may be confusing and may detract from the information provided regarding the current assessment of the patient\u2019s breast density. \n(Comment 77) Several comments \nrecommend that not all women should be informed of breast density risks, and that notifying all women is ineffective \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c32f639-4bee-4839-943f-6427f8d5a110": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c32f639-4bee-4839-943f-6427f8d5a110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de56fb82-8755-44e2-bc6e-90e23caf5b69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "8d9470754597b998d516ee2c697d0ac7bb173688c9834033a3013623f74caedd"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f267bec-11b9-4f0f-a555-859dc618c79a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "2c8b603cb994d7e86eb37b815961786ba49c7be2570ba59c84f0a0b95698debe"}}, "hash": "9c077fe01e0c9e5f90d1ca9b21745ae6185d037464a020350cdc1decd6e02fc8", "text": "15146 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nand doing so may cause confusion. \nAnother comment recommends that breast density language should only be included in lay summaries to women with dense breast tissue. \n(Response 77) FDA disagrees with the \ncomments.

Therefore, as noted in Response 76, FDA believes that it is appropriate for patients in all density categories to discuss breast density with their healthcare providers. The intent of this final rule is to provide breast density information to all patients and their healthcare providers to help guide each patient\u2019s care. \n(Comment 78) A comment \nrecommends that patients should be encouraged to discuss their mammography findings with their physician to determine what additional tests may be beneficial in their specific circumstances. \n(Response 78) FDA agrees with the \ncomment, and concludes that the \ncurrent wording in the final rule, \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), accomplishes this. \n(Comment 79) Several comments \nrecommend using the terms \u2018\u2018dense\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not dense\u2019\u2019 rather than \u2018\u2018high density\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018low density.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 79) FDA agrees with this \nrecommendation to improve clarity and reflect clinical practice.

One of the intents of this rulemaking is to ensure that patients receive a consistent baseline of information regarding their breast density; additionally, the notification should be subject to straightforward verification during the MQSA inspection. Therefore, the Agency is not providing alternative breast density reporting language aside from that which is included in the final rule, nor changing the notification requirement from a required paragraph to a list of key points. FDA recognizes that individual States as well as facilities may choose to provide patients with additional information, beyond the information required in this final rule, \nwhere it does not conflict with the MQSA and its implementing regulations. \n(Comment 81) A comment \nrecommends that FDA be cautious in the use of the word \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 when referring to women with dense breasts, since dense breasts may be pathologic and should be a subject of research for disease prevention. Conversely, several comments recommend that lay summaries should state that dense breasts are not abnormal. \n(Response 81) FDA agrees that it is \nnot necessary to characterize dense breast tissue as normal or abnormal, but rather to focus on communicating whether a patient has breast tissue that is dense or not dense. In this final rule, FDA does not use the words \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018abnormal\u2019\u2019 in the breast density notification statements for patients with either dense or non-dense breast tissue. \n(Comment 82) A comment \nrecommends that the lay summary should emphasize that dense breasts are common and that most women with dense breasts do not reach the clinical threshold for having an elevated risk for breast cancer. \n(Response 82) FDA agrees that dense \nbreast tissue is common; however, we disagree with the comment regarding elevated risk of cancer. We note that studies show that women with dense breast tissue do have an elevated risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer (Refs. 12 to 15), and as noted in Response 75, we are revising the patient notification language (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) in this final rule) to include a statement that dense tissue raises the risk of developing breast cancer. \n(Comment 83) A comment \nrecommends that FDA include recommendations to use FDA-cleared automated breast density assessment devices, and that instead of the four categories of breast density proposed for the report to the healthcare provider, breast density should be reported along a continuum based on such automated breast density devices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f267bec-11b9-4f0f-a555-859dc618c79a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f267bec-11b9-4f0f-a555-859dc618c79a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de56fb82-8755-44e2-bc6e-90e23caf5b69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "8d9470754597b998d516ee2c697d0ac7bb173688c9834033a3013623f74caedd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c32f639-4bee-4839-943f-6427f8d5a110", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "9c077fe01e0c9e5f90d1ca9b21745ae6185d037464a020350cdc1decd6e02fc8"}}, "hash": "2c8b603cb994d7e86eb37b815961786ba49c7be2570ba59c84f0a0b95698debe", "text": "(Response 83) FDA acknowledges that \nthere are various methods for the assessment of breast density, which may include automated processes such as FDA-cleared density assessment software devices.

Furthermore, not all facilities may have or be able to afford the same equipment or software, and requiring specific equipment could potentially limit access to mammography services. Finally, the four density categories in this final rule are in wide use in current clinical practice, and will be more readily understood by clinicians than a report of individual results along a continuum. \n(Comment 84) A comment \nrecommends that the lay summary specify how dense breast tissue impacts the statistical accuracy of mammography. \n(Response 84) FDA disagrees with \nmaking this a requirement of the lay summary. The Agency notes that any information included in the lay summary must account for patient understandability. FDA concludes that including a discussion of statistics in the lay summary may detract from the effectiveness of the breast density notification and recommendations. Additionally, knowledge of breast conditions and disease processes is subject to change with ongoing research, and specific statistical information may become outdated and misleading.

In clinical practice, further management decisions are typically based on the distinction between non-dense and dense, i.e., two categories, as well as on \nother patient risk factors. The Agency believes that the two categories for breast density in the lay summary represent an appropriate balance between patient understanding and precision of the underlying information. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e32142c-12e2-4386-8327-1321285cfff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e32142c-12e2-4386-8327-1321285cfff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "792c3df5-b541-4f5d-9f1e-3b322d2cd687", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "cc83b7af4db0ac47f840a5a5cd5c0473fda313df42f9214982939656de484fdf"}, "3": {"node_id": "6294dc1d-6b78-418c-8fb5-c43edf35f7e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "d7179e540e9e746cefb48f4d9895f134fee301c755b5c029a2a66189340e4934"}}, "hash": "3755afd154090af313de8b6a911ec08ad5b348523ac895e1868e4851f1d80dd9", "text": "15147 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nWe believe that using four categories \nrather than two in the lay summary would not be more effective in communicating breast density information, and that doing so may be confusing to patients and burdensome to facilities.

Also, this may cause undue alarm to patients, as this term is subjective and will not be consistently interpreted by all patients. The healthcare provider will receive the report that assesses the density on a four-category scale, and can incorporate this information into their clinical recommendations to the patient. \n(Comment 86) A comment \nrecommends that when a patient views their online medical chart from their primary care physician, rather than a report that describes their breast density, the patient\u2019s actual mammogram images should be displayed, and the patient can assess where their own density is located along a normal distribution. \n(Response 86) FDA agrees that \npatients should be informed and empowered in the decision-making related to their healthcare. Therefore, this final rule includes the requirement for mammography facilities to directly notify patients of their breast density in the lay summary (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)), not through viewing a primary care provider\u2019s medical chart. However, we disagree with including an image display requirement for several reasons. First, the primary care physician or other referring healthcare provider may not have the mammogram images, unless the patient has requested that the images be sent to that provider (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii)). Also, requiring primary care physicians to display online medical charts in a \nspecific manner is not within the scope of the MQSA; furthermore, not all patients may choose to access online charts even when these are made available. We also conclude that it is not reasonable to expect patients to assess their own breast density and generate plans for followup based on their self- assessment. Finally, we note that providing patients with the images from \ntheir mammogram studies when requested continues to be a requirement in the final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii)), so if patients choose to do so, they can directly obtain their mammogram images from the performing facility, without any need to use their primary care provider as an intermediary. \n(Comment 87) A comment \nrecommends that, due to the variety of recommendations for patients with dense breasts, the lay summary should include a statement to follow the recommendations in the lay summary and in the report sent to the patient\u2019s healthcare provider. \n(Response 87) The Agency finds that \nthe notification language in this final rule for patients assessed to have dense breast tissue (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv)) is adequate. In the course of the clinical decision-making, the referring provider will typically read and interpret the mammography report, including its recommendations, in the context of other clinical information about the patient. We also note that all patients will receive the lay summary, but most patients (except for those who are self- referred) will not receive the report that is sent to the referring healthcare provider. A referred patient would therefore not typically have the ability to independently follow the recommendations in that report. Although the lay summary does not explicitly state that patients should follow the recommendations in the report to the patient\u2019s healthcare provider, it does state that patients should speak with their healthcare provider. That interaction is an opportunity for the patient to receive recommendations from their healthcare provider. \n(Comment 88) A comment \nrecommends that the lay summary should encourage patients and referring providers to discuss mammogram results with the radiologist who \ninterpreted the mammogram.

We agree that the IP for a mammogram is a potential resource for both patients and their healthcare providers, and this final rule does not prohibit communication between these parties. However, we conclude that it is neither necessary nor practical to include a recommendation for patients and healthcare providers to discuss the results of every mammogram with the \nIP. Workflow varies across facilities; many mammograms are interpreted in batches at times when the imaged patients are not present, and many mammograms are interpreted at sites other than the facilities where the images were performed. Therefore, the IP may not be readily available to speak to all patients. The recommendations to encourage all patients to discuss their results with the IP, or to require the facility to provide an opportunity for the patient to speak with the IP, are likely to cause a significant burden on IPs and facilities, and could reduce access to mammography services. Furthermore, the referring healthcare provider is likely to have a more complete knowledge of each patient\u2019s history and risk factors than the IP, and it is therefore more appropriate for the patient to discuss their results with their provider. There is also no need for the lay summary to encourage the referring healthcare provider to discuss the results with the IP, as the provider does not receive the lay summary (but does receive the more detailed mammography report). Healthcare providers who require additional information after reading a mammography report can typically contact the IP. \n(Comment 89) A comment asserts that \nDBT is considered supplemental to conventional mammography, and recommends that this be made clear in the notification wording, to prevent a large increase in orders for screening breast ultrasound examinations. \n(Response 89) FDA disagrees with this \ncomment. The choice of imaging modalities and the various clinical guidelines for breast cancer screening are more appropriately left to the judgment of the referring provider and the IP as part of the clinical decision- making process. However, FDA notes that many facilities that have DBT equipment use this DBT modality for primary screening of many or all of their patients, and do not reserve it only for supplemental screening. Furthermore, as noted in Response 108, with the exception of the medical outcomes audit (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1) in this final rule), the MQSA and its implementing regulations do not distinguish between screening and diagnostic mammograms. Under the MQSA and its implementing regulations, DBT is a mammographic modality, and is subject to MQSA quality standards and requirements, including the reporting requirements. Therefore, under this final rule, the lay summary for a DBT examination, just \nlike the lay summary for a screen-film mammogram or a full-field digital \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de907019-a662-45a1-a001-016e6718d74d": {"__data__": {"id_": "de907019-a662-45a1-a001-016e6718d74d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9a21f1-50e6-46b5-8e1f-4308d47ab9fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "69ea52ab3e654a6572e564ed67f1a4daa9946b3fc0151aa7117de76125d85e70"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6bd15f0-5c69-44ec-bee3-cb34e0092087", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "737bc293885ba7ba11912b6327eeee23426e5d38965cc465cd4cf167cae0356d"}}, "hash": "a138988aca4253991fd4e3fb865ff56e50ec6d4fd0bf4cd824d6c797c4289d02", "text": "15148 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nmammogram, must include the breast \ndensity notification that is appropriate to the patient\u2019s breast tissue (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)). See also Response 2. \n(Comment 90) A comment \nrecommends that, in addition to notifying patients about their breast density, the lay summary should also inform patients that ultrasound or MRI may be performed for additional screening. Another comment recommends that the lay summary should explicitly state that for women with dense breasts, it may be appropriate to consider additional imaging tests. Conversely, a comment notes that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has not taken a definitive position regarding supplemental MRI or ultrasound. \n(Response 90) In \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv) of \nthis final rule, the notification language for patients with dense breasts is being revised to include the statement that \u2018\u2018In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers.\u2019\u2019 FDA believes that this information, in addition to the recommendation to discuss breast density with a patient\u2019s healthcare provider that is also included in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv), provides a reasonable basis for the patient and the healthcare provider to determine an individual plan that takes into account that patient\u2019s breast density. FDA acknowledges that in current clinical practice, ultrasound and MRI examinations are frequently used as imaging modalities in breast evaluation; however, practice can change over time, and therefore we do not believe that it is necessary to specify these particular modalities in the lay summary, but rather, the various options may be discussed by the patient and the healthcare provider. In response to the comment recommending an explicit statement that it may be appropriate to consider additional imaging tests for women with dense breasts, FDA believes that the language in this final rule adequately communicates that other imaging tests may provide benefit in the evaluation of some patients with dense breast tissue. Finally, FDA agrees with the comment about the USPSTF. As noted above in Responses 2, 55, 62, \nand elsewhere, we have also not specified the further management of patients with dense breast tissue. \n(Comment 91) Several comments \naddress the grade level, literacy level, and readability of the notification wording, in general or for particular patient populations. A comment expresses concern that the wording is above the fifth grade level and may cause misunderstanding, confusion, and fear. Another comment recommends that the breast density notification should adhere to FDA\u2019s best practices requirement to use plain language and should ensure that the readability is at or below the eighth grade level, or that FDA should explain why this notification is not subject to its general policy on risk communications, and continues that if the reading level exceeds the eighth grade level, FDA should issue a supplemental rule with modified breast density notification. Another comment asserts that the reading level recommended for U.S. women is the fifth to sixth grade level, and recommends that any prescribed language should undergo assessment with tools such as Flesch-Kincaid, Dale- Chall, or the Patient Education Materials Assessment. A similar comment recommends that the Agency should apply textual analysis tools to its proposed notification and consider how to address issues raised with understandability and readability. A comment recommends that if FDA conducted message testing, the results should be made available, and if it did not, it should undertake testing to determine whether the notification is capable of achieving its intended purpose. Another similar comment recommends that FDA should use accepted readability tools to analyze its notification language for readability and understandability, and test the notification among a diverse and representative set of mammography- eligible women, to ensure that it is clear and understandable to all women, and adequately explains all \u2018\u2018hard\u2019\u2019 terms, particularly \u2018\u2018breast density.\u2019\u2019 Another comment recommends that the Agency should test the notification with an adequate sample of African-American and Hispanic women. \n(Response 91) FDA acknowledges \nthese comments. The notification language in this final rule is not intended to be a complete discussion of breast density, but rather to encourage further discussion between each individual patient and their healthcare provider.

The Agency also notes that the wording of the notification statements in this final rule is simpler than most of the State breast density notification statements currently used across the country, which are written at a higher reading level (see Ref. 8 for the State notification statements). The simpler language of the Federal notification statements represents a baseline national standard for density notification.

We have reviewed some of the research on the readability and understandability of breast density notification, such as References 37 to 40, including the research of the Boston University group (including Refs. 42 to 44). As noted in Responses 52 and 91, FDA believes that the revised notification language in this final rule appropriately balances readability, accuracy, and adequacy, and is simpler than most of the State breast density notifications currently in effect across the country. The revised notification statements in this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)) are consistent with the recommendations of most of these researchers, including that the density notification should be written at a lower grade level than most current State density notifications. The Agency agrees with the Boston University researchers (see Ref. 43) that the notification in this final rule should not be the only information a patient receives about breast density, but rather is intended to establish a consistent national baseline standard and to encourage further discussion between each individual patient and their healthcare provider. \n(Comment 93) Several comments \naddress the use of languages other than English. A comment recommends that FDA identify and require best practices for disseminating messages about breast density in multiple languages, to reduce anxiety and confusion. Another comment recommends that facilities should be urged or even required to translate the density information into the prevalent or dominant languages of their patient populations. Another comment asserts that there must be a Spanish translation, and recommends that translation into Mandarin, Hindi, or other commonly used languages should also be performed. \n(Response 93) FDA acknowledges that \npatients of limited English literacy may need assistance with the interpretation of the lay summary. However, FDA does \nnot believe that it is necessary to add additional language requirements for the lay summary. The MQSA and its implementing regulations establish baseline national standards. Under the current regulations, the required statements in the mammography report, such as the final assessment statement, are in English. Likewise, the required statements on breast density that this \nfinal rule adds to the mammography report (\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)) and the corresponding required breast density notification statements that this final rule adds to the lay summary (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)) are in English. Facilities are encouraged to make every effort to communicate with their patients, and FDA recognizes that facilities may choose to provide patients with a translation of the breast density notification statement, but FDA does not believe it is practical for the Agency to regulate such translation. The English- language notification statement in this rule must be included in the lay summary regardless of any additional information or translation that a facility may elect to provide to the patient. \nK. Breast Density Notification and the \nRole of the Referring Healthcare Provider \n(Comment 94) Several comments \nrecommend that, in addition to breast density notification, FDA should require that the report to the healthcare provider include a recommendation that the healthcare provider perform a risk assessment. \n(Response 94) The reporting \nrequirements in this final rule are intended to promote clear communication about the results of the mammogram, not to prescribe other aspects of patient care. FDA acknowledges that risk assessments may be an important component of care for some patients; however, the Agency generally defers to healthcare providers \nto determine when a risk assessment is appropriate for their patients, and so declines to require that such an express recommendation be included in mammography reports. As noted in several other responses, the notification statements to patients with dense or non-dense tissue both say, in part, \u2018\u2018Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) in this final rule).

However, we note that categorizing breast density is part of the IP\u2019s mammogram interpretation, and is not controlled by FDA. After the IP assigns a category, the final rule requires the category to be included in the mammography report, using the wording in this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) and (D)), to promote clarity of communication between the IP and referring healthcare provider. We also note that the two categories of breast density cited by the commenter, which appear in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(C) and (D), respectively, as well as the other two categories in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) and (B), are already in wide use and conform to current clinical practice. \n(Comment 97) A comment \nrecommends that additional information and images regarding breast density be provided to clinicians and patients, and that FDA should consider providing, for clinicians, a reference to a specific article on breast density and the risk of interval cancer (Ref. 45). \n(Response 97) FDA disagrees in part \nwith this comment.

A comment agrees with the proposed requirement to retain mammograms in the original modality in which they were obtained and not copied or digitized, and recommends that facilities be required to adhere to this requirement immediately upon publication of the rule rather than 18 months after publication of the rule. \n(Response 98) We note that neither \nthe proposed rule nor this final rule uses the phrase \u2018\u2018original format.\u2019\u2019 The rule states that mammograms must be presented for interpretation in the \u2018\u2018original mammographic modality\u2019\u2019 in which they were performed (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)), must be retained in retrievable form in the mammographic modality in which they were produced (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i)), and cannot be produced by copying or digitizing hardcopy originals (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i)). For mammographic images obtained by screen-film mammography, this means that the original films that were performed and used for interpretation must be retained, and they cannot be copied, scanned, or digitized to meet the record retention requirement. Mammographic images obtained by FFDM or DBT must be retained in digital format. In the rare situations in which FFDM images, which are produced in a digital format, are then printed and interpreted on hardcopy film, the facility may choose to retain this hardcopy print alongside the digital data, but if this hardcopy in turn is scanned or digitized, such scan cannot be the sole record of the examination that is retained. To ensure compliance with the requirement to maintain the original mammograms in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) and (ii), digital (FFDM or DBT) images must be retained such that the file format and all other characteristics of the original digital image files are preserved. Moreover, to ensure compliance with this requirement any CAD markings placed by computer software after the mammographic images are obtained, and which typically overlie and obscure portions of the image, must be removable and the images must be capable of being displayed without the CAD marks. A facility may choose to retain a set of the images with permanent CAD marks, but this set of \nimages alone would not meet the retention requirement. FDA does not believe that these requirements should be effective earlier than the other provisions of the rule. \n(Comment 99) Several comments \nrecommend requiring facilities to store and transfer images in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format. A comment recommends that DICOM be required so that proprietary file formats, which receiving facilities may not be able to view, are not used. \n(Response 99) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. Although FDA acknowledges that DICOM is currently the predominant format used for image files in medical imaging, requiring the use of a specific file format in the MQSA regulations is overly restrictive and may limit the future development of alternative formats, including formats that offer improvements. \n(Comment 100) Comments were \nreceived that recommend the use of lossy compression for digital mammogram images. \n(Response 100) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. Section 900.12(c)(4)(i) of this final rule states that a facility \u2018\u2018Shall . . . maintain the mammograms and mammography reports in a permanent medical record of the patient\u2019\u2019 for a specified time period, and \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) states that a facility \u2018\u2018Shall upon request by, or on behalf of, the patient, permanently or temporarily transfer the original mammograms and copies of the patient\u2019s reports to a medical institution, a physician or healthcare provider of the patient, or to the patient directly\u2019\u2019 during this time period. Thus, the facility must retain the original mammogram, and must have it available for transfer upon request. Because lossless compression permits complete reconstruction of the image data, images undergoing such compression would be generally considered to be \u2018\u2018original\u2019\u2019 mammograms for the purposes of \n\u00a7 900.12(c)(4) (this aligns with statements made by FDA in the PGHS (Refs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6d7923d-100c-4a54-b887-0d9db20b711f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6d7923d-100c-4a54-b887-0d9db20b711f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da1c305c-e8a4-476e-a92a-efae88577c88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "3237d952ea7e29eeed333b7ed69a0259d20ad7614ec54c4607e1467dd270edba"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f7df8ac-7419-492f-87e8-5fafcd21f5c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "e1952275f02148a6233e2a17749d1d05666364125816b1691d7d13bea0ef5703"}}, "hash": "9ef86ab12599f3e3288049447a4aabb3016bb48adb8697a4bed79c34e2457a87", "text": "46 to 48) regarding lossless compression of digital mammographic images). In contrast, images that have undergone lossy compression, which does not maintain all of the data related to the mammogram image files, would generally not be considered to be \u2018\u2018original\u2019\u2019 mammograms for the purposes of \u00a7 900.12(c)(4). Transferring images that have undergone lossy compression would have potential consequences regarding the ability to process the digital mammogram files, and potential implications for the visualization of both normal tissue and \nabnormalities that may extend beyond the subjective image quality. While we acknowledge that data storage and transfer may pose significant considerations for facilities, we do not believe there is consensus on what loss of information is acceptable while maintaining the standards to be able to review and/or transfer the original mammogram images as required in the regulations. \n(Comment 101) FDA received several \ncomments that requested clarification on the conditions by which digital mammogram files are transferred between facilities, including the permissibility of downloading images from one facility to another, digitization of comparison images, and uploading of digital mammogram images from a compact disc (CD) to a receiving facility\u2019s picture archiving and communication system (PACS). A separate comment recommends that FDA require that mammograms be available for electronic transfer rather than by using physical media such as a CD. Another comment recommends that FDA develop a cloud-based or electronic repository of mammogram images for all MQSA-certified facilities. \n(Response 101) Section \n900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this final rule address the transfer of original mammograms and release/provision of copies of mammograms, respectively. The Agency wishes to clarify its use of the terms transfer and release/provision of copies. In these regulations, \u2018\u2018transfer\u2019\u2019 means the conveyance of the mammogram such that the sending facility no longer retains it. Screen-film examinations often are transferred; transfer of FFDM and DBT examinations is extremely rare because the original images are typically retained in the sending facility\u2019s PACS even when copies are released upon request. In the final rule, FDA distinguishes between \u2018\u2018interpretation\u2019\u2019 (i.e., initial, repeat, or \nadditional review of a mammogram), for which an examination must be presented in the original mammographic modality in which it was performed (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1) in this final rule), and \u2018\u2018comparison\u2019\u2019 (i.e., using \na mammogram to aid in the interpretation of another exam), which is not subject to that requirement. Under the final rule, if transfer is requested, original mammograms must be transferred in the mammographic modality in which they were produced. Also, under the final rule, for interpretation purposes (including \u2018\u2018second opinion\u2019\u2019 or additional \ninterpretation), digital examinations must be presented to the IP in their \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dca5d9df-38dc-4b13-ad2e-d33ad64c02df": {"__data__": {"id_": "dca5d9df-38dc-4b13-ad2e-d33ad64c02df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa652fca-a9f7-40cc-9f9f-c536d8463af3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "f16ba39c2dfc5c33b05d04b2b6043eb740d6a114155c52e5bbf21c6a52f1ea9c"}, "3": {"node_id": "00a73f28-9b77-4b83-a927-cb59734b42e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "8eac54e0ae694a1d6706ca2b7b8abce6766ca20be78e38df93da853a30bda345"}}, "hash": "3054a9da64ca2826ca614ca540b6cc7ad59702f29b7093c17aa863d67db16d78", "text": "15151 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \noriginal digital modality. Thus, if a \nfacility requests an FFDM or DBT examination in order to perform a second or additional interpretation at the request of the patient or their representative, the exam must be provided in its original modality (FFDM or DBT, respectively). We note that this may be accomplished either through transfer of the original images (which is rare), following the processes described in \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iv) of this final rule, or through the release of a digital copy, following the processes described in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this final rule. FDA recognizes that many facilities may request the release of copies of mammograms not for interpretation of the requested exam, but for comparison purposes (i.e., in \norder to aid the interpretation of a subsequent exam); such release must follow the processes described in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(iii) and (iv) (see also Response 102 below). \nTechnical methods of either transfer \nor release are not prescribed by the final rule, and may include, but are not limited to the following (assuming such transfers/releases otherwise comply with applicable law): direct electronic transmission of digital mammogram files that is arranged between two facilities utilizing Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant and appropriate practices for privacy and data security; providing the requesting facility with HIPAA-compliant remote electronic access to the images in the PACS of the originating facility; the viewing of digital mammogram images located on a physical storage medium such as a CD; or the uploading of such images from a digital storage medium to a receiving facility\u2019s PACS. FDA views all of these methods as meeting the requirement to provide original digital images electronically. FDA disagrees with the comment recommending that FDA require facilities to have the capability to electronically transmit original images or copies, rather than transmit via physical media such as CD\u2013 ROM, as FDA believes such a requirement may be overly burdensome and could impact a facility\u2019s ability to operate, which could reduce patient access to mammography services. We also disagree with the recommendation that FDA should develop and maintain a repository of mammogram images performed at all MQSA-certified facilities. We note that while such a repository could facilitate image comparison between facilities, there are significant privacy concerns, and also concern for the expense and resources required to establish and maintain such \na repository. In addition, it may be excessively burdensome for facilities to participate in such a repository when facilities are already required to retain original mammogram images. \n(Comment 102) A comment \nrecommends that FDA develop a form asking if a facility is able to view hardcopy images, and a similar comment recommends that \u2018\u2018some consideration be given for facilities that no longer have equipment suitable for viewing hardcopy images.\u2019\u2019 A comment also recommends that facilities should be required to transfer 2D images and images from other breast imaging modalities only, but should not be required to transmit DBT image sets due to their file size unless specifically requested. \n(Response 102) FDA disagrees with \nthe recommendation to develop a form regarding hardcopy viewing capability. As discussed in Response 101, this final rule includes different requirements when transferring original mammograms versus when releasing copies (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this final rule). We reiterate that, in current practice, it is very rare for any facility to transfer a digital mammogram, whether FFDM or DBT. For these digital modalities, if a comparison is sought, typically only copies are provided, while the original images are retained by the performing facility, i.e., they are not transferred. \nThe requirements in this final rule are less stringent for the release of copies than for transfer of the original examination. Either original images or exact copies of digital exams may be used for interpretation (such as a second opinion) or comparison (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)). Copies of screen-film examinations may be used for comparison but not for interpretation (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)). However, FDA does not consider film copies of screen-film examinations to be in the original mammographic modality for purposes of \u00a7 900.12(c)(1), and thus such copies may be used for comparison but not for interpretation. As noted in Response 101, a facility may provide a digitized or scanned copy of a hardcopy original, such as a scan of a screen-film mammogram, either directly or via physical storage media.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00a73f28-9b77-4b83-a927-cb59734b42e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "00a73f28-9b77-4b83-a927-cb59734b42e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa652fca-a9f7-40cc-9f9f-c536d8463af3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "f16ba39c2dfc5c33b05d04b2b6043eb740d6a114155c52e5bbf21c6a52f1ea9c"}, "2": {"node_id": "dca5d9df-38dc-4b13-ad2e-d33ad64c02df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "3054a9da64ca2826ca614ca540b6cc7ad59702f29b7093c17aa863d67db16d78"}}, "hash": "8eac54e0ae694a1d6706ca2b7b8abce6766ca20be78e38df93da853a30bda345", "text": "Therefore, a receiving facility that cannot view a hardcopy image may request a scanned or digitized copy for comparison purposes; the original film is only required if it is being submitted for interpretation, such as a second opinion.

Also, images from \nnon-mammography imaging modalities are outside the scope of this rulemaking. \nM. Deadlines for Image Transfer and the \nRelease of Copies \n(Comment 103) Several comments \nwere received regarding \u2018\u2018transfer\u2019\u2019 of comparison studies between facilities. A comment states that 15 calendar days is too long for a facility to transfer patient mammograms if a final report is required within 21 to 30 days. A comment notes that 15 calendar days is too accelerated a time for facilities to transfer large image files such as those associated with DBT image files when original images are requested for transfer. A comment agrees with requiring transfer of images within 15 days, but it recommends that FDA encourage facilities to transfer images within 7 days. \n(Response 103) FDA generally \ndisagrees with these comments. As noted in Responses 101 and 102, this rule distinguishes between transfer of original examinations and release of copies. For digital (FFDM and DBT) examinations, it is very rare to transfer the original; when comparison is sought, typically a copy is released. However, under this rule, the required timeframe is the same for either the transfer of originals or the release of copies, and therefore this response addresses both scenarios. \nFDA believes that requiring the \ntransfer of original mammogram studies, and the release of copies, within 15 calendar days of a request provides adequate time for a comparison to be made and a followup report to be issued (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii)), because the receiving facility will be aware of the deadline for issuing the final report, and can prioritize making the necessary comparison upon receiving the prior examination. FDA also notes that 15 days is the maximum amount of time \nallowed for a facility either to transfer original mammogram studies or to release copies, and is intended to be a baseline requirement, but we anticipate that the transfer or release will frequently occur in less than 15 days. FDA disagrees that 15 days is too little time for DBT studies to be transferred (or copies to be released) between facilities, despite the size of the image files, as the size of the file does not significantly affect the time required to provide electronic access to it, transmit it, or copy it. FDA believes that requiring the transfer of original examinations or the release of copies within 7 days may not allow adequate time for a facility to effect this transfer or release. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5aa28916-6861-4d25-8be2-fd284c40a1cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "5aa28916-6861-4d25-8be2-fd284c40a1cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac1e6f22-0e1c-49e9-a55d-b45b3ce455bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "7663405cbde2ccf1592f8eab35e1d35b71350ed747a98027b489f8a31512fbb9"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ff3b06f-ee6e-4766-aaea-3c1715a99014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "3cf7f8d86a7d6c839fb40e31e8f5e69c6b54a7b5ef889c4d87a6cf111fc5810c"}}, "hash": "cb753efb1eea0a7695f665c5834fa89e3a7c961c696a8fdf9a78208296a8260c", "text": "15152 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \n(Comment 104) A comment \nrecommends that the 15-day \nrequirement for the transfer of patient files be reconsidered since some records are faxed or mailed and would be difficult for a facility to track, and because there are already specific rules for medical recordkeeping, making this requirement redundant. \n(Response 104) The 15-day deadline \nrefers to the sending of (or provision of electronic access to) the requested records by the sending facility, not to their receipt by the receiving facility. FDA acknowledges that delivery time may be delayed by factors that are beyond the control of the sending facility, so the tracking time is not included in the required timeline. Given the importance of ensuring timely communication regarding final results of mammograms, FDA disagrees that a deadline for facsimile transmission or delivery of physical media is overly burdensome as to warrant the removal of this requirement from the regulations. Moreover, although there may be other applicable State and local medical recordkeeping requirements, such requirements are subject to change/ repeal and there may be no requirements in certain States/localities. FDA believes it is important that there be consistent Federal regulations that clearly specify a timeframe in which a facility is required to transfer or release patient files, as this may have a significant impact on a patient\u2019s care \nand management. \n(Comment 105) A comment \nrecommends that FDA provide a guidance document that explains how a facility can demonstrate compliance with the records transfer and release requirements, including the method of determining the dates at which relevant actions occur. \n(Response 105) We believe the records \ntransfer and release requirements in this final rule, including the method of determining the dates at which relevant actions occur, are sufficiently clear. If facilities have specific questions about applicability to their situation, we believe such questions would be best addressed by directing the questions to FDA\u2019s MQSA Facility Hotline or the facility\u2019s AB. \nN. Facility Closure and Mammography \nRecord Retention \n(Comment 106) A comment \nrecommends that FDA create standard forms for use by closing facilities to communicate with patients and healthcare providers. Another comment recommends that the patients of a facility that closes or ceases mammography services should be notified, and a comment recommends \ndefining the term \u2018\u2018reasonable efforts\u2019\u2019 to be made in notifying affected patients. \n(Response 106) Due to the variety of \ncircumstances that may lead to the closure or cessation of mammography services at a facility, FDA believes that a standard form would not be feasible. This final rule requires that a facility that closes or ceases to provide mammography services notify its AB and certification agency of the arrangements that the facility has made, including making reasonable efforts to notify all affected patients (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v)). FDA believes this process will enable the AB and certification agency to assess the specific circumstances of the facility to help ensure that reasonable efforts are made by the facility to notify affected patients. Reasonable efforts may include, but are not limited to, sending written notification to patients using a traceable method, speaking directly to patients by telephone, or asking referring providers to reach those patients who the facility was unable to contact directly after attempting the above methods. However, FDA acknowledges the wide range of circumstances and unique factors that may be related to the reasonableness of a facility\u2019s efforts to notify all affected patients, and therefore this final rule requires the facility to discuss its notification efforts with its AB and certifying agency. \n(Comment 107) A comment \nrecommends that FDA include a requirement that before a facility closes or ceases performing mammography services, the facility must arrange for the permanent transfer of records to a facility that will provide access for at least 24 months. \n(Response 107) FDA disagrees with \nthis comment. Section 900.12(c)(4)(v) of the final regulations states that a facility that is closing or ceasing to perform mammography services must permanently transfer mammographic records to a patient or the patient\u2019s healthcare provider, or transfer the mammographic records to another facility or entity that will provide access to those records for the patient or the patient\u2019s healthcare provider for the time periods specified in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i), which are longer than \n24 months. Because mammography records can be of continuing value to a patient\u2019s care, the Agency believes that they should remain accessible for the same length of time whether they were performed at a facility that continues to perform mammography or whether they were performed at a facility that has closed or ceased to perform mammography.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ff3b06f-ee6e-4766-aaea-3c1715a99014": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ff3b06f-ee6e-4766-aaea-3c1715a99014", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac1e6f22-0e1c-49e9-a55d-b45b3ce455bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "7663405cbde2ccf1592f8eab35e1d35b71350ed747a98027b489f8a31512fbb9"}, "2": {"node_id": "5aa28916-6861-4d25-8be2-fd284c40a1cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "cb753efb1eea0a7695f665c5834fa89e3a7c961c696a8fdf9a78208296a8260c"}}, "hash": "3cf7f8d86a7d6c839fb40e31e8f5e69c6b54a7b5ef889c4d87a6cf111fc5810c", "text": "Therefore, the time \nperiods for retention specified in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) apply from the date of performance of the exam at the facility through the time after records are transferred from facilities that close or cease to perform mammography to another facility or entity that will provide access to patients and healthcare providers (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v) of this final rule). \nFDA also believes that if a \nmammography facility that is part of a medical entity such as a radiology practice or hospital ceases to perform mammography, but the medical entity does not close, the medical entity may be able to continue to retain and release the mammography records in a manner consistent with the requirements in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) through (iv). Accordingly, we are revising the proposed requirement that a facility must make arrangements for access by patients and healthcare providers to their mammographic records before the facility closes or ceases to provide mammography services, in \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v), to add that \u2018\u2018If a facility ceases to perform mammography but continues to operate as a medical entity, and is able to satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) through (iv), it may choose to continue to retain the medical records rather than transfer them to another facility, unless such a transfer is requested by, or on behalf of, the patient.\u2019\u2019 \nO. Mammography Medical Outcomes \nAudit \n(Comment 108) Several comments \nrecommend that FDA provide additional guidance regarding the medical outcomes audit, including clarification of the definition of a positive study, specifying which method should be used to calculate the PPV, and differentiating between \nscreening and diagnostic mammogram studies when calculating PPV. Related comments recommend the use of a patient\u2019s screening interval, which may or may not be 1 year, as the time period over which to calculate PPV, and updating the definitions of positive and negative studies in the MQSA implementing regulations to conform to the definitions in the ACR BI\u2013RADS 5th edition (Ref. 49). \n(Response 108) In \u00a7 900.2(mm), a \npositive mammogram is defined as a mammogram that has an overall assessment of findings that are either \u2018\u2018suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018highly suggestive of malignancy.\u2019\u2019 This definition was used in the discussion of the metrics for the outcomes audit within \u00a7 900.12(f).

In this final rule, only for the purposes of calculating the audit metrics, FDA has acknowledged the distinct clinical roles of screening mammography and diagnostic mammography. For clarification, in this final rule we are replacing the phrase \u2018\u2018For the purposes of these requirements\u2019\u2019 in the medical audit outcomes provision with the phrase \u2018\u2018For the purposes of these audit requirements\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1) in this final rule). \nWe note that the clinical practice \ncommunity recognizes several different methods for calculating the PPV, including the PPV1, PPV2sc, PPV2dx, and PPV3 (Refs. 49 and 50.). Of these variants, the PPV2sc includes the outcomes of all biopsy recommendations, whether that recommendation resulted directly from a screening mammogram (a sequence that is clinically discouraged (Ref. 49) and rarely occurs in practice) or from a subsequent diagnostic mammogram performed after an abnormal screening mammogram. As stated in \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)(i) in this final rule, FDA will require facilities to calculate the PPV as the percent of patients with positive mammograms who are diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year of the date of the mammographic examination. This metric is essentially identical to the PPV2sc used by the clinical practice community, and uses a 1-year interval like the PPV2sc. The use of this metric is considered a minimum requirement; facilities are also permitted to calculate additional PPVs using other methods if they choose to do so. However, FDA disagrees with the recommendation to adopt definitions from a particular edition of a particular clinical practice guideline, to avoid restricting the future development of mammography practice. \n(Comment 109) Several comments \nalso recommend clarification of the definition of cancer detection rate (CDR) and recommend separate calculations for CDR for screening and diagnostic mammogram studies. \n(Response 109) FDA recognizes that \nthe clinical practice community uses various methods for calculating CDR, including calculating CDR only for \nscreening mammograms, or separately for screening and diagnostic mammograms. The CDR calculation required by this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)(ii) in this final rule) is a single calculation for CDR for screening mammograms. As with Response 108, regarding PPV, the calculation method for CDR in this final rule is also considered a minimum requirement. \nFacilities are permitted to calculate CDR using additional methods if they choose to do so. However, FDA also notes that the PPV required by \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)(i) of this final rule is essentially equivalent to the CDR calculation for diagnostic mammograms, so by meeting the requirements of this final rule, facilities will be calculating both the CDR for screening mammograms and a value (i.e., PPV) using a calculation that is \nessentially equivalent to the calculation done for the CDR for diagnostic mammograms. \n(Comment 110) A comment states that \nin BI\u2013RADS, a screening mammogram assessed as either category 0, 3, 4, or 5 (i.e., Incomplete, Probably Benign, \nSuspicious, or Highly Suggestive of Malignancy, respectively) is considered positive, and may be suggesting that FDA adopt this approach. \n(Response 110) This final rule states \nthat recall rate will be calculated as the percentage of screening mammograms given an assessment of \u2018\u2018Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)(iii)). We note that assigning any of the other assessments mentioned by the commenter\u2014Probably Benign, Suspicious, or Highly Suggestive of Malignancy\u2014to a screening mammogram is clinically discouraged (Ref. 51) and rarely occurs \nin practice. \n(Comment 111) Several comments \nrecommend that FDA offer further guidance on how facilities should interpret medical outcomes data and derive performance data. A comment recommends linking the medical outcomes data with cancer registries. \n(Response 111) The medical outcomes \naudit is intended to allow each facility to assess and improve its own performance.

As noted in Responses 38 and 108, only a mammogram that receives an overall assessment of either \u2018\u2018suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018highly suggestive of malignancy\u2019\u2019 is defined as a positive mammogram (see \u00a7 900.2(mm)). This final rule adds the assessment category \u2018\u2018Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement\u2019\u2019 (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(G)), which may be assigned in the clinical scenario described in this comment. If a mammogram receives the assessment \u2018\u2018Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement,\u2019\u2019 rather than the positive assessment of \u2018\u2018suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018highly suggestive of malignancy,\u2019\u2019 then it is not a positive mammogram, and should not be counted in any audit calculations that track the outcomes of positive mammograms. \nFDA also reiterates that all of the \nassessment statements in the MQSA regulations are comprised exclusively of words or phrases, as noted in Response 35, and do not include numeric values or codes (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) and (v) of this final rule); code numbers are used together with assessments in some clinical practice guidelines, such as ACR BI\u2013RADS, but are not part of the approved assessment statements. \n(Comment 113) A comment \nrecommends maintaining the current medical outcomes audit requirements, as the comments states that additional requirements in the proposed regulations will result in inspection failures at facilities with limited resources. \n(Response 113) FDA disagrees with \nthe comment. The Agency believes that it is appropriate to provide the additional requirements for the medical outcomes audit that are included in this final rule (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)). The three additional metrics in this final rule are widely acknowledged in the clinical practice community and are already in wide use in mammography practices. Because all certified facilities already perform a medical outcomes audit, which for many facilities already includes these specific metrics, we believe that adding these metrics to the requirements will not be unduly burdensome. Also, we note that although MQSA inspectors will check whether each facility is performing these calculations, those inspectors generally will not document the specific values obtained by the audit. \n(Comment 114) Several comments \nrecommend additional clarification regarding the medical outcomes audit, including how it relates to annual facility inspection, how long it should be retained, and who has access to the audit. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d4ec96c-ad98-4186-bd99-b96b1c594312": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d4ec96c-ad98-4186-bd99-b96b1c594312", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a500404-4ff8-4f12-bce0-ec2d0da7440a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "eb07737b2a11ed516f8678034eec12a3c4fbc120dbd05c26720eaae6531d6274"}, "3": {"node_id": "77d55c55-0c4e-445b-b33f-7f846639247e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "63a74e649af9334bc0bb70372dfb3c1808eee40867f8f4a736fe37a0f4ef5004"}}, "hash": "c9e219968bd78b99d73b86c9f25896d3da072ff662288f5f5419e25a31c4562b", "text": "15154 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \n(Response 114) During a facility\u2019s \nannual inspection, the inspector \ngenerally will verify that a facility has completed its medical outcomes audit during the time period for which the annual inspection is evaluating the facility, or (in the event the inspection occurs during the first 2 years of the facility\u2019s operation) will verify that the facility has established the required audit procedures and designated an audit IP (Ref. 18). This final rule requires that facilities, at a minimum, calculate the PPV, CDR, and recall rate (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1) in this final rule), and the inspector generally will check whether these three metrics, at a minimum, have been calculated, or that the procedures for calculating them are in place, as applicable. However, FDA does not anticipate that the inspector will document the specific values obtained by the medical outcomes audit. The inspector will generally verify that the audit IP has notified each IP at the facility of their respective individual audit results and the facility\u2019s aggregate results, or, in the event the inspection occurs during the first 2 years of the facility\u2019s operation, generally will verify that the facility has established a procedure for such notification. The inspector generally will also verify that the audit IP has documented any followup actions taken, or that the facility has established a system for such documentation. Because the audit information is subject to inspection, at a minimum, the data must be retained by the facility until the MQSA inspection that covers that medical outcomes audit (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(4)). After the MQSA inspection that covers that medical outcomes audit, the facility and the audit IP may determine any ongoing utility of the medical outcomes audit data, and may elect a longer retention time if this is deemed beneficial to the facility. As noted, \u00a7 900.12(f)(3) requires that each IP be notified of that IP\u2019s respective individual audit results and the facility\u2019s aggregate results; beyond this requirement, the facility and the \naudit IP can determine who else, if anyone, may have access to the data. \nP. Patient and Referring Provider \nNotification \n(Comment 115) A comment \nrecommends that FDA and the State certification agency be required to directly notify patients and providers, and that they may use mass media only if all other options for direct notification have been exhausted, for PPNs, when a facility is not able or willing to perform the PPN. \n(Response 115) FDA disagrees with \nthe comment. The Agency notes that some facilities that have been required \nto perform a PPN have reported that they were unable or unwilling to do so, but the circumstances of each facility differed. This provision of the rule (see \u00a7 900.12(j)(2) of this final rule) expressly states that FDA or a State certification agency may notify the affected population if a facility is unable or unwilling to perform such notification. The requirement recommended in the comment could cause significant delays in notification of affected patients and their providers, related to both the attempt to identify all possible options and the practical considerations of performing individual notification. If a facility is unable or unwilling to perform a required PPN, FDA intends that State certification agencies and FDA will act in the manner that best serves the interests of public health and will consider the specific circumstances when selecting the method(s) for notification of patients and healthcare providers. \n(Comment 116) A comment \nrecommends that the description of non-physician healthcare providers in \u00a7 900.12(j)(2) (i.e., \u2018\u2018other healthcare \nproviders\u2019\u2019), in the context of PPNs, be included earlier in the final regulations. \n(Response 116) FDA agrees with the \ncomment. The reference to non- physician healthcare providers in \u00a7 900.12(j)(2) in this final rule revises this specific provision in the 1997 MQSA final rule (62 FR 55852), which previously listed only patients and their referring physicians as parties who must be notified in the event of a PPN.

Revocation of Certification \n(Comment 117) A comment \nrecommends using boldface text to state \nthat a State agency that is an FDA- approved State certification agency (SCA) under the States-as-certifiers provision may suspend or revoke a \ncertificate. \n(Response 117) FDA understands the \nconcern for readability of the regulations; however, FDA is unable to change the typeface and font used for display and printing of regulations in the CFR, as such stylistic issues are determined by the U.S. Government Publishing Office for the entire Federal government. For clarification, part 900, subpart C (\u2018\u2018States as Certifiers\u2019\u2019) establishes the procedures for a State to apply to become an FDA-approved SCA, and the requirements and standards for the SCA to use to ensure that all mammography facilities are adequately and consistently evaluated for compliance with quality standards at least as stringent as those established by FDA. SCAs are required to have appropriate criteria and processes for suspension and revocation of certificates and to have a process for appeals of inspection findings, enforcement actions, and adverse certification decisions (\u00a7 900.22(d) and (e)). SCAs cannot suspend or revoke certificates under the authority in \u00a7 900.14, but instead are required to have their own process for taking such actions. \n(Comment 118) A comment \nrecommends that FDA define an operator of a facility. \n(Response 118) FDA disagrees with \nthis recommendation. The exact role, responsibilities, and title of an operator varies depending on the specific circumstances of the individual facility and operator. Operators may include the lead IP, other IPs, QC technologist, other radiologic technologists, medical physicists, or other staff, depending on \nthe circumstances. Operators may have varied responsibilities, including but not limited to ensuring that a facility\u2019s quality assurance program meets the requirements set forth in this final rule, interpreting mammograms, evaluating the performance of mammography equipment, positioning patients for radiographic examinations, or performing other staff responsibilities at a facility. \n(Comment 119) A comment \nrecommends that a facility that has had its certificate revoked should not return to practice without probationary oversight. \n(Response 119) FDA disagrees with \nthis recommendation.

FDA thinks that the facility and its operators will have received sufficient training and completed sufficient corrective action before they are permitted to return to practice. Furthermore, upon returning to practice, the facility and personnel again become subject to all accreditation and certification requirements of the AB and FDA (or SCA). \nR. Interpreting Physician Qualifications, \nIncluding Continuing Experience \n(Comment 120) Several comments \nwere submitted regarding the continuing experience and continuing education requirements for IPs. Comments recommend: (1) increasing the number of mammographic examinations that an IP must interpret to satisfy the continuing experience requirement; (2) adding a requirement for a minimum number of diagnostic mammograms that must be read; (3) requiring continuous feedback to IPs on individual cases rather than only at the time of the annual medical outcomes audit; (4) requiring that IPs \u2018\u2018work up\u2019\u2019 their own recalled cases; and (5) requiring that IPs at facilities with lower volumes and in low-income areas be exposed to more mammography examinations. \n(Response 120) (1) Regarding the \nnumber of mammographic examinations \nan IP must interpret to satisfy the continuing experience requirement, although FDA acknowledges that there may be certain benefits to increasing the continuing experience requirement, this must be weighed against a potential loss in access to mammography services if IPs are unable to satisfy these increased requirements. FDA believes that the current continuing experience requirements, as described in \u00a7 900.12(a)(1)(ii), represent a reasonable balance between the goals of maintaining an IP\u2019s ongoing ability to interpret mammograms and preserving access to mammography services at facilities across the country. \n(2) Regarding an additional \nrequirement for a minimum number of diagnostic mammograms versus \nscreening mammograms, FDA again believes that while there may be certain benefits with such a requirement, establishing such a requirement may adversely impact the ability of IPs who work in varied settings to meet these requirements and to continue interpreting mammogram studies, again potentially impacting access to mammography services. Furthermore, as noted in Response 108, with the exception of the outcomes audit requirements (see \u00a7 900.12(f) in this final rule), the MQSA regulations do not distinguish between mammograms performed for screening or diagnosis. \n(3) Regarding the recommendation for \nrequiring continuous feedback on individual cases to IPs, FDA notes that there is a requirement in \u00a7 900.12(i) that \u2018\u2018[c]linical images produced by any certified facility must continue to comply with the standards for clinical image quality established by that facility\u2019s accreditation body.\u2019\u2019 To ensure compliance with such standards, facilities conduct regular periodic reviews of the image quality of samples of the images performed by each RT and the images accepted for interpretation by each IP (see Ref. 52). This is a mechanism for providing periodic image quality feedback to IPs. The Agency believes that this requirement, together with the requirement to provide IPs with outcomes feedback from the annual medical outcomes audit and the requirements for continuing education and continuing experience are reasonable and appropriate to ensure an IP\u2019s ongoing ability to interpret mammographic examinations. \n(4) Regarding the recommendation \nthat IPs be required to work up their own recalled cases, FDA notes that workflow as well as personnel schedules vary across facilities; also, some facilities perform only screening and not diagnostic mammograms. Therefore, we believe that such a requirement would be significantly burdensome for facilities to implement, and may be both impractical and restrictive for scheduling, both for the IP and for the patient, which could lead to decreased access to mammography services. \n(5) Regarding IPs at lower volume \nfacilities or in areas with a low-income \npopulation, such IPs are required to meet the continuing experience requirements (see \u00a7 900.12(a)(2)(ii)).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0c3c9cd-9f05-40e9-afdf-e92b1e112cd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0c3c9cd-9f05-40e9-afdf-e92b1e112cd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44e56385-5355-4ae5-b21c-ca5c71db350a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "efafae3eda4c786c6b46f12d07dfbdfb1ff98a6df927a966e24b3560144478c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d4ba254-36b0-4317-a917-2a072ddc6d0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "18c4d12c72e58a7abdfd5635c6de8983cd4de4ad346187ad37fafc47611956c6"}}, "hash": "06dbdc42df07673b982e05292ce7055d6b484a6a27625a266ee211a65868e801", "text": "FDA believes that placing additional requirements on IPs at these facilities would be detrimental to these facilities\u2019 ongoing ability to operate and provide services to their patient populations. As with other MQSA requirements, the continuing experience requirement is a baseline national standard; the MQSA regulations do not prohibit IPs from obtaining additional experience nor facilities from requiring that their employees obtain additional experience. \n(Comment 121) A comment \nrecommends that continuing education be specifically required to be obtained through active, case-based learning, and test sets with feedback. \n(Response 121) FDA disagrees with \nthe comment, and so has not incorporated this requirement in the final rule. FDA believes that the continuing education requirements for IPs, as described in \u00a7 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(B), are appropriate and adequate to ensure the ongoing education of IPs in mammography. Adding specific requirements such as those recommended by the commenter may be overly burdensome, risking a decrease in personnel and in patient access to mammography services. FDA also notes that specific requirements for active, case-based learning and for test sets with user feedback may be confusing to IPs and facilities determining how to satisfy such requirements. \n(Comment 122) A comment \nrecommends that double-reading be required for some IPs, such as newly trained IPs, requalifying IPs, or those who do not meet benchmarks. \n(Response 122) FDA disagrees with \nthe comment, and has not added this requirement in the final rule. FDA believes that the requirements for initial qualification of IPs, as described in \u00a7 900.12(a)(1)(i), and for requalifying IPs, as described in \u00a7 900.12(a)(1)(iv), are adequate, and in both of these situations, there is already a requirement for interpretation of certain numbers of mammograms under the direct supervision of a qualified IP. The MQSA and part 900 do not contain specific benchmarks for the performance of IPs in the interpretation of mammograms, and while we note that careful review of the results of the annual medical outcomes audit may be beneficial for IPs and informative in guiding their selection of continuing education to address areas where improvement is needed, we do not agree that it is necessary to introduce a requirement for additional supervised interpretation for qualified IPs. \nS.

The regulations already describe processes that facilities must follow regarding cleaning and disinfecting mammography equipment (see \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(e)(11)(ii) and 900.12(e)(13)). The Agency is not aware of information showing that the existing requirements have led to contamination of equipment. This final rule does not provide additional requirements beyond those already specified because we believe that these requirements are adequate in their detail regarding the cleaning and disinfecting of mammography equipment. \nT. Availability and Clinical Role of \nBreast Imaging Modalities, Screening Mammography Guidelines \n(Comment 124) A comment \nrecommends that facilities should be required to offer 3D mammography (i.e., DBT) and ultrasonography within 6 months of publication of this final rule; another comment recommends that facilities should be required to offer DBT within 10 years of publication of this rule; and a comment recommends that every mammography facility should be required to have at least one 3D mammography unit. A different comment suggests that a list of facilities offering advanced technologies, including 3D mammography, should be published. \n(Response 124) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. Various devices cleared or approved by FDA are respectively capable of performing examinations using different mammographic modalities, including screen-film, FFDM, and DBT; the choice of the specific technology used to image each patient is a decision by the IP and the patient\u2019s referring healthcare provider, if any. FDA does not require facilities to offer specific equipment or particular imaging modalities. Additionally, as stated in the proposed rule, Executive Summary section I.A, the MQSA and implementing regulations are designed to ensure that all patients nationwide have access to quality mammography services, and \nFDA is concerned that instituting a requirement to use only more expensive technology (e.g., DBT) may place a \nsignificant financial burden on facilities, potentially impacting their ability to operate, which may then reduce patient access to mammography services. Regarding the recommendation to publish a list of facilities offering 3D mammography, FDA does offer a public database of all certified facilities (Ref. 53), but the Agency thinks that including information on the equipment \nat each facility would be impractical, as equipment changes at facilities may occur at irregular and potentially frequent intervals, including both the introduction and removal of equipment, which may impact the accuracy of the information in such a list. \n(Comment 125) Many comments \nrecommend the use of specific medical imaging technologies, including 3D mammography and other modalities such as ultrasound and MRI, in varying clinical situations for the examination of patients with dense breasts. Specifically, several comments recommend that women with dense breasts should either have only 3D mammography performed, or have both 3D mammography and ultrasound performed, with a comment recommending that mammography and ultrasound should be performed every 3 months, or that imaging modalities other than mammography should be used. A comment recommends that information regarding the benefits of 3D mammography be provided to patients. Conversely, another comment recommends that 3D mammography be pulled from use until additional safety and efficacy studies have been performed due to its higher radiation dose compared to 2D imaging. Another comment recommends that patients be provided with information on ultrasound and that women should be able to choose to have either a mammogram or an ultrasound. \n(Response 125) FDA disagrees with \nincorporating these recommendations into the regulations. Certain 2D and 3D (i.e., DBT) mammography equipment \nhas been approved or cleared by FDA \nfollowing FDA\u2019s review of a premarket approval application or premarket notification (510(k)) submission. The choice of particular breast imaging modalities or screening time intervals, whether for patients with dense breasts or for any other patients, is a decision for healthcare providers to make in caring for their patients. Likewise, we defer to healthcare providers on provider-patient discussions regarding use of ultrasound or other tests when caring for their patients. \n(Comment 126) Several comments \nrecommend that providers be notified of the possibility that additional imaging modalities may be needed. \n(Response 126) The consideration of \nthe benefits, risks, and uses of various tests or imaging modalities is most appropriately left to the licensed healthcare provider. We decline to incorporate this recommendation. \n(Comment 127) Several comments \nrecommend that patients be informed of other options for breast imaging such as \nmolecular breast imaging (MBI), ultrasound, and MRI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e54f6ae8-5279-40b5-8382-b3b381424bb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e54f6ae8-5279-40b5-8382-b3b381424bb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c9c3fff-836c-4e00-bd9f-d0d53b3f4182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "fc380dd701a70a4d4afcda452c2b7252ba452bcceea50910a55c83b72fc47647"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f38219e-c054-4b52-864d-4cd7702633c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "08f6c96197ead5934c40aae5f61d8a4af8db1ccbd88f4470378bce565c986803"}}, "hash": "07bf2078ba01c5effe72185eef3e48e69ef9305ec7f2594314e4e118dd53aa9e", "text": "A comment also recommends that patients be informed that their health insurance plan may not cover these tests. \n(Response 127) FDA disagrees with \nadding a requirement to the regulations to inform patients of other options for breast imaging, including because the options for breast imaging may change with technological advancements. The required density notification language in the final rule includes a recommendation that all patients discuss their individual situation with their healthcare provider (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)), and advises patients with dense breasts that in some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iv)). Insurance coverage and reimbursement are outside the scope of these regulations; furthermore, FDA is also concerned that including references to insurance coverage in the lay summary may distract from the information in the breast density notification. \n(Comment 128) Several comments \nsuggest that MBI should be recommended to patients, be added to a list of supplemental screening methods, or have information about it provided to patients. \n(Response 128) FDA believes that \ndecisions about the use of various imaging modalities, including whether or not to consider them, are more appropriate for the healthcare provider to make, as they can take into consideration their understanding of the specific patient and the patient\u2019s needs from their relationship with the patient \nand medical history. \n(Comment 129) A comment \nrecommends that FDA approve thermography and ultrasound used together as an alternative to mammography. \n(Response 129) As we noted in \nvarious responses, the MQSA applies only to mammography activities. Accordingly, breast sonography and thermography are both outside the scope of this rulemaking and are both outside the scope of the MQSA. Additionally, FDA has issued a Safety Communication (Ref. 54) and a Consumer Update (Ref. 55) that warn that thermography is not an effective alternative to mammography, and that there is no valid scientific data to demonstrate that thermography devices, on their own or with another diagnostic test, are an effective screening tool for any medical condition, including the early detection of breast cancer.

Clinical Decision-Making \n(Comment 130) A comment \nrecommends that healthcare facilities be \nrequired to arrange mammography appointments for patients on the same day that a clinical breast exam is performed. Another comment recommends that healthcare providers be required to schedule followup appointments with patients reported to have dense breasts, and a comment recommends that physicians use shared decision-making with their patients. Several comments recommend that IPs be able to assume the role of healthcare provider for a patient with no referring provider, and that the IP should be able to order additional imaging studies such as ultrasound. A comment also recommends that patients be able to self-refer for supplemental breast imaging. \n(Response 130) FDA agrees that \nproviding timely breast imaging services to patients is important. However, the scope of the MQSA is limited to the regulation of mammography facilities and their activities (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(a)(3)), as opposed to regulation of more general healthcare provider practices, such as the ordering of imaging studies or general followup with patients by their primary care physician or referring provider. Radiologist ordering of additional imaging studies and patient self-referral for imaging are both largely dependent \non State or local requirements or specific facility policies and are outside the scope of this rulemaking (see also Responses 70, 89, 90, 125, and 131). \n(Comment 131) A comment \nrecommends that breast imaging centers should not refuse to perform annual mammography on patients with dense breasts. A comment recommends that facilities should interpret mammograms in real time and add ultrasound for patients with dense breasts. Another comment recommends that radiologists use all available technologies to determine breast density. \n(Response 131) The MQSA \nregulations do not take a position on the frequency or interval for screening mammography, as these vary and FDA generally defers to healthcare providers on such matters involving clinical decision-making with their patients. Similarly, other than the requirement to issue the report and lay summary (following interpretation of the mammogram) within respectively specified time periods (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2) and (3) in this final rule), the timing and workflow for the interpretation itself is generally outside the scope of this rule. FDA notes that imposing a requirement to interpret examinations in real time may be overly burdensome to many facilities and may impact their ability to operate, thus reducing patient access to mammography services. The recommendation to require facilities to add ultrasound or other non- mammographic breast imaging modalities is outside the scope of authority of the MQSA, and is addressed in responses to other comments (see Responses 2, 4, 6, 41). FDA also concludes that a requirement for facilities to use all available technologies, or any particular technology, to determine breast density is overly burdensome and would unnecessarily restrict facilities both in terms of the resources and time required to acquire the equipment and to implement such a requirement. Also, the MQSA regulations do not require the use of specific devices; similarly, no AB is permitted to require the use of specific devices or products as a condition of accreditation (see \u00a7 900.4(a)(5)). \n(Comment 132) Comments \nrecommend that mammography patients should be informed of the limitations and radiation risk of mammography and asked to provide consent prior to undergoing mammography, and that patients should be informed of the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of breast cancer due to screening mammography. \n(Response 132) As noted in Response \n131, the clinical indications used to decide when to perform a mammogram are more appropriate for the referring healthcare provider to consider. FDA notes that the healthcare provider who refers a patient for a mammogram can discuss with that patient the benefits and risks of the examination, including the implications of the potential results, and the patient and provider can utilize shared decision-making to determine whether to proceed with the examination. Additionally, although not addressed in the MQSA or its implementing regulations, a critical component of FDA premarket approval or clearance of any mammography equipment is a benefit-risk analysis that considers the radiation exposure associated with imaging with the device, among other information, before determining that the device meets the standard for approval, clearance, or marketing authorization when used according to its stated indications (Ref. 56).

As we noted in Response 131, the choice of a screening time interval and other clinical decisions related to mammography are more appropriate for the healthcare provider in the course of clinical decision-making with the patient. \nV. Insurance Coverage \n(Comment 134) Many of these \ncomments recommend the following: (1) \ninsurance should cover all breast imaging services, including mammography, MRI, ultrasound, and breast biopsy procedures; (2) insurance should be required to reimburse for \u2018\u20183D breast imaging\u2019\u2019 (this term is not specific, but the commenter may be referring to DBT, which is a mammographic modality subject to MQSA); (3) insurance coverage should not be impacted by a patient having dense breasts; (4) insurance coverage should be mandated such that socioeconomic disparities in treatment and outcomes will not be worsened; (5) additional reimbursement per examination should be granted to facilities in rural and underserved areas to cover the cost of new equipment; and (6) genetic testing and patient education should be provided at no additional expense to the patient. Another comment suggests that FDA should \nlimit the interest rate charged by equipment manufacturers for facilities that finance equipment purchases from them. Finally, several comments recommend requiring insurers, including Medicare/Medicaid, to increase reimbursement for screening mammography and to eliminate patient expense for annual mammograms for patients aged 40 to 74 years and for high-risk patients aged 25 to 40 years. \n(Response 134) FDA considers the \nrecommendations within these comments to be outside the scope of its authority to regulate under the MQSA or other authorities.

We conclude that the current final rule represents an appropriate balance between costs and benefits, with the goal of improving mammography quality and the public health. \n(Comment 136) One comment \nexpresses support for the modernization of the MQSA regulations, but states that the \u2018\u2018breast x-ray examination fee is relatively high in the proposed rules, \nwhich ranges from $600 to $1,800,\u2019\u2019 and recommends that the regulations provide examination methods that are less expensive than mammography. \n(Response 136) FDA appreciates the \ncommenter\u2019s support for the regulations. We note that the commenter misunderstood the preliminary economic analysis, which estimated at between $615.44 and $1,819.96 the present value of the costs to each facility to implement the changes to the MQSA regulations; these costs do not represent a fee charged to a patient undergoing a mammogram. Furthermore, as we noted in Response 134, issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement are outside the scope of FDA\u2019s authority. \n(Comment 137) Several comments \nstate that the benefits estimated in the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis related to fatalities and cost savings due to density reporting are not supported by existing evidence, and that the estimates of costs of overtreatment and overdiagnosis are omitted from the analysis. \n(Response 137) Recent research has \nshown that 7 percent to 11 percent of patients who are informed that they have dense breasts undergo supplemental ultrasound screening (Refs. 57\u201359). Research studies have also shown that adjunct ultrasound screening in high-risk women with dense breasts results on average in the detection between 2.75 to 3.90 additional cancers per 1,000 women (Refs. 11, 32, and 60 to 62). Because survival rates are higher for cancers detected at an earlier stage, early cancer detection due to supplemental screening such as ultrasound for women with dense breasts may result in a reduction \nin cancer fatalities. We use this existing evidence to support our analysis related to quantified benefits of breast density reporting requirements. These potential outcomes are discussed qualitatively in the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) (Ref. 63). Additionally, the density notification requirement does not discuss additional clinical management beyond imaging. We believe that a discussion of overtreatment and overdiagnosis of cancer is outside the scope of this rulemaking, and so have not been addressed by this analysis. \n(Comment 138) A comment suggests \nthat the analysis be revised to include distributional and equity effects. \n(Response 138) FDA recognizes that \ndistributional and equity considerations may exist as they relate to mammography practice and density notification. We have revised the distribution section of the FRIA to include a qualitative discussion of sociodemographic differences in mammography practice and outcomes. \nX. Federalism and the Relationship \nBetween Federal and State Breast Density Reporting Requirements \n(Comment 139) Some comments \nrecommend that FDA clarify the relationship between Federal and State breast density requirements, and specifically: (1) whether facilities must always use the Federal breast density notification language and (2) whether the Federal breast density notification requirements preempt State requirements. If there is preemption, a \ncomment states that FDA should consider whether it has adequate evidence to justify such preemption, consistent with Executive Order 13132 (Ref. 64). Some of the comments submitted regarding preemption seem to be addressing express preemption, whereas others seem to be addressing implied preemption. \n(Response 139) With regard to the first \nquestion, all facilities providing mammography services will be required to comply with FDA\u2019s reporting requirements, regardless of whether there are applicable State requirements. Under \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi), (c)(2)(iii), and (iv), facilities must provide the breast density information specified in those regulations in mammography reports to healthcare providers and in lay summaries to patients.

As discussed in Response 140, FDA believes these requirements are critical, among other things, to ensuring that patients and healthcare providers receive accurate, complete, \nand understandable breast density information. \nWith regard to the second question, \nFederal law can expressly preempt State law when the text of a Federal statute explicitly manifests Congress\u2019s intent to displace state law. Federal law also can impliedly preempt State law when Congress\u2019s preemptive intent is implicit in the relevant Federal law\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. Courts have identified two subcategories of implied preemption\u2014field preemption and conflict preemption. Field preemption occurs when a comprehensive scheme of Federal regulation implicitly precludes supplementary State regulation. Conflict preemption occurs when simultaneous compliance with Federal and State law is impossible (\u2018\u2018impossibility preemption\u2019\u2019) or when State law poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of Federal goals (\u2018\u2018obstacle preemption\u2019\u2019). \nHere, Congress included a \npreservation provision addressing State laws, which provides: \u2018\u2018Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of any State to enact and enforce laws relating to the matters covered by this section that are at least as stringent as this section or the regulations issued under this section.\u2019\u2019 (42 U.S.C. 263b(m)). Thus, the statute preserves any State law that is \u2018\u2018at least as stringent\u2019\u2019 as the regulations issued by FDA under the MQSA. See also 138 Cong. Rec. 33615 (October 7, 1992) (\u2018\u2018The bill allows and encourages states to carry out the certification program requirements and to implement standards no less stringent than those of the national program.\u2019\u2019). \nBased on the preservation clause of \nthe MQSA, FDA\u2019s reporting requirements do not preempt State reporting requirements that are \u2018\u2018at least as stringent\u2019\u2019 as the Federal requirements. The provisions of the MQSA, however, do not resolve which State reporting requirements, if any, that are less stringent than the Federal requirements may be subject to preemption. That analysis would be informed by the specific provisions of the State laws in question, and FDA has not undertaken a 50-state analysis of all current State breast density reporting laws. We note, however, that it is \npossible for a State breast density reporting law to be preempted based on these regulations. For example, if a State law theoretically were to prohibit facilities from providing a breast density notification to patients with non-dense breasts, we believe that law could be preempted because it would be impossible for facilities to comply with \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a78baeb-226b-4bf1-affd-6f1db0da7d52": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a78baeb-226b-4bf1-affd-6f1db0da7d52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9946551c-4bc6-4077-842d-e2ecbfadab61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "71b8babb1725e675fbdc1c6df27d6391342fb107312b065eb3116b240b0dee32"}, "3": {"node_id": "267ca84e-63ff-445e-a6ae-5956d24a951b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "87abfcbd67112808e402269cfa8097049f2b32508ed51f785f66a885f1d27a18"}}, "hash": "75e210b4e8f106eb5aa1f02486a0a7f60fde55ca4701e0a30283bdbe1ef6a7ba", "text": "15159 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nboth the Federal law (which requires \nsuch breast density reporting) and the State law (which forbids it). As another example, if a State were to require a breast density statement that directly contradicts or undermines a key message in FDA\u2019s breast-density reporting requirement (such as the message that \u2018\u2018dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018dense tissue . . . raises the risk of developing breast cancer,\u2019\u2019), that State law could be preempted on the basis that it poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of FDA\u2019s goals in communicating clear, consistent, and understandable information about breast density to patients and healthcare providers. \nFor further discussion of this final \nrule and the federalism principles expressed in Executive Order 13132, please see other responses in section X. \n(Comment 140) Several comments \nexpress concern with having potentially two different breast density notifications for patients and their healthcare providers, one required by Federal law and one required by State law. The comments note that different notifications could lead to patient confusion and be overly burdensome for facilities. For these and related reasons, some comments recommend that FDA include a clear statement that the Federal breast density reporting requirements preempt State requirements, while other comments recommend that FDA not require Federal breast density reporting language and allow State language to be used instead, at least in certain circumstances (e.g., so long as certain \ninformation is included in the notification). One comment proposes that FDA develop a \u2018\u2018waiver\u2019\u2019 process to allow the State to apply to FDA to use its alternative notification. \n(Response 140) FDA declines to adopt \nthese recommendations. As previously explained, all facilities providing mammography will be required to comply with FDA\u2019s reporting requirements, regardless of whether there are applicable State requirements. As such, all patients will receive information about their breast anatomy, and this rulemaking will require consistent baseline information be provided. But the statute does not \nauthorize FDA to categorically assert preemption over all State reporting requirements. As discussed in Response 139, Congress specifically preserved State laws that are at least as stringent as Federal law. Depending upon the circumstances, some State laws could be found to be preempted, such as less stringent State laws that make it impossible to comply with both Federal \nand State requirements, or that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Federal goals. FDA has not performed a State by State analysis to determine whether any specific, current State law may be subject to preemption. FDA notes that no comment proffered a State law that was asserted to be subject to preemption. \nWe also disagree with the \nrecommendation that FDA does not require Federal breast density report language and allow certain State breast density language to be used alone instead. Although FDA recognizes that many States have their own breast density reporting requirements, the Agency believes that consistent national breast density reporting requirements are critical in order to ensure that: (1) breast density reporting occurs in all States and (2) patients and healthcare providers receive accurate, complete, and understandable breast density information. \nFirst, the Agency believes it is \nimportant to ensure that patients receive a baseline set of key breast density information. Not all States currently have a breast density reporting requirement. If FDA does not require breast density reporting, in those States that also do not have reporting requirements, patients and their healthcare providers generally would not receive any breast density information, which raises significant public health concerns for all of the reasons set forth in this preamble, and the preamble to the proposed rule. \nSecond, even in those States that \nalready have a breast density reporting requirement, FDA believes there is value in having a single, consistent set of FDA-required information shared with the public. FDA breast density notification language is drafted by FDA subject-matter experts, contains the information FDA believes is critical to communicate, and is drafted using easily understandable language. FDA \ndoes not have the resources to monitor all State laws, particularly as they change over time, in order to ensure that the key information is being communicated consistently and effectively to patients and providers under State law.

We believe that the clear language and the recommendation to talk directly to the healthcare provider will minimize the likelihood of patient confusion. \nRegarding the potential burden on \nfacilities, we believe the breast density notification requirement established in this final rule is simple for mammography facilities and Agency personnel to understand and implement. Ultimately, FDA anticipates that it will be easier for both facilities and the Agency if FDA requires uniform notification language, which consists of specific language for the overall assessment of breast density in the mammography report (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)) and four to five lines of text in the lay summary to patients (see \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv)), as opposed to permitting State language to be used alone in certain circumstances. FDA is concerned that alternative approaches, such as requiring that specific information rather than specific statements be communicated to patients, would be complex, inefficient, and difficult to administer, and would consume unnecessary resources in the long term. Moreover, including FDA- required text in mammography reports and lay summaries will not be unduly burdensome for facilities, including because facilities will not need to expend resources in crafting their own language.

Effective Date of This Rule \n(Comment 142) A comment \nrecommends that all provisions of the \nrule except the density notification should become effective 6 months after publication. Conversely, some comments assert that 18 months is an inadequate period of time for facilities to implement the new requirements under the rule. A separate comment recommends that FDA consult with equipment manufacturers regarding an appropriate implementation date. \n(Response 142) FDA disagrees with \nthese recommendations. FDA does not anticipate that facilities would be able to implement all of the requirements of this rule into facility practice within 6 months without undue hardship. Based on FDA\u2019s experience with the effective date of the previous MQSA final rule (62 FR 55852), FDA concludes that 18 months is a practical timeframe for this final rule to take effect (see also Response 20). Regarding the recommendation to consult with equipment manufacturers, FDA notes that, beyond meeting any applicable FDA premarket authorization \nrequirements for medical devices, the provisions of this final rule do not necessitate the design or manufacture of any new equipment by manufacturers. Moreover, all members of the public, including equipment manufacturers, had an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. As such, recognizing that FD&C Act requirements have been, and continue to be, applicable to medical devices generally, notwithstanding the provisions in this final rule, FDA does not believe that specific consultation is warranted. \n(Comment 143) Several comments \nrecommend that the breast density notification requirements become effective earlier than 18 months after publication of the final rule, including specific recommendations for alternative timeframes of 30 days or 12 months. Another comment recommends allowing flexibility in the effective date of the breast density notification requirements due to the cost of making these changes. \n(Response 143) FDA disagrees with \nthese comments. FDA notes that breast density notification is an important \naddition to the final regulations; however, we also note that facilities should be allowed adequate time to implement these requirements into their facility practice before the requirements become effective. In addition, the breast density notification requirements should not be subject to a separate scheduled effective date than other requirements in this final rule. Facilities are not precluded from including the required breast density notifications prior to 18 months if they choose to do so, and considering any applicable State requirements. Because of the importance of establishing a consistent national standard for density reporting and notification, FDA does not agree that a longer effective date of this provision is warranted. Although there may be financial considerations for a facility in transitioning to compliance with the breast density notification requirements, FDA has concluded that 18 months is an adequate amount of time to make any necessary changes. \nZ. Miscellaneous Comments \n(Comment 144) A comment \nrecommends that FDA and the ACR \nfocus on increasing the consistency and quality of MQSA inspections by inspectors. \n(Response 144) The ACR and other \naccreditation bodies are only involved in facility accreditation, not certification or inspection. Inspection is part of the process of certification, not accreditation. FDA trains all MQSA inspectors, both FDA employees and \nthose who are State employees that perform MQSA inspections under State contracts with the Agency. FDA sends updated information to all inspectors whenever necessary. Furthermore, other FDA staff including Radiological Health representatives and auditors oversee and provide inspectional guidance to inspectors. The Agency concludes that these existing measures already promote consistency and quality in the MQSA inspection process. \n(Comment 145) A comment \nrecommends that FDA become the sole AB, and hire some of the staff currently employed by the ACR AB. \n(Response 145) FDA disagrees with \nthis comment. The MQSA and the implementing regulations distinguish between the separate responsibilities of the ABs and the certification agencies, which include FDA and the SCAs (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(e) and (q); part 900, subparts A and C).

The ABs already initially and continually assess mammographic image quality at facilities they accredit, and are required to inform FDA of equipment or practices that may pose a serious risk to human health (see \u00a7 900.4(a)). At this time, FDA believes that the regulations afford FDA adequate opportunities to investigate any such occurrences and take action as necessary (see part 900, subpart B). The AB\u2019s responsibilities include not only reviews of the initial and renewal accreditation images, but also random image reviews of a sample of facilities accredited by the AB. The interpretation of a mammogram is a decision made by IPs, but we note that many of the MQSA regulatory requirements, including the initial and continuing qualifications for IPs and the annual medical outcomes audit, promote quality mammography practice by IPs. \n(Comment 147) A comment \nrecommends that an independent commission review the relationship between the ACR and FDA for conflict of interest. \n(Response 147) FDA disagrees with \nthis comment. The relationship between FDA and each of the ABs, including the ACR, is regulated by the MQSA and the implementing regulations and meets all applicable Federal ethics requirements \n(see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 201, et seq.). \n(Comment 148) A comment asserts \nthat improving mammography outcomes, such as lower rates of recalls and biopsies, could justify different clinical protocols, such as a younger screening age and shorter screening interval than are currently supported by the USPSTF. \n(Response 148) This comment is \nbeyond the scope of this rulemaking. This final rule requires that each facility include recall rate and certain other metrics in the audit of its mammography medical outcomes (see \u00a7 900.12(f)(1)(i) through (iii) in this final rule), but the MQSA quality standards do not specify benchmark or target values for these metrics. This rule requires that facilities compile this information and review it internally, to encourage their own quality improvement.

FDA disagrees with the recommendation to propose unique amendments to address a specific clinical condition apart from the requirements at \u00a7\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) and 900.12(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) in this final rule, which, as discussed in other responses throughout this final rule, are necessary to address the limitations of mammography in the presence of dense breast tissue caused by any etiology. \n(Comment 150) One commenter cites \na news article that discusses a research \nstudy showing that breast cancer screening increases the detection of early-stage cancers rather than late-stage cancers. \n(Response 150) The intent of the \nMQSA is to ensure that the practice of mammography, across the country and whenever it is recommended by clinicians, meets consistent baseline quality standards. Decisions about whether to follow any recommendations or guidelines regarding patient age or interval for screening mammography are decisions more appropriate for the patient\u2019s clinical healthcare provider to make. \n(Comment 151) One comment states \nonly \u2018\u2018Should be standard of care for all women.\u2019\u2019 \n(Response 151) The subject of the \ncomment is not clear. FDA notes that the MQSA requirements apply consistently to all facilities that provide mammography services. Thus, every person who undergoes mammography at a certified facility in the United States can be assured that baseline national quality standards apply. However, decisions on whether to follow clinical practice guidelines, including recommendations for screening mammography at a certain age and/or a certain time interval, and any other clinical standards of care, are more appropriately made in the course of clinical decision-making by the provider and the patient. \n(Comment 152) A comment \nrecommends that image quality must be held to the highest possible standard. (Response 152) FDA believes the \namended regulations will continue to ensure appropriate national standards for quality mammography services. We note that provisions of the MQSA and its implementing regulations, including many that are not amended in this final rule, already address image quality. These include: the role of the ABs in clinical image review and phantom image review (\u00a7 900.4), the eight image quality attributes that must be included in AB clinical image reviews (\u00a7 900.4(c)(2)(i) through (viii)), personnel qualifications (\u00a7 900.12(a)), equipment requirements (\u00a7 900.12(b)), quality assurance requirements (\u00a7 900.12(d) through (f)), and the general requirement that clinical images must continue to comply with the image quality standards of the facility\u2019s AB (\u00a7 900.12(i)). We further note that some of these requirements related to the facility\u2019s responsibility to maintain clinical image quality were highlighted by the introduction in 2017 of FDA\u2019s Enhancing Quality Using the Inspection Program (EQUIP) initiative (Ref. 52). \n(Comment 153) A comment \nrecommends that FDA should spend $2.5 million per year for 10 years for public service announcements, advertisements, and a website. \n(Response 153) FDA disagrees with \nthe comment. General patient outreach and education is not within the scope of this final rulemaking. The MQSA program certifies mammography facilities and is funded largely by the user fees paid by those certified facilities. However, we note that the MQSA program maintains a public website (Ref. 65), and also occasionally uses email and social media to disseminate important information about the MQSA program. FDA also notes that the HHS Office of Women\u2019s Health, and the FDA Office of Women\u2019s Health are each committed to advancing issues regarding women\u2019s health and to providing health education materials through outreach activities and collaborative partnerships.

Similarly, individual grant- making activities are also outside the scope of this rulemaking. \n(Comment 155) A comment \nrecommends that FDA name this rule in memory of an advocate for breast density notification. \n(Response 155) FDA appreciates the \ncomment. We acknowledge the important work done by advocates for breast density notification in educating the public about the significance of breast tissue density. However, we disagree with the recommendation to name this rule after any one individual.

The MQSA is found under the Public Health Service Act in Title 42 of the U.S.C., and it is implemented by DMQS in FDA\u2019s CDRH. The authority for FDA\u2019s regulation of drugs and medical devices is found under the FD&C Act in Title 21 of the CFR. \nVI. Effective Date and Compliance Date \nThis rule is effective 18 months after \nthe date of publication in the Federal \nRegister. Mammography facilities will need to be in compliance with the amended MQSA regulations in this final rule by September 10, 2024. \nVII. Economic Analysis of Impacts A. Introduction \nWe have examined the impacts of the \nfinal rule under Executive Order 12866, \nExecutive Order 13563, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601\u2013612), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104\u20134). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct us to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this final rule is a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act \nrequires us to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc2a02e2-d35b-4109-be0a-3c60c7655f63": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc2a02e2-d35b-4109-be0a-3c60c7655f63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "766806a4-63b6-4343-b668-06b953846368", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "57c183d1e8156e9f73f606a8eaf9e3ec1f9c30e7cbecb48f3eef3ce250289c7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "98e21d12-e32f-40c1-bbd5-dda3c2d756fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "a2e3464bd3145ab4d6b63561c9cc7c743b0f0284758bc9dcaa435adf302c30f9"}}, "hash": "291bbdd5bfb8f9b83e304ee521c2b03675241d79eb299c06aea6765e1e91a3d3", "text": "15162 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nimpact of a rule on small entities. \nBecause many facilities that will be affected by this rule are defined as small businesses, we find that the final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nof 1995 (section 202(a)) requires us to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits, before issuing \u2018\u2018any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.\u2019\u2019 The current threshold after adjustment for inflation is $165 million, using the most current (2021) Implicit Price \nDeflator for the Gross Domestic Product. This final rule would not result in an expenditure in any year that meets or exceeds this amount. \nB. Summary and Accounting Statement \nThe final rule will modernize \nmammography regulations by \nincorporating current science and mammography best practices to improve the delivery of mammography services. These updates include requirements on recordkeeping, reporting, and \ncommunication of results. This final rule also addresses procedural requirements in several areas related to quality control and management of mammography facilities. \nThe benefits and costs associated with \nthis final rule are summarized in table 1. The quantified benefits are derived from reduced mortality and breast cancer treatment costs resulting from the breast density reporting requirements. We use two methods of measuring the value of reduced mortality: the value per statistical life (VSL) approach and an approach based on the value of lost life years (LY). Under the VSL approach, the estimate of annualized benefits over 10 years ranges from $42.00 million to $232.69 million at a 7 percent discount rate. Using a 3 percent discount rate, the annualized benefits range from $48.42 million to \n$266.09 million. Under the LY approach, the estimate of annualized benefits over 10 years ranges from $12.99 million to $66.90 million at a 7 percent discount rate. Using a 3 percent discount rate, the annualized benefits range from $8.50 million to $37.96 million. Because there is uncertainty in the literature about the most appropriate method for analyzing reduced mortality \nfor the population affected by this final rule, we do not present a primary value and use estimates from both methods to create the range of values in table 1. The high estimate in table 1 is based on the VSL approach, which yields the higher- bound estimate of the two methods. The low estimate is based on the LY approach, which yields the lower-bound estimate of the two methods. Other benefits that we are not able to quantify include reduced cancer morbidity and improvements in the accuracy of mammography by improving quality control and strengthening the medical audit. \nThe costs of the final rule include \ncosts to mammography facilities to comply with the requirements of the regulation and costs associated with supplemental testing and biopsies resulting from the breast density \nrequirements. The estimate of annualized costs over 10 years range from $28.87 million to $45.42 million at a 7 percent discount rate with a primary value of $36.31 million. Using a 3 percent discount rate, the annualized costs range from $27.61 million to $44.16 million with a primary value of $35.05 million. \nTABLE 1\u2014S UMMARY OF BENEFITS AND COSTS IN MILLIONS 2020 D OLLARS OVER A 10-Y EARTIMEHORIZON  \nCategory Primary \nestimate Low \nestimate High \nestimate Units \nNotes \nYear dollars Discount \nrate \n(percent) Period \ncovered \n(years) \nBenefits: \nAnnualized Monetized $/year .............. .................... $12.99 \n8.50 $232.69 \n266.09 2020 \n2020 7 \n3 10 \n10 \nAnnualized Quantified ......................... .................... .................... .................... .................... 7 \n3 ....................\nQualitative ............................................

This action is intended to facilitate communication among mammography facilities, healthcare providers, and patients; facilitate the retrieval of mammography images; and help ensure that healthcare providers and patients obtain the necessary information from the mammography facility to enable a patient and their healthcare provider to make informed healthcare decisions. FDA also is including categories be added to the list of assessments that facilities are required to use in the mammography report. In addition, FDA is amending its requirements related to the transfer and provision of mammography records, the transfer and provision of personnel records upon request or facility closure, and FDA notification and mammographic records access upon facility closure. \nDescription of Respondents: \nRespondents to this information collection are facilities that perform mammographic examinations and State certification agencies.

Facilities must maintain records of personnel no longer employed by the facility for no less than 24 months from the date of the departure of an employee, and these records must be available for review at the time of any annual inspection occurring during those 24 months. \nAlso, under \u00a7 900.12(a)(4), facilities \nshall provide copies of personnel records to current or former interpreting personnel (physician, radiological technologist and medical physicist) upon their request. We estimate that there are, on average, seven interpreting personnel per facility (approximately 61,467 total). We estimate that 1 percent of these personnel (615 personnel annually) will request the records and that it will take approximately 5 minutes to provide the copies for each request. \nAdditionally, under \u00a7 900.12(a)(4), \nfacilities must provide personnel records to former employees if the former employees communicate their request within 24 months of the date of their departure. If it has been greater than 24 months and the facility has maintained those records, the facility must provide those records to former employees upon request. \nFinally, under \u00a7 900.12(a)(4), before a \nfacility closes or ceases to provide \nmammography services, it will have to make arrangements for personnel to access their MQSA personnel records. This access may be provided by the permanent transfer of these records to the personnel or the transfer of the records to a facility or other entity that will provide access to these records. We estimate that annually 1 percent of the total facilities will close or cease to provide mammography services and that it will take each of the facilities approximately 5 hours to transfer the records. \nMedical records and mammography \nreports\u2014\u00a7 900.12(c)(1) through (4): Section 900.12(c)(1), Contents and terminology, sets forth the requirement \nfor facilities to prepare a written report of the results of each mammographic examination performed under its certificate. Section 900.12(c)(1) requires that the report include patient identifying information, date of examination, facility name and location, the final assessment of findings (or classification as to why no final assessment can be made), name of the IP, and recommendations to the healthcare provider. \nThis final rule includes two \nadditional final assessment categories and an additional classification in the mammography report and also requires an assessment of breast density in the report (\u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(iv) through (vi)). We estimate a one-time burden for facilities to update their existing mammography reports with these new categories. Based on the Eastern Research Group (ERG), Inc.\u2019s report, we believe this will take 23 hours per facility (Refs. 66 and 67). \nUnder the final rule, if the final \nassessment is \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,\u2019\u2019 the facility must provide the report to the healthcare provider, or if the referring healthcare provider is unavailable, to a responsible designee (\u00a7 900.12(c)(3)(ii)) within a specified timeframe. The provision of the report to the healthcare provider was not included in the currently approved information collection burden, OMB control number 0910\u20130309, because it was considered usual and customary practice and was part of the standard of care prior to the implementation of the regulations (see 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2)).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54dfe489-eb81-4911-9af4-1c0cab64ff94": {"__data__": {"id_": "54dfe489-eb81-4911-9af4-1c0cab64ff94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b5ee5f9-95eb-4c42-97fb-566c5ff22299", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "bd48f076c726137efd3700698ef6f4e2eced10119b5cd4df5f9616f8789c0469"}, "2": {"node_id": "68530b88-2ba6-4785-bf36-04a3a2667ca9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "13dcf4467cc68ea7e01ed5e54a8a3b92daae3823e1b00dd73dee0840dafaaa5a"}}, "hash": "dcdea989a93065baf18eaed42046196be909b6e79aecf8bc7eb73fabe3ba5eca", "text": "Provision of the mammography report to healthcare providers continues to be part of the standard of care and remains the usual and customary business practice. \nUnder \u00a7 900.12(c)(2), Communication \nof mammography results to the patients, \nwithin 30 days of the mammographic examination, each facility shall provide each patient a summary of the mammography report written in lay terms. If the final assessment is \u2018\u2018Suspicious\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,\u2019\u2019 the facility shall provide the patient a summary of the mammography report within a specified \ntimeframe (\u00a7 900.12(c)(2)). The summary shall include the name of the patient and name, address, and telephone number of the facility. The requirements for the lay summary to include this information do not result in a change to the currently approved information collection burden for \u00a7 900.12(c)(2). \nSection 900.12(c)(2) also requires \nfacilities to provide an assessment of breast density (as described in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) to (iv)) in the lay summary. We estimate a one-time burden for facilities to update their existing lay summaries with the breast density assessments. Based on the ERG report, we believe this will take 11 hours per facility (Refs. 65 and 66). \nAlso, under \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(ii), each \nfacility that accepts patients who do not have a healthcare provider shall maintain a system for referring such patients to a healthcare provider when clinically indicated. \nThe requirements in \u00a7 900.12(c)(2)(iii) \nand (iv) to provide an explanation of the breast density assessment identified in \u00a7 900.12(c)(1)(vi) are not considered to be \u2018\u2018collections of information\u2019\u2019 because the language is originally supplied by the Federal government for the purpose \nof disclosure to members of the public (5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2)). \nUnder \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i), facilities that \nperform mammograms must maintain mammographic records. The rule requires that facilities implement policies and procedures to minimize the possibility of record loss and requires that records be maintained in the modality in which they were produced. \nUnder \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii), facilities \nshall, upon request by or on behalf of the patient, transfer or release the mammograms and copies of the patient\u2019s reports to a medical institution, a physician or healthcare provider of the patient, or to the patient directly. Under \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(ii) and (iii), facilities must transfer original mammograms (and copies of associated reports) or provide copies of mammograms (and copies of associated reports) within a specified period of time.

Moreover, for digital \nmammograms or digital breast tomosynthesis, the facility must be able to provide the recipient with original digital images electronically if the examination is being transferred for final interpretation. We estimate that approximately one third of patients will request transfer or release of the records and it will take approximately 5 minutes per request. To calculate the estimated number of requests, we use the estimated number of screening mammograms (29,890,141) (Ref. 62) divided by 3. This results in approximately 9,963,380 requests, or an average of 1,135 requests per facility. \nUnder \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(v), before a \nfacility closes or ceases to provide mammography services, it must make arrangements for access by patients and healthcare providers to their mammographic records. Additionally, the facility must notify its accreditation body and certification agency in writing of the arrangements it has made and must make reasonable efforts to notify all affected patients. If a facility ceases to perform mammography but continues to operate as a medical entity, and is able to satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7 900.12(c)(4)(i) through (iv), it may choose to continue to retain the medical records rather than transfer them to another facility, unless such a transfer is requested by, or on behalf of, the patient. We estimate that 1 percent of facilities per year will close and that it will take each facility approximately 32 hours to provide notification and access to the records. \nQuality assurance-mammography \nmedical outcomes audit\u2014\u00a7 900.12(f): Section 900.12(f)(1) requires each facility to establish a system to collect and review outcome data for all mammographic examinations performed, including followup on the disposition of all positive mammograms and correlation of pathology results with the IP\u2019s mammography report. The \nrule clarifies that positive predictive value, cancer detection rate, and recall rate must be collected during this audit. \nAdditional mammography review and \npatient and referring provider notification\u2014\u00a7 900.12(j): Under \n\u00a7 900.12(j)(1), if FDA or the State certification agency believes that mammographic quality at a facility has been compromised and may present a significant risk to human health, the facility must provide clinical images and other relevant information for review by the accreditation body or the State certification agency. \nUnder \u00a7 900.12(j)(2), when FDA has \ndetermined that the quality of mammography performed by the facility poses a significant risk to human health, \na facility may be required to notify all patients who received mammograms at the facility or those patients who are determined to be at risk due to the quality of their mammography, and their referring physicians or healthcare providers, of the deficiencies and resulting potential harm, appropriate remedial measures, and other relevant information. Also under the rule, State certification agencies (along with FDA) may notify patients and their providers if a facility is unable or unwilling to do so. \nWe received several comments related \nto the proposed rule.

An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a \ncollection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. \nX. Federalism \nThe MQSA established minimum \nnational quality standards for \nmammography. The MQSA replaced a patchwork of Federal, State, and private standards with uniform Federal standards designed to ensure that all patients nationwide receive adequate quality mammography services. FDA has worked very closely with State officials in developing the national standards for the MQSA program and has sought and obtained input from States at every step of the process. \nFDA issued final rules implementing \nthe MQSA on October 28, 1997 (\u2018\u2018Quality Mammography Standards,\u2019\u2019 62 FR 55852) and February 6, 2002 (\u2018\u2018State Certification of Mammography Facilities,\u2019\u2019 67 FR 5446). As required by \nExecutive Order 13132 (August 4, 1999), FDA prepared a federalism assessment in this latter final rule and determined that the rule was consistent with the federalism principles expressed in Executive Order 13132 (Ref. 64). \nThis final rule amends, among other \nthings, the requirements in the MQSA for reporting to healthcare providers and patients to ensure that patients receive all necessary information after their mammograms, including an assessment of breast density, while not unduly burdening the mammography facility. \nAlthough certain provisions impact \nFederal-State relations, FDA does not believe that they impose any additional, significant burden on the States. The division of responsibilities between FDA, the States, and State agencies will not change as the regulations will continue to provide for necessary uniformity of minimum national standards and, at the same time, provide maximum flexibility to states administering the States as Certifier program within their State, and State agencies serving as accreditation bodies. \nOn November 4, 2011, FDA convened \na public meeting of the NMQAAC where possible amendments to the MQSA regulations, including breast density reporting, were discussed (Ref. 33). This meeting was open to the public, and time was allotted for public statements on issues of concern in the mammography field. FDA has also met and held teleconferences several times a year with its approved accreditation bodies and State certification agencies to discuss issues of mutual concern. \nThe Agency also has long enjoyed a \ngood relationship with the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:18 Mar 09, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\10MRR2.SGM 10MRR2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ba9fd5c-e6fd-4ab0-aa6c-99f881b4162b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ba9fd5c-e6fd-4ab0-aa6c-99f881b4162b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0fd13041-bfab-43a6-a408-354b1776ff8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "d2f2ffe89c29638c8451ffb91884005f14a9d4607ab3b31e7d1e3757fd46b624"}, "3": {"node_id": "3be50de4-9e52-40f0-8c21-b68d8d8078dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "mammography_quality_standards.pdf"}, "hash": "94c1ab18067f0f60574136397b7abd285bcf3c5dd02e0872c67cf7472b804633"}}, "hash": "ca96948c8a939e16da6008df119b217b80882ea36f092174cda45ebe82e487c4", "text": "15166 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 47 / Friday, March 10, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nInc.

Consultation and Coordination With\nIndian Tribal Governments\nWe have analyzed this rule in \naccordance with the principles set forth in Executive Order 13175. We have determined that the rule does not contain policies that have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. Accordingly, we conclude that the rule does not contain policies that have tribal implications as defined in the Executive Order and, consequently, a tribal summary impact statement is not required. \nXII.

Facilities shall implement policies and procedures to minimize the possibility of loss of these records. The original mammograms must be retained in retrievable form in the mammographic modality in which they were produced. They cannot be produced by copying or digitizing hardcopy originals. \n(ii) Shall upon request by, or on \nbehalf of, the patient, permanently or temporarily transfer the original mammograms and copies of the patient\u2019s reports to a medical institution, a physician or healthcare provider of the patient, or to the patient directly during the time specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. Transfer of the mammograms and mammography reports must take place within 15 calendar days of the facility receiving such request. The transferred mammograms must be in the mammographic modality in which they were produced, and cannot be produced by copying or digitizing hardcopy originals.

For digital mammograms or digital breast tomosynthesis, if the copies are being released for final interpretation purposes, the facility must be able to provide the recipient with digital images electronically; \n(iv) Any fee charged to the patients for \nproviding the services in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall not exceed the documented costs associated with this service; and (v) Before a facility closes or ceases to \nprovide mammography services, it must make arrangements for access by patients and healthcare providers to their mammographic records. This access may be provided by the permanent transfer of mammographic records to the patient or the patient\u2019s healthcare provider or the transfer of the mammographic records to a facility or other entity that will provide access to patients and healthcare providers. Access to the records must be provided by such other facility or entity for the remainder of the time periods specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. If a facility ceases to perform mammography but continues to operate as a medical entity, and is able to satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section, it may choose to continue to retain the medical records rather than transfer them to another facility, unless such a transfer is requested by, or on behalf of, the patient.

Executive Summary A. Purpose \nThe primary purpose of this proposed \nrule is to amend the regulations for the \nMedicare Advantage (Part C), Medicare Cost Plan, and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) programs, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). This proposed rule includes a number of new policies that would improve these programs as well as codify existing Part C and Part D sub- regulatory guidance. This proposed rule would also amend the existing regulations for Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D regarding the standard for an identified overpayment. \nAdditionally, this rule implements \ncertain sections of the following Federal laws related to the Parts C and D programs: \n\u2022The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \nof 2022. \n\u2022The Consolidated Appropriations \nAct (CAA), 2021. \n\u2022The Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of \n2018. \n\u2022The Substance Use-Disorder \nPrevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act of 2018. \nB. Summary of the Major Provisions 1.

The combination of proposed changes includes: (1) requiring plan sponsors to target all core chronic diseases identified by CMS, codifying the current 9 core chronic diseases\n1in \nregulation, and adding HIV/AIDS for a total of 10 core chronic diseases; (2) lowering the maximum number of covered Part D drugs a sponsor may require from 8 to 5 drugs and requiring sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs in their targeting \ncriteria; and (3) revising the methodology for calculating the cost threshold ($4,935 in 2023) to be commensurate with the average annual cost of 5 generic drugs ($1,004 in 2020). The proposed changes would reduce eligibility gaps so that more Part D enrollees with complex drug regimens at increased risk of medication therapy problems would be eligible for MTM services. They would also better align MTM eligibility criteria with statutory goals to reduce medication errors and optimize therapeutic outcomes for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and taking multiple Part D drugs, while maintaining a reasonable cost criterion. \nIn this rule, we are also proposing to \ncodify longstanding CMS guidance that a beneficiary is unable to accept an offer to participate in the comprehensive medication review (CMR) only when the beneficiary is cognitively impaired and cannot make decisions regarding their medical needs. We are also proposing other technical changes to clarify that the CMR must include an interactive consultation that is conducted in real- time, regardless of whether it is done in person or via telehealth. \n3.

However, CMS has learned from oversight activities, enrollee complaints, and stakeholder feedback that enrollees often must make a separate request each time they would like a material in an alternate language or need auxiliary aids or services. \nIn addition, an increasing number of \ndually eligible individuals are enrolled in managed care plans where the same plan covers both Medicare and Medicaid services.

We are also proposing at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(3) and 423.2267(a)(3) to extend this requirement to individualized plans of care for special needs plans. We are also proposing to require that fully integrated dual eligible special needs plans (FIDE SNPs), highly integrated dual eligible special needs plans (HIDE SNPs), and applicable integrated plans (AIPs) as defined at \u00a7 422.561, translate required materials into any languages required by the Medicare translation standard at \u00a7 422.2267(a) plus any additional languages required by the Medicaid translation standard as specified through their Medicaid capitated contracts. \n4. Health Equity in Medicare Advantage \n(MA) (\u00a7\u00a7 422.111 and 422.112) \nCMS is working to achieve policy \ngoals that advance health equity across its programs and pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing health equity for all, including those who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.\n2To \nthat end, we are proposing the following regulatory updates. \nFirst, current regulations require MA \norganizations to ensure that services are provided in a culturally competent manner. The regulation provides examples of populations that may require consideration specific to their needs. In this proposed rule, we propose to further clarify the broad application of our policy. Specifically, we propose to amend the list of populations to include people: (1) with limited English proficiency or reading skills; (2) of ethnic, cultural, racial, or religious minorities; (3) with disabilities; (4) who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other diverse sexual orientations; (5) who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and other diverse gender identities, or people who were born intersex; (6) who live in rural areas and other areas with high levels of deprivation; and (7) otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \nNext, CMS currently provides best \npractices for organizations to use in developing their provider directories, including incorporating non-English languages spoken by each provider and provider/location accessibility for people with physical disabilities. In this rule, we propose to codify these best practices by requiring organizations to include providers\u2019 cultural and linguistic capabilities (including American Sign Language, ASL) in their provider directories. If finalized, this change would improve the quality and usability of provider directories, particularly for non-English speakers, limited English proficient individuals, and enrollees who use ASL. We are also proposing to require organizations to identify certain providers waived to treat patients with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in their provider directories. \nIn addition, as the use of telehealth \nbecomes more prevalent, there is evidence of disparities in telehealth access due in part to low digital health literacy, especially among populations who already experience health disparities. Low digital health literacy is one of the most significant obstacles in achieving telehealth equity, and many older adults with low digital health literacy experience gaps in access to the health care they need. This is concerning for the MA program because its enrollee population includes older adults who are age 65 or older, which is why we are proposing to address the issue by requiring MA organizations to develop and maintain procedures to identify and offer digital health education to enrollees with low digital health literacy to assist with accessing any medically necessary covered telehealth benefits. \nFinally, MA organizations\u2019 existing \nquality improvement (QI) programs are an optimal vehicle to develop and implement strategies and policies designed to reduce disparities in health and health care, and advance equity in the health and health care of MA enrollee populations, especially those \nthat are underserved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbee06bd-5a5d-4282-b74d-7ee7d745a1d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbee06bd-5a5d-4282-b74d-7ee7d745a1d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ad25c38-bdbe-45f0-aecc-ee4f63f434c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3f8765b55aa9f954a1c8f6e9ec92aa39dc5c32d7281d2e7e121275db423b54dc"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e2640f3-fc3b-4411-b12e-19d8e28532e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "88f8dfcf02212ea5af6c21d8ad7cd5e4bbe842067dc916c8c8342f749666aff4"}}, "hash": "18dea516cb9fc569abdab3b67f8800035ce19014fdfec1e3a8169fa74c8dc8c0", "text": "To support these efforts, we propose to require MA organizations to incorporate one or more activities into their overall QI program that reduce disparities in health and health care among their enrollees. MA organizations may implement activities such as improving communication, developing and using linguistically and culturally appropriate materials (to \ndistribute to enrollees or use in communicating with enrollees), hiring bilingual staff, community outreach, or similar activities. We believe adopting this proposed requirement for MA organizations as part of their required QI programs will align with health equity efforts across CMS policies and programs. \n5. Utilization Management \nRequirements: Clarifications of Coverage Criteria for Basic Benefits and Use of Prior Authorization, Additional Continuity of Care Requirements, and Annual Review of Utilization Management Tools (\u00a7\u00a7 422.101, 422.112, 422.137, 422.138, and 422.202) \nIn recent years, CMS has received \nnumerous inquiries regarding MA organizations\u2019 use of prior authorization and its effect on beneficiary access to care. We are proposing several regulatory changes to address these concerns regarding prior authorization. First, we propose that prior authorization policies for coordinated care plans may only be used to confirm the presence of diagnoses or other medical criteria and/or ensure that an item or service is medically necessary based on standards specified in this rule. Second, we propose that an approval granted through prior authorization processes be valid for the duration of the approved course of treatment and that plans provide a minimum 90-day transition period when an enrollee who is currently undergoing treatment switches to a new MA plan. Third, we propose that MA plans must comply with national coverage determinations (NCD), local coverage determinations (LCD), and general coverage and benefit conditions included in Traditional Medicare statutes and regulations as interpreted by CMS. Further, we propose that MA plans cannot deny coverage of a Medicare covered item or service based on internal, proprietary, or external clinical criteria not found in Traditional Medicare coverage policies. We propose that when there is no applicable coverage criteria in Medicare statute, \nregulation, NCD, or LCD, MA organizations may create internal coverage criteria that are based on current evidence in widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature that is made publicly available to CMS, enrollees, and providers. \nFinally, to ensure prior authorization \nis being used appropriately, we propose to require that all MA plans establish a Utilization Management Committee to review all utilization management, including prior authorization, policies \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08054bca-11d3-4958-9aa1-69a30ef2a806": {"__data__": {"id_": "08054bca-11d3-4958-9aa1-69a30ef2a806", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e20e5e6b-cc98-4a07-a691-0f50c4176ee5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f9d4fe5a25e9f7ad46c2cdf8e893c2cf9e1ec359b7a8c415922a9396f7ab4d8c"}, "3": {"node_id": "28c43b6d-4e4b-4fa0-9e5e-d8cfec59923a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d73ee7f10d152240750def733f0e3b97a75c4df4c7d9b2ec2adc77b984bdb3d7"}}, "hash": "f1c0d8a3f62d1400fc0671bcc8271fa3f5d7693ecfe02afc15467aca219f35ab", "text": "79455 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nannually and ensure they are consistent \nwith current, traditional Medicare\u2019s national and local coverage decisions and guidelines.

Enrollee Notification Requirements \nfor Medicare Advantage (MA) Provider Contract Terminations (\u00a7\u00a7 422.111 and 422.2267) \nCMS requires notification to MA \nenrollees when a provider network participation contract terminates. CMS is proposing to revise \u00a7 422.111(e) by establishing specific enrollee notification requirements for no-cause and for-cause provider contract terminations and adding specific and more stringent enrollee notification requirements when primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations occur. CMS is also \nproposing to revise \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) to specify the requirements for the content of the notification to enrollees about a provider contract termination. \n9. Transitional Coverage and Retroactive \nMedicare Part D Coverage for Certain Low-Income Beneficiaries Through the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LI NET) Program (\u00a7\u00a7 423.2500\u2013423.2536) \nCMS has operated the LI NET \ndemonstration since 2010. The LI NET demonstration provides transitional, point-of-sale coverage for low-income beneficiaries who demonstrate an immediate need for prescriptions, but who have not yet enrolled in a Part D plan, or whose enrollment is not yet effective. LI NET also provides retroactive and/or temporary prospective coverage for beneficiaries determined to be eligible for the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) by the Social Security Administration (SSA) or a State. In this proposed rule, we propose regulations to make the LI NET program a permanent part of Medicare Part D, as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). \n10.

Under the proposed rule, an MA organization, Part D sponsor, provider or supplier has identified an overpayment if it has actual knowledge of the existence of the overpayment, or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the overpayment. \n11. Changes to an Approved Part D \nFormulary\u2014Immediate Substitutions (\u00a7\u00a7 423.4, 423.100, 423.104, 423.120, and 423.128) \nCurrent regulations permit Part D \nsponsors to immediately remove from the formulary a brand name drug and substitute its newly released generic \nequivalent. Part D sponsors meeting the requirements can provide notice of specific changes, including direct notice to affected beneficiaries, after they take place; do not need to provide a transition supply of the substituted drug; and can make these changes at any time including in advance of the plan year. Consistent with these requirements, we propose to permit Part D sponsors to immediately substitute: (i) a new interchangeable biological product for its corresponding reference product; (ii) a new unbranded biological product for its corresponding brand name biological product; and (iii) a new authorized generic for its corresponding brand name equivalent. 12. Expanding Eligibility for Low- \nIncome Subsidies (LIS) Under Part D of the Medicare Program (\u00a7\u00a7 423.773 and 423.780) \nSection 11404 of the IRA amended \nsection 1860D\u201314 of the Act to expand eligibility for the full LIS to individuals with incomes up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level (FPL) beginning on or after January 1, 2024. In addition, the IRA allows for individuals to qualify for the full subsidy based on the higher resource requirements currently applicable to the partial LIS group. This change will provide the full LIS subsidy for those who currently qualify for the partial subsidy, and we are proposing to implement this change in this regulation. \nC.

For plan year 2023 and subsequent years, as provided in \u00a7 422.514(d)(2), CMS will not renew a contract with a non-SNP MA plan that has actual enrollment, as determined by CMS using the January enrollment of the current year, consisting of 80 percent or more of enrollees who are entitled to medical assistance under a State plan under Title XIX, unless the MA plan has been active for less than 1 year and has enrollment of 200 or fewer individuals at the time of such determination. \nWe established these contract \nlimitations to address the proliferation and growth of D\u2013SNP look-alikes, which raised concerns related to effective implementation of requirements for D\u2013 SNPs established by section 1859 of the Act (including amendments made by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110\u2013 275) and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115\u2013123)). We adopted the regulation to ensure full implementation of requirements for D\u2013SNPs, such as contracts with State Medicaid agencies; a minimum integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits; care coordination through health risk assessments (HRAs); evidence-based models of care. In addition, we noted how limiting these D\u2013SNP look-alikes would address beneficiary confusion stemming from misleading marketing practices by \nbrokers and agents that misrepresent to dually eligible individuals the characteristics of D\u2013SNP look-alikes. For a more detailed discussion of D\u2013 SNP look-alikes and their impact on the implementation of D\u2013SNP Medicare and Medicaid integration, we direct readers to the June 2020 final rule (85 FR 33805 through 33820) and the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2021 and 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (85 FR 9018 through 9021) (also known as the February 2020 proposed rule). We are proposing amendments to close unforeseen loopholes in the scope of the regulation adopted to prohibit D\u2013SNP look-alikes. \n1. Applying Contracting Limitations for \nD\u2013SNP Look-Alikes to MA Plan Segments \nAs written at \u00a7 422.514(d) and (e), the \ncontracting limitations for D\u2013SNP look- alikes are based on analysis at the MA plan level. Section 1854(h) of the Act authorizes MA organizations to segment an MA plan and apply the uniformity requirements for MA plans at the segment level, provided that the segments are comprised of one or more MA payment areas. As implemented in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2 (defining \u2018\u2018MA plan\u2019\u2019), 422.100(d), 422.254, and 422.262, MA plans may include multiple segments in an MA plan in which different benefit designs, cost-sharing, and premiums are available; bids are submitted at the segment level if an MA plan is segmented and evaluation of compliance with MA requirements is done at the segment level where appropriate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9794d19b-4039-4401-a8ae-e2137cda9fe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9794d19b-4039-4401-a8ae-e2137cda9fe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a369db6a-bd60-4d90-8bf4-3dfe00798683", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "541fa6b5edd2d24709825f7dbbdfbab91da4d28e0a55f88cd4b35e638d6fce9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "91b2c306-02d1-4ec7-9573-520014cfd418", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0d827d886caf19d148b0110e4cea6c4133cc161bdf01c3050300c99a861a8643"}}, "hash": "420e4f8e4f15831dd5a9ca29d74e44b8af7781f037c217d85984ebe22452e5fc", "text": "See \u00a7 422.100(f)(6) providing for evaluation of cost-sharing at the segment level for segmented plans. In effect, each segment of an MA plan is like a plan itself. We discussed in the Medicare Program; Medicare+Choice Program (65 FR 40170, 40204 through 40205) final rule, which appeared in the Federal Register on June 29, 2000 (also known as the June 2000 final rule) how the authority in section 1854(h) of the Act for an MA organization to segment an MA plan has practical implications that are similar to offering multiple plans. One or more segments can be part of the same MA plan even though the Medicare Part C \nbenefits, cost-sharing, premiums, and marketing materials can differ. For example, MA plan benefit package H1234\u2013567 could offer multiple segments distinguished by three additional digits, such as H1234\u2013567\u2013 001, H1234\u2013567\u2013002, and H1234\u2013567\u2013 003. Since adopting \u00a7 422.514(d), we have seen MA plans where a specific segment looks like a D\u2013SNP look-alike and would be subject to the contracting prohibitions in \u00a7 422.514(d) if the segment were treated as an MA plan. As finalized, \u00a7 422.514(d) does not clearly apply to a segment within an MA plan. However, we believe that by applying the D\u2013SNP look-alike contracting limitations only at the MA plan level without applying it to segments of plans, our existing regulation has an unintended and unforeseen loophole through which D\u2013SNP look-alikes could persist, contrary to the stated objectives in our prior rulemaking. \nBased on January 2022 Monthly \nMembership Report (MMR) data, we identified 47 non-SNP MA plans that meet the criteria outlined at \u00a7 422.514(d)(2) when we performed our analysis at the plan level. If we were to apply the \u00a7 422.514(d)(2) criteria at the MA plan segment level, segments of three additional non-SNP MA plans would be identified as D\u2013SNP look- alikes. The segments in those three plans collectively have approximately 3,000 enrollees. While the number of non-SNP MA plans at the segment level is currently small, this number could grow in the future and provide an opportunity for MA organizations to circumvent the D\u2013SNP look-alike contracting limitations at \u00a7 422.514(d). For example, in our analysis of proposed D\u2013SNP look-alike transitions for contract year 2023, two D\u2013SNP look- alikes in contract year 2022 are proposing to transition a combined total of approximately 7,800 D\u2013SNP look- alike enrollees into two new non-SNP MA plan segments, which could create two new D\u2013SNP look-alike segments for contract year 2023. \nWe propose adding a new paragraph \nat 42 CFR 422.514(g) to provide that \u00a7 422.514(d) through (f) apply to segments of the MA plan in the same way that those provisions apply to MA plans. As a result, CMS will not contract with or renew a contract with a plan segment where the MA plan or segment is not a D\u2013SNP and the enrollment thresholds in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) are met. This proposal, to treat a segment of an MA plan as an MA plan, would be consistent with CMS\u2019 annual review of MA plan bids and Medicare cost-sharing, in which each MA plan segment submits a separate bid pricing tool and plan benefit package like an unsegmented MA plan and CMS separately evaluates these submissions for compliance with MA requirements. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01a8188b-dbad-494d-b7af-e6f71ca131d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "01a8188b-dbad-494d-b7af-e6f71ca131d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f507f1c1-ac86-416b-bf1a-0370d9eaf825", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "797bbc6a8cdb99ea6e777a20aa9ee3f807095a849f4eb39696ada8c232ee20e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "31b357e4-4e54-4c26-9504-01ef6bb05851", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8725695bb938c9ca8d3a2aa5f19332f335abc761f87fc2dfaf1ab91050084d16"}}, "hash": "c8d8137c67a03c46f6fa7f55f238e903f7f1e7b86d47c6044ef9d60112472ea7", "text": "79466 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAs discussed in the June 2020 final \nrule, CMS implements the contracting \nprohibition in \u00a7 422.514 at the plan level. Where an MA plan is one of several offered under a single MA contract and the MA organization does not voluntarily non-renew the D\u2013SNP look-alike, CMS will sever the D\u2013SNP look-alike from the overall contract using its authority under \u00a7 422.503(e) to sever a specific MA plan from a contract and terminate the deemed contract for the look-alike plan (85 FR 33812). However, CMS does not currently have clear regulatory authority to sever a segment from an MA plan to terminate a contract that has only a segment of an MA plan. CMS adopted the severability regulation at \u00a7 422.503(e) in the Medicare Program; Establishment of the Medicare+Choice Program interim final rule (63 FR 35103, hereafter known as the June 1998 interim final rule) as part of implementing the statutory authority for MA contracts to cover more than one MA plan. Without amending \u00a7 422.503(e), CMS would need to sever the entire MA plan that has the D\u2013SNP look-alike segment such that other segments in that MA plan would be subject to the contracting prohibition and not renewed under \u00a7 422.514(d) as proposed to be amended here if the MA organization failed to comply with \u00a7 422.514(d). Instead, we propose to amend \u00a7 422.503(e) to allow for CMS to sever a segment from an MA plan and allow the remaining segments of that MA plan to continue along with any other MA plans offered under the same contract. We propose to rely on our authority to adopt MA standards under section 1856(b)(1) of the Act and our authority to adopt additional contract terms when necessary and appropriate, and not inconsistent with the MA statute, under section 1857(e)(1) of the Act. Our primary impetus for this proposal relates to D\u2013SNP look-alikes, but our proposal at \u00a7 422.503(e) is not specific to D\u2013SNP look-alikes; because each segment of an MA plan is like a plan itself, we believe severability should apply similarly at the plan and segment level. We also propose to \namend \u00a7 422.504(a)(19) to adopt a new contract term that MA organizations agree not to segment an MA plan in a way that results in a D\u2013SNP look-alike. In conjunction with the proposed amendments to \u00a7 422.514(g) to apply the prohibitions on contracting with D\u2013SNP look-alikes to segments of an MA plan, the amendments to \u00a7 422.503(e) would allow CMS to eliminate existing D\u2013SNP look-alike segments and the amendments to \u00a7 422.504(a)(19) would allow CMS to prevent new D\u2013SNP look- \nalikes. \n2. Applying Contracting Limitations for \nD\u2013SNP Look-Alikes to Existing MA Plans \nWe identified a second loophole \nduring our analysis of contract year 2023 MA plan bids to identify any new MA plans that meet the contract limitation at \u00a7 422.514(d)(1). An existing (that is, renewing) MA plan that did not meet the criteria in \u00a7 422.514(d)(2) (using January 2022 MMR data as provided in paragraph (e)(3)) projected in its contract year 2023 bid that the MA plan would have 80 percent or higher enrollment of dually eligible individuals in 2023. Because this MA plan is not a new MA plan for contract year 2023, the contract prohibition in \u00a7 422.514(d)(1) did not apply. To prohibit similar situations in the future, we propose to amend \u00a7 422.514(d)(1) to apply it to both new and existing (that is, renewing) MA plans that are not D\u2013 SNPs and submit bids with projected enrollment of 80 percent or more enrollees of the plan\u2019s total enrollment that are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We propose to revise paragraph (d)(1) to provide that CMS does not enter into or renew an MA contract for plan year 2024 and subsequent years when the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) are met. We are proposing to begin this prohibition with 2024 because we expect that 2024 will be the first plan year after the final rule adopting this proposal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31b357e4-4e54-4c26-9504-01ef6bb05851": {"__data__": {"id_": "31b357e4-4e54-4c26-9504-01ef6bb05851", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f507f1c1-ac86-416b-bf1a-0370d9eaf825", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "797bbc6a8cdb99ea6e777a20aa9ee3f807095a849f4eb39696ada8c232ee20e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "01a8188b-dbad-494d-b7af-e6f71ca131d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c8d8137c67a03c46f6fa7f55f238e903f7f1e7b86d47c6044ef9d60112472ea7"}}, "hash": "8725695bb938c9ca8d3a2aa5f19332f335abc761f87fc2dfaf1ab91050084d16", "text": "Pending finalization of this proposal, \u00a7 422.514(d)(1) will continue to prohibit contracts with new MA plans that meet the criteria.

Contract Limitations for D\u2013SNP Look- \nAlikes as a Basis for MA Contract Termination (\u00a7 422.510(a)(4)) \nFinally, we propose an amendment to \n\u00a7 422.510(a)(4), which outlines the bases for termination of an MA contract. Specifically, we propose to add language at \u00a7 422.510(a)(4) to add a new paragraph (a)(4)(xvi) that permits CMS to terminate an MA contract when the MA organization meets the criteria in \u00a7 422.514(d)(1) or (d)(2). This proposed amendment is consistent with how \u00a7 422.514(d) provides that CMS will not enter into or renew an MA contract in certain circumstances. In our view, \u00a7 422.514(d) is sufficient authority for the non-renewal, that is termination, of MA contracts when \u00a7 422.514(d) applies. However, we believe that \nadopting a specific provision in \u00a7 422.510(a)(4) will avoid any inadvertent ambiguity on this topic and make it clear that the procedures outlined in \u00a7 422.510, including notices, timeframes, and appeal rights, apply when CMS does not renew an MA contract based on application of \u00a7 422.514(d). \nB. Part D Special Enrollment Period \nChange Based on CAA Medicare Enrollment Changes (\u00a7 423.38) \nSection 101 of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L 108\u2013173) established a Part D\u2014 Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit program for Medicare-eligible individuals. The MMA added section 1860D\u20131(b)(3)(C) of the Act, which authorized the Secretary to establish Part D special enrollment periods (SEP) for Medicare-eligible individuals to enroll in a Part D plan based on exceptional circumstances\u2014that is, an individual may elect a plan or change his or her current plan election when the individual meets an exceptional condition as determined by the Secretary. \nThe SEPs for exceptional conditions \nwere historically included in our manual instructions rather than through regulation. In 2020, we codified a number of SEPs that we had adopted and implemented through subregulatory guidance as exceptional circumstance SEPs, including the SEP for Individuals Who Enroll in Part B During the Part B General Enrollment Period (GEP) (85 FR 33909). This SEP, as codified at \u00a7 423.38(c)(16), allowed individuals who are not entitled to premium-free Part A and who enroll in Part B during the GEP for Part B (January\u2013March) to enroll in a Part D plan. This SEP begins April 1st and ends June 30th, with a \nPart D plan enrollment effective date of July 1st. This SEP effective date aligns with the entitlement date for Part B for individuals who enroll in Part B during the GEP. \nCurrently, when an individual enrolls \nin Part B during the GEP, their Part B enrollment entitlement date is July 1st, regardless of when during the GEP they enrolled. Division CC, title I, subtitle B, section 120 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) Pub. L 116\u2013260 modified section 1838(a)(2) of the Act, to address the beginning of the entitlement for individuals enrolling during their GEP pursuant to section 1837(e) of the Act. As added by the CAA, section 1838(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act requires that, for an individual who enrolls in Part B during the GEP on or \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58f51806-0181-4a24-8dde-49f26bffa7b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "58f51806-0181-4a24-8dde-49f26bffa7b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8bd325c-50d9-4a94-b8a5-2a06e737c11a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d48cdb87ee364eacb0d20a0f8ca6eebf6933c5f6a72211f6fe38e10ddca173b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c9cdb61-9a42-4453-8f27-93cc83c805b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ba7a7a297c51b90c273d8ab610f9dcc8743420cdae94e30b9e950db4c53e4fe4"}}, "hash": "79555fbd31aa247fe5271dfa33f7dd895ca6e4984478e301b5755242fee23c79", "text": "79467 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nafter January 1, 2023, entitlement begins \nthe first day of the month following the month in which the individual enrolled. For example, if an individual enrolls in Part B in February 2023 (during the GEP), their Part B coverage will begin on March 1st. \nBased on Medicare enrollment \nstatutory changes made by the CAA described previously, we are proposing to revise the start and end date for the SEP for Individuals Who Enroll in Part B During the Part B GEP to align with the Part B entitlement dates for someone who enrolls in Part B using the GEP that starts January 1, 2023. Accordingly, we are also proposing to revise the effective date of the individual\u2019s Part D plan enrollment, which is always July 1st under the current parameters of this Part D SEP. That is, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 423.38(c)(16) to provide that on or after January 1, 2023, an individual who is not entitled to premium-free Part A and who enrolls in \nPart B during the GEP is eligible to use the SEP for Individuals Who Enroll in Part B During the Part B GEP to request enrollment in a Part D plan, and that this SEP will begin when the individual submits the application for Part B, and will continue for the first 2 months of enrollment in Part B. Further, we propose to modify \u00a7 438.38(c)(16) to provide that where an individual uses this Part D SEP to request enrollment in a Part D plan, the Part D plan enrollment would be effective the first of the month following the month the Part D plan sponsor receives the enrollment request. For example, an individual who enrolls in Part B on February 10th for a Part B entitlement date of March 1st can use the Part D SEP to request enrollment in a Part D plan during the period from February 10th to April 30th. If the individual submitted an enrollment request for a Part D plan on February 10th and the enrollment is accepted, the effective date of their Part D coverage would be March 1st. Note that an individual\u2019s Part D enrollment effective date cannot be prior to the Part A and/or Part B entitlement date, and the individual must also meet other Part D plan eligibility criteria as described in \u00a7 423.30(a). Per current practice, the Part D plan would need to confirm that the individual had enrolled in Part B (or Part B and premium Part A) prior to the individual\u2019s Part D enrollment effective date. The Social Security Administration (SSA) will have to first process the individual\u2019s Part B application and submit that information into SSA systems, which, in turn, would be populated in the CMS enrollment systems, for a Part D plan to have access \nto that entitlement information. \nWe expect this proposed change in \nenrollment and effective dates using this Part D SEP would simplify the enrollment process and reduce the potential for gaps in prescription drug coverage. Also, we believe it will be easier for beneficiaries to understand the effective date of their Medicare coverage using this Part D SEP, as we are proposing that the Part D effective date will be the first of the month following the month the beneficiary submits an enrollment request, which aligns with most Part D enrollment and SEP timeframes. Although the current SEP for Individuals Who Enroll in Part B During the Part B GEP lasts for 3 calendar months, and the proposed timeframe for use of this SEP would be shorter, the proposed timeframe aligns with most of our other Part D SEPs. In addition, this proposed timeframe would provide the individual the opportunity for a Part D plan enrollment effective date that is within 63 days of the Part B entitlement. For individuals who have maintained creditable drug coverage prior to enrolling in Part B, this proposed SEP timeframe will help to ensure that an individual would not incur a Part D late enrollment penalty (LEP). For example, if an individual enrolls in Part B in February and is entitled to Part B effective March 1st, they could enroll in a Part D plan for an effective date of March 1st, April 1st or May 1st, depending on whether the Part D plan sponsor received the enrollment request in February, March or April, respectively. Any of these Part D plan effective dates would provide Part D coverage to an individual who maintained creditable coverage prior to enrolling in Part B in February within the 63-day timeframe to avoid the penalty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c9cdb61-9a42-4453-8f27-93cc83c805b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c9cdb61-9a42-4453-8f27-93cc83c805b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8bd325c-50d9-4a94-b8a5-2a06e737c11a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d48cdb87ee364eacb0d20a0f8ca6eebf6933c5f6a72211f6fe38e10ddca173b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "58f51806-0181-4a24-8dde-49f26bffa7b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "79555fbd31aa247fe5271dfa33f7dd895ca6e4984478e301b5755242fee23c79"}}, "hash": "ba7a7a297c51b90c273d8ab610f9dcc8743420cdae94e30b9e950db4c53e4fe4", "text": "Proposing this exceptional condition SEP also supports President Biden\u2019s April 5, 2022 Executive Order on Continuing to Strengthen Americans\u2019 Access to Affordable, Quality Health Coverage, which, among other things, requires agencies to examine policies or practices that make it easier for all consumers to enroll in and retain coverage, understand their coverage options, and select appropriate coverage, and also examine policies or practices that strengthen benefits and improve access to healthcare providers. \nThis proposal would revise the \ntimeframes for use of the Part D SEP described in \u00a7 423.38(c)(16) based on the change in effective date for GEP enrollments made by section 120 of the CAA.

This authority was originally codified at \u00a7 423.38(c)(8)(ii) (70 FR 4529).

Those who fail to enroll during their IEP may face a lengthy penalty for late enrollment (life-long for Part B) and a potential gap in coverage. Prior to the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) (Pub. L 116\u2013260), CMS did not have broad authority to create SEPs based on exceptional conditions for enrollment into Medicare Parts A and B. However, Division CC, title I, subtitle B, Section 120 of the CAA established section 1837(m) of the Act to authorize the Secretary to establish Part B SEPs for individuals who are eligible to enroll in Medicare and meet such exceptional conditions as the Secretary provides. Per section 1818(c) of the Act, the provisions of section 1837 of the Act, excluding subsection (f) thereof, applies to the premium Part A program. This authority to adopt exceptional conditions SEPs for premium Part A and Part B is effective January 1, 2023. The ability to grant SEPs for exceptional conditions is an important tool that will allow CMS to provide relief to individuals who missed an opportunity to enroll in Medicare due to circumstances that were outside of their control, ensure continuous health coverage, and avoid late enrollment penalties on the premium Part A or Part B premiums. CMS finalized new exceptional condition SEPs under section 1837(m) of the Act in 42 CFR 406.27 and 407.23 for Medicare parts A \nand B, respectively, in a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 2022, titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Implementing Certain Provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Revisions to Medicare Enrollment and Eligibility Rules\u2019\u2019 (87 FR 66454). These SEPs would be available to individuals who have missed an enrollment period due to an exceptional condition that is specified in the final rule. Specifically, individuals who miss an IEP, GEP, or another SEP, such as the Group Health Plan SEP, due to a specified exceptional condition, would be eligible to enroll in Medicare premium Part A or Part B using the new SEPs. \nBased on Medicare enrollment \nchanges made by the CAA described previously, we are proposing to add corresponding exceptional condition SEPs for MA and Part D enrollment, as authorized under sections 1851(e)(4)(D) and 1860D\u20131(b)(3)(C) of the Act, to align with the new Medicare premium Part A and B exceptional condition SEPs that CMS has finalized in 42 CFR 406.27 and 407.23.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81f0a1ac-d4e8-4d91-81e4-9d9048b6e66a": {"__data__": {"id_": "81f0a1ac-d4e8-4d91-81e4-9d9048b6e66a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7c706a8-4cb8-4267-8397-65c75291bb7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "854125e949b42589f1c71aef9a061df2991196348940a5fe0428522bf4d2b693"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee6e9bd5-26cf-4655-8b87-3d4589db4875", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c113ed3344b7c50f0ba33f72b2210cab8f1f84da926d559835c57efa07a158be"}}, "hash": "168aa32426598a7d572606646831ded718ae0d90a1d012635ac68cda16cb3951", "text": "These new Medicare Part C and D SEPs would be based on an individual\u2019s use of a Medicare premium Part A or Part B exceptional conditions SEP. That is, individuals who use an exceptional condition SEP to enroll in premium Part A and/or Part B will be provided an opportunity to enroll in a MA or Part D plan, provided that the individual meets applicable eligibility requirements for the plan. \nWe are proposing at \u00a7 422.62(b) to \nredesignate current paragraphs (26) as (27) and add a new paragraph (26) to provide an SEP for individuals to enroll in a MA plan or MA plan that includes Part D benefits (MA\u2013PD plan), when they use a Medicare exceptional condition SEP to enroll in premium Part A and/or Part B. We are also proposing at \u00a7 423.38(c) to redesignate current paragraph (34) as (35) and add new paragraph (34) to provide an SEP for individuals to enroll in a stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan (PDP) when they use a Medicare exceptional condition SEP to enroll in premium Part A or Part B. \nThe proposed new MA SEP would \nbegin when the individual submits the application for premium Part A and Part \nB, or only Part B, and would continue for the first 2 months of enrollment in Part A (premium or premium-free) and Part B. Similarly, the proposed new Part D SEP would begin when the individual submits their premium Part A or Part B application and would continue for the first 2 months of enrollment in premium Part A or Part B. The MA or Part D plan enrollment would be effective the first \nof the month following the month the MA or Part D plan receives the enrollment request. For example, an individual who enrolls in premium Part A or Part B using an exceptional conditions SEP, as codified in 42 CFR 406.27 and 407.23, on July 10th for an entitlement ate of August 1st, can use the MA or Part D exceptional circumstance SEP to request enrollment in a MA or Part D plan during the period from July 10th to September 30th. If the individual submitted an enrollment request for an MA or Part D plan on July 10th and the enrollment is accepted, the effective date of their MA or Part D coverage would be August 1st. \nAn individual\u2019s MA or Part D plan \nenrollment effective date cannot be prior to the Part A and/or Part B enrollment date, and the individual must also meet other MA or Part D plan eligibility criteria as described in \u00a7\u00a7 422.50(a) or 423.30(a), respectively, in order to use the new MA or Part D SEP we are proposing. Per current practice, the MA or Part D plan would need to confirm that the individual had enrolled in premium Part A and/or Part B, as applicable, using one of the new SEPs for exceptional conditions prior to the individual\u2019s MA or Part D enrollment effective date. The SSA will have to first process the individual\u2019s premium Part A and/or Part B application and submit that information into SSA systems, which, in turn, would be populated in the CMS enrollment systems, for an MA or Part D plan to have access to that enrollment information. \nProviding an opportunity for Part D \nenrollment at the time of Medicare premium Part A or Part B enrollment using an exceptional condition SEP will help ensure that an individual will have timely access to Part D drugs, within the timeframe of 63 days\n3established in \nregulation at \u00a7 423.46(a), to prevent a Part D late enrollment penalty from being assessed. For example, if an \nindividual enrolls in premium Part A or Part B using an exceptional condition SEP in July and is entitled to premium Part A and/or Part B effective August 1st, they could enroll in a Part D plan \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3917b25-e9bc-44a2-904c-9396d06416a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3917b25-e9bc-44a2-904c-9396d06416a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ffb0eee-084e-40b1-a147-d73c3a795727", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "073a13f0d1fdedddf764c76467c9d3ef56895383df40dacbf4924aa0a0d61135"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5ac6754-8f71-40d3-a9b4-aec45e391081", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c7831f1d2006da9b15b423a9092f2feefa10d048e253ead62e43815478fa3d21"}}, "hash": "46f8f5d8e9110f8107888b91e351aaee613955a6bb44f5ca3bc53f722bc3fa9c", "text": "79469 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nfor an effective date of August 1st, \nSeptember 1st, or October 1st, depending on whether the Part D plan sponsor received the enrollment request in July, August, or September respectively. Any of these Part D plan effective dates would provide an individual with Part D coverage within the 63-day timeframe of Medicare eligibility to avoid the penalty. This is an important beneficiary protection, especially for those individuals who have to bear the cost of paying a premium for Part A. \nThis proposed MA exceptional \ncondition SEP will allow beneficiaries who are enrolled in premium Part A and in Part B to exercise their option to receive their healthcare from an MA plan, instead of Original Medicare, as soon as the individual is enrolled in both Parts A and B, without waiting for the annual coordinated election period. Proposing exceptional condition SEPs for MA and Part D also supports President Biden\u2019s April 5, 2022 E.O. on Continuing to Strengthen Americans\u2019 Access to Affordable, Quality Health Coverage, which, among other things, requires agencies to examine policies or practices that make it easier for all consumers to enroll in and retain coverage, understand their coverage options, and select appropriate coverage, and also examine policies or practices that strengthen benefits and improve access to healthcare providers. \nBecause an individual may elect an \nMA or Part D plan only during an election period, MA organizations and Part D sponsors already have procedures in place to determine the election period(s) for which an applicant is eligible. Our proposal would not add to existing enrollment processes, so we believe any burden associated with this aspect of enrollment processing would remain unchanged from the current practice, and would not impose any new requirements or burden. \nConsequently, this provision will not \nhave added impact. All burden impacts of these provisions have already been accounted for under OMB control number 0938\u20131378 (CMS\u201310718). We do not believe the proposed changes will adversely impact individuals requesting enrollment in Medicare plans, the plans themselves, or their current enrollees. Similarly, we do not believe the proposed changes would have any impact to the Medicare Trust Funds. D. Transitional Coverage and \nRetroactive Medicare Part D Coverage for Certain Low-Income Beneficiaries Through the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LI NET) Program (\u00a7\u00a7 423.2500 through 423.2536) \n1. Background on the LI NET \nDemonstration and Introduction to the Proposals \na. Background on the LI NET \nDemonstration \nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective on January 1, 2006. Prior to 2006, beneficiaries who were eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligible) received prescription drug benefits through Medicaid. When the MMA went into effect, dual eligible beneficiaries began receiving their prescription drug benefits through Medicare Part D. \nFrom the beginning of Part D, CMS \nrecognized the need to provide both immediate and retroactive coverage for full benefit dual eligible (FBDE) beneficiaries who were newly identified by either CMS or a State. Prior to 2010, CMS automatically enrolled newly identified beneficiaries eligible for the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) into a Part D plan with a premium at or below the low-income benchmark (\u2018\u2018benchmark\u2019\u2019 plans), which have no or reduced premiums for LIS-eligible beneficiaries. Each benchmark plan receiving these beneficiaries was required to grant retroactive coverage to the beginning of a beneficiary\u2019s LIS- eligible status or their last uncovered month, whichever date was later. At the time, there were around 300 Part D benchmark plans, and each needed to develop the capacity to provide transitional and retroactive coverage for these beneficiaries. Conducting retroactive claims adjudication and providing point-of-sale coverage was not efficient for Part D sponsors and accordingly, in 2010, CMS established the Medicare Part D Demonstration for Retroactive and Point of Sale Coverage for Certain Low-Income Beneficiaries, also known as Medicare\u2019s Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LI NET demonstration). The LI NET demonstration consolidates administration of transitional and retroactive Part D coverage for eligible beneficiaries to a single Part D sponsor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5ac6754-8f71-40d3-a9b4-aec45e391081": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5ac6754-8f71-40d3-a9b4-aec45e391081", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ffb0eee-084e-40b1-a147-d73c3a795727", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "073a13f0d1fdedddf764c76467c9d3ef56895383df40dacbf4924aa0a0d61135"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3917b25-e9bc-44a2-904c-9396d06416a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "46f8f5d8e9110f8107888b91e351aaee613955a6bb44f5ca3bc53f722bc3fa9c"}}, "hash": "c7831f1d2006da9b15b423a9092f2feefa10d048e253ead62e43815478fa3d21", "text": "Part D coverage under the LI NET \ndemonstration differs from coverage under traditional Part D plans in that the LI NET demonstration provides point-of-sale coverage for beneficiaries who demonstrate an immediate need for \nprescriptions, and also provides retroactive and/or temporary coverage for beneficiaries determined to be eligible, or likely to be eligible, for the Part D LIS by the Social Security Administration (SSA) or a State. The LI NET demonstration provides temporary, transitional Part D prescription drug coverage for LIS-eligible beneficiaries, including beneficiaries who are eligible for the Part D LIS but who are not yet enrolled in a Part D drug plan, or are enrolled in a plan but for whom coverage has not yet taken effect. \nThe purposes of the demonstration \nare to provide the following: \n\u2022More efficient prescription drug \ncoverage and claims reimbursement for newly eligible low-income beneficiaries, including periods of retroactive eligibility; \n\u2022More efficient prescription drug \ncoverage and claims reimbursement for \nindividuals who are not enrolled in a PDP and whose LIS status is not yet established in CMS\u2019 systems, but who arrive at a pharmacy with an immediate need for their prescription. This may occur, for instance, when a State has determined that a beneficiary is eligible for Medicaid but that information does not yet appear in CMS\u2019 systems; \n\u2022A seamless transition for LIS- \neligible beneficiaries from LI NET into a qualifying PDP with basic prescription drug coverage absent a beneficiary\u2019s choice otherwise; and \n\u2022More efficient prescription drug \ncoverage and claims reimbursement for LIS-eligible beneficiaries who are losing existing coverage in a PDP. For example, a beneficiary could be terminated for moving out of the service area of their current PDP. The beneficiary would be automatically enrolled into LI NET for that month and the following month, with enrollment into a qualifying PDP with basic prescription drug coverage that would become effective at the end of the LI NET enrollment absent the beneficiary\u2019s choice otherwise. \nb.

This directive in \nsection 118 of the CAA makes LI NET a permanent program within Part D, beginning in 2024. \nThe proposed rulemaking to establish \nthe LI NET program is consistent with President Biden\u2019s Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government (January 20, 2021) and Executive Order 14085 on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government (December 13, 2021). LI NET ensures that low-income beneficiaries transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare do not experience a gap in coverage for their prescription medications. Executive Order 14085 calls for the Federal Government to design and deliver services with \u2018\u2018a focus on the actual experience of the people whom it is meant to serve\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018deliver services more equitably and effectively, especially for those who have been historically underserved.\u2019\u2019 We have designed the proposed LI NET program with beneficiary needs foremost in mind, ensuring continuous drug coverage and access for eligible low-income individuals. \nLI NET policies, infrastructure, and \noperations have evolved over the past 12 years to balance providing needed coverage with responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars and efficiency in administering the program. The LI NET demonstration has proven successful in providing low-income individuals transitional Part D coverage. Approximately 8 million low-income individuals received the benefits of the LI NET program under the demonstration, with over 100,000 beneficiaries enrolled in LI NET in any given month. It has become a program that beneficiary advocacy groups rely on when supporting low-income individuals and connecting them with services. LI NET works directly with over a dozen advocacy groups and 51 State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs), which collectively work with LIS beneficiaries to remove access barriers and provide health insurance counseling. \nWe believe the LI NET demonstration \nhas become a reliable, stable program that has been successful in providing \ntransitional and retroactive Part D coverage to millions of beneficiaries. In developing our proposals for implementing the permanent LI NET program, we have taken into consideration our experience under the LI NET demonstration. Where appropriate, we discuss the policies and practices under the LI NET demonstration that inform our proposals for how to implement aspects of the LI NET program that are not directly specified by the statute. \nWe rely on the premise that Part D \nregulations apply to the LI NET program and to the LI NET sponsor as part of the Part D program and as a type of Part D sponsor, except for when the statute requires us to deviate or when existing regulations would not apply. For example, as discussed further in this proposed rule, because the LI NET sponsor is required to have an open formulary, existing Part D requirements on formulary development would not be applicable. \nOur proposals to make LI NET a \npermanent program start with \u00a7 423.2500. In \u00a7 423.2500(a), we propose the basis of the LI NET program would be based on section 1860D\u201314 of the Act. We propose in \u00a7 423.2500(b) the scope of the LI NET program, which would begin no later than January 1, 2024. Under this program, eligible individuals would be provided transitional coverage for part D drugs. Section \u00a7 423.2504 sets forth the LI NET eligibility and enrollment proposals and \u00a7 423.2508 proposes LI NET benefits and beneficiary protections. Next, we propose in \u00a7 423.2512 the requirements to be an LI NET sponsor and \u00a7 423.2516 proposes how the Part D sponsor administering LI NET in partnership with CMS will be selected and the requirements set forth in the LI NET contract to provide services and coverage. Section 423.2518 provides a proposal for intermediate sanctions in the event of contract violations. Section 423.2520 proposes how an LI NET contract would be non-renewed or terminated. Section 423.2524 lays out our proposals for bidding and determining the LI NET payment rate. Finally, \u00a7 423.2536 enumerates the Part D requirements we propose waiving for LI NET. \nWe propose to align sunsetting the \ndemonstration seamlessly with the start of the LI NET program under this section. Specifically, the LI NET demonstration would continue to operate until December 31, 2023, and the LI NET program would start to operate on January 1, 2024 according to the regulations that we finalize. \n2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfd57532-2c0b-4ffb-9ebf-eb0f244ce320": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfd57532-2c0b-4ffb-9ebf-eb0f244ce320", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb3c12bf-1f18-4b96-8499-68aa5043e973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4fa2e63a6e767f76c7d65f6605bc76c78fa69f64dc2e8a5b6c746d0f547e8b4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "b87f7644-9472-45d4-b02a-d4e6409b8f6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9db914362a2a587f7fa826f4c95a576055884c6a74c50a872a503a2563213755"}}, "hash": "a99a264faca89413ef90d41dc243d76444e7f9826315cd45611c82a723a93a41", "text": "2.

We propose to establish in paragraph (a) of new \u00a7 423.2504 two categories of individuals eligible to enroll in LI NET that encompass the previously noted categories of low-income individuals recognized by Part D. The first category, which we term \u2018\u2018LIS-eligible\u2019\u2019 in proposed paragraph (a)(1), would be composed of individuals whose low- income status has been confirmed either through CMS\u2019s data in our system of record or because the individual can demonstrate their current or future low- income status. The second category, which we term \u2018\u2018immediate need\u2019\u2019 in proposed paragraph (a)(2), would consist of individuals whose low- income status has not been confirmed, because CMS\u2019s data do not yet reflect the individual\u2019s low-income status, but the individual has indicated that they are eligible for the LIS. \nWe refer to the individuals in the \ncategory established in proposed paragraph (a)(2) as \u2018\u2018immediate need\u2019\u2019 because they present at a pharmacy or to the LI NET sponsor in immediate need of a prescription and have no Part D coverage. Ideally, these beneficiaries would be able to show documentation of their pending LIS status, such as a letter received from the State showing the beneficiary\u2019s LIS status.

This is because our experience in the demonstration is that 80 percent of immediate need individuals do have their eligibility confirmed,\n4and we \nwould not want to turn away these individuals who imminently require access to their prescription drugs. Under the LI NET demonstration, individuals can indicate the likelihood of their low- income status by providing the evidence they have, which can include verbal explanations of why they consider themselves eligible. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2504(a)(2) to \ngrant immediate access to covered Part D drugs at the point-of-sale for individuals whose eligibility as defined at \u00a7 423.773 cannot be confirmed at the point-of-sale.

This is the same as current practice under the LI NET demonstration. We solicit comment on the proposal to align the 2 months of enrollment with the ability to fill prescriptions for these immediate need beneficiaries. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2504(a)(2)(i) that \nimmediate need beneficiaries whose eligibility cannot be confirmed can \ncontinue to fill prescriptions throughout their 2-month enrollment in LI NET. We believe this ensures access to LI NET benefits and is an administratively simple approach as compared with alternative ideas, such as the approach under the demonstration of keeping immediate need beneficiaries with uncertain eligibility enrolled in LI NET but unable to fill prescriptions. We propose in \u00a7 423.2504(a)(2)(ii) that if, by the end of an immediate need individual\u2019s enrollment in LI NET, neither CMS\u2019s systems nor the beneficiary\u2019s provision of documentation confirms low-income status, then that individual would not be auto-enrolled into a qualifying standalone Part D plan following their LI NET coverage. \nb. Enrollment \nSection 1860D\u201314(e) of the Act does \nnot specify a process for enrollment into \nthe LI NET program. Therefore, in forming our proposed enrollment process, we look to the process used in the demonstration. Under the LI NET demonstration, there are four ways for eligible individuals to be enrolled into the demonstration. They are as follows: \nAutomatic enrollment. Individuals \nwho are LIS-eligible but do not yet have \nPart D coverage, and those individuals who have selected a Part D plan but whose enrollment has not taken effect, are enrolled by CMS into the LI NET demonstration unless the beneficiary has affirmatively declined enrollment in Part D. \nPoint of sale enrollment.

The majority of LI NET beneficiaries \nare enrolled into the LI NET \ndemonstration automatically by CMS; about 90 to 95 percent of LI NET beneficiaries are those we identify in our systems and enroll into the demonstration. To do this, CMS \u2018\u2018sweeps\u2019\u2019 our data monthly to identify all beneficiaries who are\u2014 \n\u2022Eligible for LIS; \n\u2022Eligible for Part D; \n\u2022Not enrolled in a Part D plan or \nreceiving the Retiree Drug Subsidy \n(RDS) or coverage through Veterans Affairs; \n\u2022Have not opted-out of Part D \nenrollment for any reason (for example, because they declined it); \n\u2022Not incarcerated, are lawfully \npresent in the US, and do not live in another country; and \n\u2022Are not enrolled in a Part C plan \nthat disallows concurrent enrollment in a Part D plan. \nBeneficiaries identified in the \nmonthly sweep are automatically enrolled into the LI NET demonstration for that month and the following month. CMS then prospectively enrolls the beneficiary into a traditional Part D plan, with coverage under that plan taking effect immediately after the LI NET coverage ends. This population of beneficiaries includes those who may be gaining Part D eligibility or LIS status but have not made an election into a Part D plan. \nA smaller number of beneficiaries, \nabout five to ten percent of LI NET beneficiaries, enroll in the LI NET demonstration outside of the sweeps process. Some enroll at the point-of- sale, as described previously. An even smaller number of beneficiaries contact the LI NET sponsor directly to enroll in the LI NET demonstration. Individuals can submit a request for reimbursement to the LI NET sponsor. If the person is LIS-eligible, the LI NET sponsor enrolls them into the LI NET demonstration and reimburses them for out-of-pocket costs during the duration of their retroactive enrollment. As with an individual who is enrolled at the point-of-sale, the start date of LI NET enrollment would be the first of the month the request is received. There may be individuals who do not have an immediate need for medication and believe they are eligible for LI NET. These individuals can fill out an application form, which allows the LI NET sponsor to periodically check their eligibility and enroll them into LI NET if they become eligible. \nConsistent with the enrollment \nprocesses under the demonstration, we propose in \u00a7 423.2504(b) to codify the ways in which individuals can be enrolled into LI NET: auto-enrollment, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46fb74d8-f090-490f-aa7b-5030e48abbda": {"__data__": {"id_": "46fb74d8-f090-490f-aa7b-5030e48abbda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce9db03c-f123-40d8-a5f8-4aee297bd6d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4194478d2e0656084227d5f4e99c7da0d284f47c802e086f9acd268fed366721"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f2423b9-fddc-4035-9c0e-dc4bd1ceb941", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d847d90de29e292691cdcfb0ac37f448d5f4294a17af02e49b5e44c467aa56f0"}}, "hash": "e05500da9632f3a7c7a778fe4cb64f7753a78183266a1c24801cb88d2dc87ab5", "text": "79472 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n5The LI NET demonstration provides an \nexception to the 36-month maximum period of \nretroactive enrollment if there is a Medicaid determination within the last 90 days that confers Medicaid eligibility going back further than 36 months. In these situations, LI NET enrollment under the demonstration goes back to the start of Medicaid eligibility. We are not proposing an exception to the 36-month limit on retroactive coverage in this rulemaking as the statute does not provide for such an exception. point-of-sale for immediate need \nindividuals, direct reimbursement, and LI NET enrollment form. \nIn \u00a7 423.2504(b)(1), we propose that \nindividuals who are LIS-eligible and whose auto-enrollment into a Part D plan (as outlined in \u00a7 423.34(d)(1)) has not taken effect will be automatically enrolled by CMS into the LI NET program unless they have affirmatively declined enrollment in Part D per \u00a7 423.34(e). LIS-eligible beneficiaries who have made the decision to opt out of enrollment in Part D must take a proactive step to contact CMS for us to record that decision in our systems by placing a flag on the beneficiary\u2019s record. Beneficiaries may opt out of Part D enrollment if they have other insurance or do not want to participate as a matter of principle. We assume that a beneficiary who opts out of Part D enrollment would also want to opt out of transitional coverage under the LI NET program. Therefore, proposed \u00a7 423.2504(b)(1) would provide that when a beneficiary affirmatively declines enrollment in Part D per \u00a7 423.34(e), that would also entail opting out of LI NET enrollment. \nIn defining \u2018\u2018transitional coverage\u2019\u2019 for \nLI NET, the statute sets forth requirements for the duration of LI NET coverage under section 1860D\u201314(e)(3). Section 1860D\u201314(e)(3)(A) of the Act establishes that \u2018\u2018immediate access to covered part D drugs at the point of sale during the period that begins on the first day of the month such individual is determined to meet the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection (a)(3)(A) and ends on the date that coverage under a prescription drug plan or MA\u2013PD plan takes effect with respect to such individual.\u2019\u2019 The starting point of enrollment into LI NET for these types of LIS-eligible beneficiaries, whether they are automatically enrolled or immediate need individuals, is required by statute but the duration of time they prospectively remain enrolled in LI NET is not specified. Under the demonstration, we have typically capped non-retroactive coverage in LI NET to 2 months. Consistent with the statute and with our operations under the demonstration, in \u00a7 423.2504(c), we propose that LI NET enrollment begins on the first day of the month an \nindividual is identified as eligible under \u00a7 423.2504 and ends after 2 months. \nSection 1860D\u201314(e)(3)(B) of the Act \nsets a limit on how far back retroactive LI NET coverage can extend. Full- benefit dual eligible individuals (as defined in section 1935(c)(6)) and recipients of supplemental security income (SSI) benefits under title XVI) are eligible for up to 36 months of retroactive coverage. In proposed \n\u00a7 423.2504(c)(2), retroactive LI NET coverage would begin on the date an individual is identified as full-benefit dual or an SSI benefit recipient, or 36 months prior to the date such individual enrolls in (or opts out of) Part D coverage, whichever is later. This duration of time is similar to retroactive coverage under the demonstration, which provides for a maximum retroactive period of 36 months for Full Subsidy LIS eligible individuals.\n5As \nwith LI NET beneficiaries without retroactive coverage, we propose that LI NET coverage would end with enrollment into a Part D plan or opting out of Part D coverage. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2504(d) that \nenrollment in LI NET would end on the date that coverage under Part D takes effect, consistent with section 1860D\u2013 14(e)(3) of the Act.

For example, an individual whom we auto- assign into LI NET starting April 1, 2024 would remain in LI NET for April and May 2024 before being enrolled into an appropriate Part D plan starting June 1, 2024. \nWe provide two beneficiary examples \nto further explain how LI NET enrollment and disenrollment would work under our proposals: \nExample 1: Beneficiary Kristy is a \nfull-benefit dual eligible and arrives at a pharmacy on May 5, 2024, with documentation showing that her LIS application is pending. She would have immediate coverage in LI NET for May and June 2024. If, in the course of adjudicating her LIS application, it is discovered that she was actually LIS- eligible dating back to January 2016, Kristy would be retroactively enrolled in LI NET as of July 1, 2021, which is \nthe later of 36 months prior to the date she is enrolled in a Part D plan or the date she was first LIS eligible (since January 2016 is more than 36 months prior to her Part D plan enrollment, her \nretroactive coverage under LI NET is capped at 36 months prior to such enrollment). Kristy\u2019s LI NET coverage would end June 30, 2024, upon her enrollment into a benchmark PDP starting July 1, 2024, unless she makes the choice to opt-out. \nExample 2: The Social Security \nAdministration notifies CMS in February 2024 that Beneficiary Ravi was eligible for both Medicare and SSI starting in November 2022. CMS provides Ravi retroactive Medicare drug coverage from November 2022, which is the later of 36 months prior to enrollment in a Part D plan or the date Ravi was first LIS eligible, through March 2024. After March 2024, if Ravi does not actively enroll in a plan of their choosing, CMS would randomly enroll them into a benchmark PDP with an April 1, 2024 effective date. \nAs noted previously, our goal in the \nproposals is to match current eligibility and enrollment policy in effect in the demonstration and the Part D program, to the extent the statute permits. We seek comment on whether revised or additional regulations are required to achieve accurate, streamlined, and beneficiary friendly eligibility determinations and enrollment in the LI NET program. \n3. Benefits and Beneficiary Protections \nSection 1860D\u201314(e)(4)(B)(i) of the \nAct requires the LI NET program to \nprovide eligible beneficiaries with access to all Part D drugs under an open formulary. The statute, at clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 1860D\u201314(e)(4)(B) of the Act, also requires the LI NET program to permit all pharmacies that are determined by the Secretary to be in good standing to process claims under the program, and to be consistent with such requirements as the Secretary considers necessary to improve patient safety and ensure appropriate \ndispensing of medication. These requirements are consistent with how the LI NET demonstration has operated, and we propose to codify the requirement that the LI NET program provide access to all Part D drugs under an open formulary in \u00a7 423.2508(a). We propose in \u00a7 423.2508(b) to require the LI NET sponsor to permit all pharmacies that CMS determines to be in good standing to process claims under the program, whether or not the pharmacy is a network or out-of-network (OON) pharmacy for the LI NET sponsor.

We draw upon our experience under the demonstration to propose cost sharing and appeals policy for LI NET in sections \u00a7 423.2508(d) and (e), respectively. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2508(d)(1) that LI \nNET beneficiaries under \u00a7 423.2504(a)(1) (that is, beneficiaries whose LIS-eligibility is established and who have not yet enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA\u2013PD plan, or who have enrolled in a prescription drug or MA\u2013PD plan but coverage under such plan has not yet taken effect) would pay the applicable cost sharing for their low-income category as established in the yearly Announcement of Calendar Year Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies (the Rate Announcement publication specified in \u00a7 422.312). Under the demonstration, LI NET beneficiaries pay the reduced cost- sharing aligned with the LIS categories defined in the Part D program. Because there is already the existing statutory requirement for CMS to update the parameters for the LIS benefit each year using statutory indexing methods, and because CMS and pharmacy systems are already set up to reflect the appropriate cost-sharing based on the LIS category of the individual, we believe it is reasonable to calculate and charge cost- sharing in alignment with the Part D LIS categories. For immediate need beneficiaries, we propose in \u00a7 423.2508(d)(2) these individuals would by default pay the cost-sharing associated with the category of non- institutionalized FBDE individuals with incomes above 100 percent of the Federal poverty level and full-subsidy- non-FBDE individuals (that is, Category Code 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1ed9310-ff93-4da9-868a-2e4cfc266d19": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1ed9310-ff93-4da9-868a-2e4cfc266d19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "128945a2-fdde-476f-9e11-772c78307cf5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3f32453d9cc2d581093ae3e85936dbf71ebe609415a12623590e6bad3aa6f641"}, "2": {"node_id": "2df537c2-2cd1-4a6d-bbac-600f02171a4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c4ed1a7f75749cd7e9c5d7ee9be60ebd8dc863c246330856039161eea2f2b725"}}, "hash": "030fa5a6e82115bfdc1c50d99a6128fd8ebcbb7464595dfab6304d9d01781f56", "text": "Of the four LIS eligibility categories, this category has the highest level of cost-sharing. Proposed \u00a7 423.2508(d)(2) would further provide that if the beneficiary is later confirmed to belong to a different LIS category, the beneficiary would be refunded by the LI NET sponsor for the difference between the cost sharing they paid versus what they would have paid in their confirmed LIS category. This approach allows for the least government liability for individuals whose LIS eligibility is unable to be confirmed while still allowing prescription drug access for immediate need individuals. We propose in \u00a7 423.2508(e) that LI \nNET enrollees have rights with respect \nto Part D grievances, coverage determinations, and appeals processes set out in subpart M of the Part D regulations. The established processes would adequately adjudicate LI NET beneficiary concerns. This approach of using existing processes avoids needing to devote resources to establishing separate grievance, coverage determinations. Furthermore, consistency with other Part D contracts as it relates to grievances, coverage determinations, and appeals would be simplest for LI NET sponsors. \n4. LI NET Sponsor Requirements \nSection 1860D\u201314(e)(4)(A) of the Act \nspecifies that, as determined \nappropriate by the Secretary, the LI NET program is to be administered through a contract with a single administrator. Since the beginning of the demonstration, CMS has had one Part D sponsor serve as the sole contractor for administering the program. We have found that this approach supports our goal of administrative simplicity by making it unnecessary for each individual plan sponsor to check eligibility and conduct a retroactive \nenrollment/reimbursement process. In our experience, the benefits of having a single Part D sponsor administer LI NET include the following: \n\u2022Providing a single point of contact \nfor beneficiaries and pharmacies attempting to have their claims paid. \n\u2022Providing a single point of contact \nfor State Medicaid agencies submitting Medicaid eligibility and attempting to reconcile and coordinate claims. \n\u2022Simplifying the filing of retroactive \nbeneficiary claims. \nThere may be circumstances in which \nCMS may want to consider contracting with more than one Part D sponsor to administer LI NET. Though we have had stability in LI NET in terms of only having the single LI NET sponsor for the duration of the demonstration, we recognize the need for some protections should it become necessary for another entity to take over as LI NET sponsor and assume responsibility for providing LI NET coverage. The downside of consolidating LI NET functions into a single sponsor is the potential for beneficiary impact should there be a reason that the single LI NET sponsor no longer continues its functions. We believe that this potential of beneficiary impact is mitigated by our proposals to non-renew or terminate the LI NET contract, which are discussed in greater detail in section II.D.5. of this proposed rule, titled \u2018\u2018Contractor Selection and Contracting Guidelines.\u2019\u2019 Accordingly, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18585f32-9242-4002-bd1a-fc729c29e284": {"__data__": {"id_": "18585f32-9242-4002-bd1a-fc729c29e284", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a5eaa06-6ede-48ff-95b4-0ac41e13e41b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "92b8d25ca65a7109d0d6c9fbf6af97037065eb6dc35705967d10982d4ae668c9"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f09d317-6055-42aa-bf7d-030b2e1e189f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "10b734ac37a706dcd03b984c2d13e11ca07c5982962e750d399aa28a65021ba1"}}, "hash": "5130c497f5fbc80f3dc08764299f5389ac9782482c98e8151a01f1164daba572", "text": "79474 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nwhile we propose at new \u00a7 423.2512 \nthat the program will be operated by \u2018\u2018one or more\u2019\u2019 Part D sponsors, we intend to initially continue with the current practice of operating the program through a single sponsor because we determined the benefits outweigh potential beneficiary impacts, which have not come to bear since the start of the demonstration in 2010. \nWe propose to establish at \u00a7 423.2512 \nthe requirements the LI NET sponsor must meet when administering the LI NET program. \n\u2022Because LI NET may enroll \nbeneficiaries from across the nation, we propose to specify at \u00a7 423.2512(a)(1) that the LI NET sponsor(s) would be selected from among the Part D sponsors with a national presence, with an established contracted pharmacy network in all geographic areas of the United States in which LIS is available, which as of the date of this proposed rule is the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Because LIS is not available in the territories, CMS would not require the LI NET sponsor to have network pharmacies in territories. LI NET beneficiaries could still access LI NET benefits while in the territories if needed, however, through out-of- network pharmacies. \n\u2022We find that some experience as a \nPart D sponsor should be a pre-requisite for being an LI NET sponsor, and propose at \u00a7 423.2512(b) that any candidates to be an LI NET sponsor have a minimum of 2 consecutive years contracting with CMS as a Part D sponsor. \n\u2022We propose at \u00a7 423.2512(c) some \ntechnical and operational requirements of the LI NET sponsor. In \u00a7 423.2512(c)(1) and (c)(2) we propose that the LI NET sponsor have the technical capability and the infrastructure to provide immediate, current, and retroactive coverage for LI NET enrollees and the technical capability to develop the infrastructure necessary for verifying Medicaid dual eligibility status for presumed eligible LI \nNET enrollees. In \u00a7 423.2512(c)(3), we propose requiring the LI NET sponsor to identify, develop, and implement outreach plans in consultation with CMS targeting key stakeholders to inform them about the LI NET program. Under the demonstration, CMS enrolls over 90 percent of LI NET beneficiaries into the LI NET plan and we expect CMS would continue to be responsible for most enrollees in a permanent LI NET program. For the beneficiaries who are not auto-enrolled, outreach is important so that stakeholders like the states, SHIPs, and pharmacies to have awareness and knowledge about the LI NET program. Under the demonstration, \nthe LI NET sponsor routinely conducts outreach in consultation with CMS to inform stakeholders about the program. We propose to adopt this approach for the permanent LI NET program. \nAs discussed further in this section of \nthis rule, we propose to waive requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 423.128(d)(2)(ii), 423.128(d)(2)(iii), and 423.128(d)(4). We also propose in \u00a7 423.2512(c)(4) that the LI NET sponsor be required to establish and manage a toll-free customer service telephone line and fax line that can be accessed by pharmacy providers and beneficiaries, or others acting on their behalf, for purposes that include but are not limited to: handling inquiries about services under the LI NET program, providing the status of eligibility or claims, and having the ability to accept documentation for evidence of eligibility. \nReimbursement to beneficiaries with \nretroactive coverage is provided for in section 1860D\u201314(e)(3)(B) of the Act, as the \u2018\u2018amounts that would have been paid under this Part had such individual been enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA\u2013PD plan.\u2019\u2019 This entails establishing a process for beneficiaries to request and receive such reimbursement. In the demonstration we provide a means for beneficiaries who receive retroactive coverage to submit a direct member out-of-pocket reimbursement request for Part D covered drugs for any past month(s) in which they were entitled to retroactive coverage under LI NET. The LI NET sponsor provides reimbursement to eligible beneficiaries based on the submitted cost minus any applicable copayments. Once the LI NET sponsor receives a written reimbursement request, they follow timeframes that are consistent with those Part D sponsors are already accustomed to in \u00a7 423.636(a)(2) when they authorize payment for a benefit due to a reversal in their coverage determination. That is, under the demonstration, the LI NET sponsor has 14 calendar days to reply with whether the claim is eligible for reimbursement, including the reason for denying the request if applicable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f09d317-6055-42aa-bf7d-030b2e1e189f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f09d317-6055-42aa-bf7d-030b2e1e189f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a5eaa06-6ede-48ff-95b4-0ac41e13e41b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "92b8d25ca65a7109d0d6c9fbf6af97037065eb6dc35705967d10982d4ae668c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "18585f32-9242-4002-bd1a-fc729c29e284", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5130c497f5fbc80f3dc08764299f5389ac9782482c98e8151a01f1164daba572"}}, "hash": "10b734ac37a706dcd03b984c2d13e11ca07c5982962e750d399aa28a65021ba1", "text": "If the request for reimbursement is granted, the LI NET sponsor issues the reimbursement no later than 30 days \nafter it determines the claim is eligible for reimbursement. As these timelines have proved workable under the demonstration, we propose in \u00a7 423.2512(c)(5) that the LI NET sponsor meet these deadlines related to direct reimbursement in the permanent LI NET program. \nIn \u00a7 423.2512(c)(6), we propose \nrequiring the LI NET sponsor to adjudicate claims from out-of-network \npharmacies according to the LI NET sponsor\u2019s standard reimbursement for their network pharmacies. As the LI NET sponsor must provide access to all Part D drugs under an open formulary, we believe there is the need for some protection against unreasonably high drug costs for OON claims in LI NET. Other Part D sponsors have the option to deny such claims, or to pay OON claims according to their standard reimbursement for their network pharmacies (with beneficiaries paying any difference between the cost of the OON claim the negotiated price). Because this restraint on unreasonable drug costs borne by the Medicare Trust Funds would not otherwise be present for LI NET, we believe a limit on how much the LI NET sponsor can be reimbursed for OON claims is needed. \n5. Selection of LI NET Sponsor and \nContracting Provisions \nSection 1860D\u201314(e)(6) of the Act \nauthorizes us to implement LI NET without regard to laws relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts of the United States as we may determine to be inconsistent with the furtherance of the purpose of Title XVIII. Thus, CMS is not required to follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or the contracting authority used under the Part D program. Neither is CMS required to contract with every qualified plan sponsor to provide LI NET Part D coverage, as we are required to do for qualified plan sponsors providing non- LI NET Part D coverage. If we followed the same approach for LI NET, we could have many points of contact for beneficiaries and pharmacies attempting to have their retroactive claims paid and multiple points of contact for State Medicaid agencies submitting Medicaid \neligibility and attempting to reconcile and coordinate claims. This approach would not serve the purpose of providing smooth, transitional coverage for Part D drugs for LI NET eligible individuals through the LI NET program, which is a Part D program under Medicare in Title XVIII. \nUsing the authority in section 1860D\u2013 \n14(e)(6) of the Act, we propose to follow the contracting approach set forth in proposed \u00a7 423.2516 to select the LI NET sponsor for the 2024 plan year and onwards. \nIn \u00a7 423.2516(a), we propose that CMS \nwould appoint a Part D sponsor that meets the requirements at \u00a7 423.2512 to serve as the LI NET sponsor.

This circumstance could arise if, for example, CMS needs additional information in any particular year to learn more about a Part D sponsor\u2019s ability to administer the LI NET program. Under the demonstration, there is a multi-year contract approved by the Office of Management and Budget, and each year CMS and the LI NET sponsor have executed an addendum to the contract that included such information as the payment rates and risk corridors as determined in the final bid. As we consider options for establishing regulations to implement the permanent LI NET program, we find it is appropriate that we bring the LI NET contractor into closer alignment with other contracts in the Part D program by executing an LI NET contract with a Part D plan sponsor each plan year that contains, among other information, payment information for that year. Our expectation is that unless circumstances shift to prompt a change, the existing LI NET sponsor would continue in that role in the succeeding year. Therefore, in \u00a7 423.2516(b), we propose selection criteria CMS may use in appointing an LI NET sponsor based on some features of the LI NET program that are related to a Part D sponsor\u2019s ability to successfully administer the program. These are\u2014 \n\u2022Experience covering low-income \nbeneficiaries, including but not limited to enrolling and providing coverage to low-income subsidy individuals as defined in \u00a7 423.34; \n\u2022Pharmacy access as outlined in \n\u00a7 423.120; \n\u2022Past performance consistent with \n\u00a7 423.503(b), including Star Ratings (as \ndetailed in \u00a7 423.186), and previous intermediate sanctions (as detailed in \u00a7 423.750); and \n\u2022Ability to meet the requirements \nlisted in \u00a7 423.505 that are not waived under \u00a7 423.2536. \nAs we are proposing that Part D \nrequirements apply to the LI NET program unless waived, we intend for \u00a7 423.505 to apply to LI NET, with the exception of \u00a7 423.505(k)(6), which we propose to waive in proposed \u00a7 423.2536(g). For example, the contract between the LI NET sponsor and CMS would be required to contain provisions in which the LI NET sponsor agrees to accept new enrollments, make enrollments effective, process voluntary disenrollments, and limit involuntary disenrollments (see \u00a7 423.505(a) and (b)(2)). As another example, consistent with \u00a7 423.505(b)(22), the LI NET contract would be required to include a provision in which the LI NET sponsor agrees to use the CMS complaint \ntracking system to address and resolve complaints received by CMS against the sponsor. Per \u00a7 423.505(k), the LI NET contract would also require the LI NET sponsor to submit certifications of data that determine payment as applicable, such as for enrollment and payment information, claims data, bid submission information, DIR data, and overpayments. The only certification the LI NET sponsor would not submit is the one pertaining to data for price comparison under \u00a7 423.505(k)(6); we believe this certification is unnecessary given that the LI NET plan is not one for which beneficiaries shop and thus would not be comparing against other plan options based on price considerations. We intend to exclude LI NET from Medicare Plan Finder, consistent with past practice under the demonstration. Therefore, it would not make sense to require certification to data for price comparison purposes, and we propose to waive this requirement in \u00a7 423.2536(g). \nIn \u00a7 423.2516(c), we propose that the \nterm of the appointment will be ongoing provided mutual agreement between CMS and the selected party, subject to an annual contracting and bid process (per proposed \u00a7 423.2524(c)) to determine payment rates for the upcoming year. This approach has worked well during the demonstration and we see no reason to propose a different approach for the permanent program. \nIf the LI NET sponsor violates its \ncontract, we propose in \u00a7 423.2518 that CMS would have the authority to impose intermediate sanctions as outlined in subpart O of the Part D regulations, just as we would for any other Part D sponsor. \nIn \u00a7 423.2520(a) we propose that if the \nLI NET sponsor decides for any reason to non-renew its existing contract, it must notify CMS by January 1 of the year before the next contract year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c30fdd45-3f5e-4c70-aab8-19ae38b6c9a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c30fdd45-3f5e-4c70-aab8-19ae38b6c9a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b8fde57-0c8c-4466-be38-200532a46630", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bfc46989df96fd20007eae01adb0bc333c5681cd940d2bc0a7ffa910c4b54fad"}, "2": {"node_id": "070ef0d0-a315-4f30-b035-8ce173bdd9f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6905d917ada65066d6fee14c0c2e6ae2e50bf60994226705bf7732c6284549a9"}}, "hash": "618d950fa173a4178bc15949dde2d5cca21b0c8d78bf3d6e711a589cf72dd3f9", "text": "Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if CMS decides for any reason to non-renew the existing contract with the incumbent LI NET sponsor, CMS would notify the LI NET sponsor by January 1 of the year before the next contract year. We propose that CMS could non-renew for any reason, without cause, and the LI NET sponsor \nwould not have a right to appeal the non-renewal. To provide CMS the authority to non-renew the LI NET contract with that particular sponsor for any reason with no appeal, we propose in \u00a7 423.2536(e) waiving the appeals requirements in Subpart N except for those relevant to a contract termination. As there has only been a single LI NET sponsor for the duration of the demonstration, and we are anticipating a single LI NET sponsor for the permanent LI NET program, we do not want to assume the risk of the appeals process not providing finality by the time an LI NET sponsor would need to begin preparing the LI NET bid. Even if we required the appeals process to be complete by the April timeframe and while the appeal was pending moved forward with selection process, we would be cutting into or needing to forgo entirely the transition time of 3 months we propose in \u00a7 423.2520(b) to ensure seamless transition of the LI NET program. Proposing to assume these risks would not further the purpose of the LI NET program being ready and available to provide immediate, current, and retroactive coverage for LI NET enrollees. We note that non-renewal, whether at the election of CMS or the LI NET sponsor, would not have an impact on the sponsor\u2019s eligibility to be selected as the LI NET sponsor in future years. As discussed in section II.D.4. of this proposed rule, we intend to initially contract with a single Part D sponsor to administer the LI NET program. Unlike beneficiaries in traditional Part D plans, beneficiaries enrolled in LI NET would not have the option of simply choosing to enroll in LI NET under a different sponsor. For these reasons, ample notice is needed if the LI NET sponsor does not intend to continue as the LI NET sponsor in the following year. We anticipate that CMS would be able to provide the same amount of notice to the LI NET sponsor if we were contemplating changing the LI NET sponsor for the following year. A decision to non-renew the LI NET contract with a particular Part D sponsor would not bar or prohibit that sponsor from being considered to be the LI NET sponsor in a future year. Any CMS decisions regarding LI NET sponsor selection would have no bearing on a Part D sponsor proceeding with the application process for other, non-LI NET, Medicare prescription drug plans. \nIn \u00a7 423.2520(b), we propose that after \na notice of non-renewal, CMS would select a successor LI NET sponsor from among the other eligible entities (as detailed in proposed \u00a7 423.2516). Similar to how our multi-year contracts with our contractors require an outgoing contractor to coordinate with any successor contractor during a transition period, proposed \u00a7 423.2520(b) would require the outgoing LI NET sponsor to coordinate with the successor LI NET sponsor appointed by CMS for a period of no less than 3 months to ensure seamless transition for LI NET enrollees, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab2b5aba-3434-4ff7-816c-642ef40a4253": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab2b5aba-3434-4ff7-816c-642ef40a4253", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab667142-330f-4119-9e01-ff04416dc08c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d205b7dd5301c94c31b49d75f6f66996b18063ec33e3eedb277a27ad0a197c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e87f5dd-095c-4ae3-b491-636277a13059", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f6a2096f4a8171dc842b10029abc61c237189ee6b4146c148477b35d7bc852a2"}}, "hash": "0a5faa18b3546c21086f3107344631afff8973d7ff602d559d144cffd44bbc5f", "text": "79476 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nincluding timely transfer of any data or \nfiles.

Referencing portions of CMS\u2019s \nimmediate termination authority in \u00a7 423.509, we propose to establish in \u00a7 423.2520(c) that CMS may terminate the LI NET contract immediately if: \n\u2022CMS determinates that a delay in \ntermination, resulting from non- compliance with the procedures provided in this Part prior to termination, would pose an imminent and serious risk to the health of the individuals enrolled with the LI NET sponsor, per \u00a7 423.509(b)(2)(i)(A); \n\u2022The LI NET sponsor has \nexperienced financial difficulties so severe that its ability to make necessary health services available is impaired to the point of posing an imminent and serious risk to beneficiary health, or otherwise fails to make services available to the extent that such a risk to health exists per \u00a7 423.509(b)(2)(i)(B); or \n\u2022The LI NET sponsor has had one or \nmore of the issues enumerated in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (xii) of \u00a7 423.509. \nProposed \u00a7 423.2520(d) would \nprovide that if CMS intends to terminate the contract under proposed \u00a7 423.2520(c), CMS provides written notice to the LI NET sponsor informing it of its termination appeal rights in accordance with subpart N of this Part. \nWe expect to identify the LI NET \ncontract as X0001, and advance the plan benefit package number by one each year so that we can update the payment rates in our systems for the new payment year. If the LI NET contract with a particular LI NET sponsor is terminated, we would not discontinue use of the contract number X0001. Instead, we would terminate the relationship with that specific LI NET sponsor to provide LI NET coverage, and continue to allow enrollment under contract X0001. \n6. Bidding and Payments to the LI NET \nSponsor \nSection 1860D\u201314(e) of the Act does \nnot specify how CMS is to determine the amounts that it pays to the LI NET sponsor under the contract or how payments are to be made. We propose to establish the methodology and \nformulas that we would use to determine the amounts we pay to the LI NET sponsor under the contract. We use our payment policies under the demonstration, including the bidding requirements, as the basis for the proposed LI NET payment policies in this rule. We do so because LI NET payment activities bear many similarities to those of typical Part D plans, because the infrastructure to pay in this manner is already established, and because we are proposing that the LI NET sponsor must be a Part D sponsor who would be familiar with these payment activities already, in this proposed rule. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2524(a) that CMS \npayments for the LI NET program would be made from the Medicare Prescription Drug Account, as payments are made to other Part D sponsors. \nIn \u00a7 423.2524(b) we propose \nrequirements related to the LI NET bid. Because most of the provisions in Subpart F would not be applicable to LI NET, we propose to waive Subpart F except for those provisions we propose to apply to LI NET. \nSection 423.2524(b)(1) proposes that \nthe submission of LI NET bids and related information will follow the requirements and limitations in Part 423, Subpart F, \u00a7\u00a7 423.265(b), (c), (d)(1), (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(4), (d)(6), and (e). This proposal would require the LI NET sponsor to submit a bid and supplemental information in a format specified by CMS, with the same deadline as other Part D bids of no later than the first Monday of June each year. It also gives CMS the ability to request additional information from the LI NET sponsor to support bid amounts, and the ability to require revisions to the submitted LI NET bid before it is accepted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e87f5dd-095c-4ae3-b491-636277a13059": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e87f5dd-095c-4ae3-b491-636277a13059", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab667142-330f-4119-9e01-ff04416dc08c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d205b7dd5301c94c31b49d75f6f66996b18063ec33e3eedb277a27ad0a197c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab2b5aba-3434-4ff7-816c-642ef40a4253", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0a5faa18b3546c21086f3107344631afff8973d7ff602d559d144cffd44bbc5f"}}, "hash": "f6a2096f4a8171dc842b10029abc61c237189ee6b4146c148477b35d7bc852a2", "text": "As with other Part D bids, a qualified actuary, whether internal or external to the plan sponsor, would certify the LI NET sponsor\u2019s actuarial valuation (which \nmay be prepared by others under the qualified actuary\u2019s direction or review). The qualified actuary would need to be a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2524(b)(2) that \nthe following provisions would apply in the review, negotiation, and approval of the LI NET bid: \u00a7 423.272(a), (b)(1), and (b)(4). This would allow CMS to review the LI NET bid, conduct negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed bid, and approve it only if the bidding LI NET sponsor and the LI NET plan comply with all applicable CMS Part D requirements. As in typical Part D bid reviews, CMS would be able to decline the LI NET bid if it proposes \nsignificant increases in cost sharing (\u00a7 423.272(b)(4)). This approach follows the bid process under the demonstration, in which the LI NET sponsor submits a bid that estimates their costs and includes assumptions for enrollment and utilization based on prior experience. Starting with PY2021, the LI NET sponsor began using an LI NET Bid Pricing Tool (BPT) and accompanying instructions that were adapted from the traditional Part D BPT and instructions. Once the LI NET bid is accepted, we update this information in our systems for the new payment year for the LI NET demonstration. Each year, we advance by one the number designating the current plan benefit package. For example, the contract-PBP was X0001\u2013011 for plan year 2021 and X0001\u2013012 for plan year 2022. \nProposed \u00a7 423.2524(b)(3) specifies \nthe basic rule and major components of the LI NET bid, which are the LI NET sponsor\u2019s estimate of its revenue needs for Payment Rates A and B, which are discussed in greater detail in proposing \u00a7 423.2524(d). \nIn \u00a7 423.2524(c) we propose that CMS \nwould provide advance monthly LI NET payments, on a per-member, per-month (PMPM) basis, equal to the sum of Payment Rates A and B as established in the LI NET sponsor\u2019s approved bid submitted annually under paragraph (b) of this proposed section. Paying on a PMPM basis would align with other Part D payments and with our operations under the LI NET demonstration in which we provide a capitated PMPM amount established by the bid for each beneficiary enrolled in the demonstration. Unlike typical Part D monthly payments, the monthly LI NET payment under the demonstration is a PMPM amount that represents the sum of Payment Rates A and B, as determined by the LI NET bid. The bid represents the LI NET sponsor\u2019s total expected cost, minus any beneficiary co- pays, and with a reasonable margin that represents the LI NET sponsor\u2019s profit. Also, unlike other Part D payments, payments under the LI NET demonstration would not be risk adjusted. Because payments under the LI NET demonstration are cost reconciled (with the exception of risk \ncorridors) and there is no concern about the LI NET sponsor cherry-picking beneficiaries, we use a simpler payment methodology that does not include risk adjustment. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2524(c)(1) that \nPayment Rate A would be a monthly payment for projected administrative costs, constrained by an annual percentage cap set as part of the bid \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bea0b1e5-ee08-4d10-bbdb-696f7620c866": {"__data__": {"id_": "bea0b1e5-ee08-4d10-bbdb-696f7620c866", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51f87ec1-c1ba-42b1-9996-ba776a850fda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c761ead819c7f3e9fc1cde32ced8eecabb28361544028bced0c01b3a1abef94a"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4acb772-f5c4-42e1-b287-4317a4e7088a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a97388dbdd2f07e2455bbd777544ceb46286a0c230bb7e7447162eaae8fb7c64"}}, "hash": "9cbbcfe4ed20156875122ebeba47cc4ebdcad17e94d1982a7030850bfd57545b", "text": "79477 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nreview and negotiation under \n\u00a7 423.272(a). Payment Rate A would include two elements, as it does under the demonstration. The first would be the LI NET sponsor\u2019s estimated administrative costs, which would represent the administrative costs to run the LI NET program inclusive of an amount for the margin, which represents the LI NET sponsor\u2019s profit. The second element in Payment Rate A would be the LI NET sponsor\u2019s estimated costs to pay pharmacy claims for prescriptions filled by immediate need individuals, for which the LI NET sponsor may not be able to submit a prescription drug event (PDE) record to CMS due to the individual\u2019s unconfirmed LIS status. We expect that these are generally the \u2018\u2018immediate need\u2019\u2019 beneficiaries discussed in section II.D.2.a. of this proposed rule (under the heading \u2018\u2018Eligibility and Enrollment\u2019\u2019) who are not confirmed to be LIS- eligible. We propose in \u00a7 423.2524(c)(1)(i) that for the 2024 plan year, the LI NET sponsor includes in its bid the assumption that Payment Rate A cannot exceed a 2 percent increase from the prior year\u2019s Payment A, which is a figure CMS will provide to the LI NET sponsor. For the 2025 plan going forward, we propose in \u00a7 423.2524(c)(1)(ii) the LI NET sponsor will specify their assumption for any increase needed to the prior year\u2019s Payment Rate A, submitting justification to CMS in its bid if the cap exceeds 2 percent. Any proposed increase in Payment Rate A from year-to-year would not be able to exceed the percentage cap. Similar to how CMS determines reasonableness in evaluating a plan\u2019s anticipated profit in the bid, we would use the same reasonableness standard in setting and negotiating the cap on Payment Rate A in the bid. \nIn \u00a7 423.2524(c)(2), we propose that \nPayment Rate B would reflect the projected net costs of the Part D drugs dispensed to individuals who receive the LI NET benefit. Payment Rate B would be the estimated actual drug costs minus direct and indirect remuneration (DIR). In the demonstration, we apply risk corridors to Payment Rate B so that excess gains and losses are shared between CMS and the LI NET sponsor. These risk corridors are symmetrical in sharing upside and downside risk, but are narrower than the risk corridors provided for under section 1860D\u201315(e) of the Act and applicable to other Part D plans. Because the risk corridors in the demonstration are so narrow, the LI NET sponsor has not assumed as much risk for LI NET as traditional Part D plans assume. CMS has not shared risk \non Payment Rate A, in keeping with typical Part D plans for which CMS does not share risk on margin or administrative costs. In 2012, CMS revised the risk corridors under the LI NET demonstration to limit payment adjustments on Payment Rate B. For the portion of a plan\u2019s cost for drugs that is between the target amount and the threshold upper limit (101 percent of the target amount), the LI NET sponsor pays 100 percent of this amount. For the portion of the plan\u2019s cost for drugs that exceeds the threshold upper limit, the government pays 99.9 percent and the plan pays 0.1 percent. Similarly, if a plan\u2019s cost for drugs is between the target amount and the threshold lower limit (99 percent of the target amount), the LI NET sponsor keeps 100 percent of the difference between the drug cost and the target amount. If a plan\u2019s cost for drugs is lower than the threshold lower limit, the government keeps 99.9 percent and the plan keeps 0.1 percent of the difference between the plan\u2019s drug cost and the threshold lower limit. \nBoth under the demonstration and for \nother Part D plans, after a payment year is over and the deadline for submitting payment data for that payment year has passed, we reconcile the payments for the year. This allows us to narrow the gap between what predicted and actual costs were in a given year, as well as share risk with plan sponsor in gains and losses. To provide for payment reconciliation and risk sharing in the LI NET program, we propose in \u00a7 423.2524(d) to establish the payment policies for reconciliation and risk corridors, including adopting targeted provisions of existing risk sharing requirements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4acb772-f5c4-42e1-b287-4317a4e7088a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4acb772-f5c4-42e1-b287-4317a4e7088a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51f87ec1-c1ba-42b1-9996-ba776a850fda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c761ead819c7f3e9fc1cde32ced8eecabb28361544028bced0c01b3a1abef94a"}, "2": {"node_id": "bea0b1e5-ee08-4d10-bbdb-696f7620c866", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9cbbcfe4ed20156875122ebeba47cc4ebdcad17e94d1982a7030850bfd57545b"}}, "hash": "a97388dbdd2f07e2455bbd777544ceb46286a0c230bb7e7447162eaae8fb7c64", "text": "Proposed \u00a7 423.2524(d)(1) provides that CMS would conduct LI NET payment reconciliation each year for Payment Rates A and B after the annual PDE data submission deadline has passed and make the resulting payment adjustment consistent with \u00a7 423.343(a). \nIn \u00a7 423.2524(d)(2), we propose to \nestablish the same risk corridors for Payment Rate B that apply under the demonstration: no risk sharing within 1 percent of the target amount and symmetrical 0.1 percent risk sharing beyond the 1 percent corridor. To carry \nout risk sharing as part of reconciliation, we propose to have \u00a7 423.336(c) apply to LI NET, which requires a plan sponsor to provide necessary cost data information to CMS and authorizes CMS to make either lump-sum payments or adjustments based on the risk corridor calculations. \nProposed \u00a7 423.2524(e) would \nestablish that the LI NET contract is subject to the existing provision at \n\u00a7 423.346 pertaining to payment reopenings. Per \u00a7 423.346, CMS may reopen and revise an initial or reconsidered final payment determination for up to 5 payment years. Under the demonstration, each LI NET reconciliation has been in alignment with \u00a7 423.346 and included the prior 5 years of PDEs. The most recently completed payment year gets reconciled for the first time along with reopening the prior 4 years. For example, in 2019, PBP 008 for payment year 2018 was reconciled for the first time while PBPs 004\u2013007 (for payment years 2014 through 2017) were reopened. Sequestration is not used or accounted for in reconciliation, consistent with how we apply sequestration for other Part D plans. Under the demonstration, we maintain consistency between LI NET\u2019s PDE and DIR reporting deadlines and the reporting deadlines that apply to Part D plans (for example, the yearly deadline for data used for payment year reconciliation is June 30th). Enrollment, risk adjustment, and PDE certifications (attestations) are collected under the LI NET demonstration just like other contracts, and we propose to adopt the requirements in \u00a7 423.505(k)(1) through (5), except for certifying to reinsurance data because LI NET does not receive a reinsurance subsidy. This proposal would require the LI NET sponsor to certify to the accuracy, completeness, and truthfulness of all data related to payment. \nAs noted earlier in this section of this \nproposed rule, as a general matter, all payment rights and responsibilities under Part D that otherwise apply and are not explicitly waived in proposed \u00a7 423.2536 would apply to the LI NET \nprogram, as appropriate. Proposed \u00a7 423.2524(f) would provide that the LI NET sponsor could appeal the payment calculation under \u00a7 423.350. Proposed \u00a7 423.2524(g) would establish that the LI NET contractor is subject to the \u2018\u2018report and return\u2019\u2019 overpayment requirements under \u00a7 423.360. \n7.

Thus, we propose in \u00a7 423.2536(i) to waive subpart W in full for LI NET. \nWe propose in \u00a7 423.2536(j) to waive \nthe MLR requirements in subpart X of Part 423. \nSection 1857 as incorporated into \n1860D\u201314(e) of the Act does not speak to MLR requirements for LI NET. Under the LI NET demonstration, CMS does not require the LI NET sponsor to meet the minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) requirement or to report the MLR for the LI NET contract as it does for other Part D contracts. This is due to the unique payment structure for the contract. Under Part D, a sponsor submits a single bid including estimated administrative costs, returns on investment, and drug costs, which are risk-adjusted. After a payment year concludes, Part D sponsors are required under subpart X of Part 423 to report the MLR for each contract, and if the MLR for a contract is below 85 percent, the sponsor is required to remit payment to CMS. Enrollment sanctions are applied to contracts that fail to meet the minimum MLR requirement for three3 consecutive years, and contracts that fail to meet the requirement for 5 consecutive years are subject to termination. The minimum MLR requirement is intended to create incentives for Part D sponsors to reduce administrative costs such as marketing costs, profits, and other such uses of plan revenues, and to help ensure that taxpayers and enrolled beneficiaries receive value from Medicare health plans. Because of the limits we are proposing to place on how much administrative costs in LI NET under Payment Rate A can increase year over year and because of the differing payment structure, we do not believe MLR reporting should be applicable to LI NET. \nThe Affordable Care Act amended \nsection 1893(h) of the Act to expand the use of Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) to include the MA and Part D programs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65bcf460-b5d7-4b6b-a96f-5cd56627b4c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "65bcf460-b5d7-4b6b-a96f-5cd56627b4c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29b9879e-08c8-4008-8d80-c9d7fdca095f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "995e35c75eac29c1b43b2ab37a83c428368a8cff811d4d0779678de89f9c3388"}, "2": {"node_id": "56d970d4-a95e-43cb-9db6-7d2935518d8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "59e498549b49f4cef8b72f416c9129571a470445d6c0f06585222f9cd31776cf"}}, "hash": "eab662dbdd043892765440ae5c439b49a606428864a20501acbea132a2412d18", "text": "Section 1893(h)(9) of the Act specifies that, under contracts with the Secretary, Part D RACs are required to ensure that each PDP has an anti-fraud plan in effect and to review the effectiveness of each such anti-fraud plan, to examine claims for reinsurance payments to determine whether PDPs submitting such claims incurred costs in excess of the costs allowed, and to review estimates submitted by PDPs with respect to the enrollment of high- cost beneficiaries and compare such estimates with the numbers of such beneficiaries actually enrolled by such plans. Because the LI NET sponsor must enroll every eligible LI NET beneficiary, and because LI NET does not receive reinsurance, a Part D RAC\u2019s review or examination of LI NET claims would likely be extremely limited in scope. As other audit, oversight, and compliance requirements would continue to apply to the LI NET program, the other program integrity safeguards we have proposed for the LI NET program would be adequate, and we therefore propose \nto waive application of the RAC requirements in subpart Z of Part 423. \nIn surveying the items under Part 423 \nfor the Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, we attempted to categorize existing requirements as applicable, inapplicable, or a candidate for waiver. We solicit comment on whether there are additional provisions in part 423 that we have not mentioned in this proposed rule and that we should address for LI NET. \n8. Technical Corrections \nIn the course of this rulemaking, we \nnoticed the need for a technical \ncorrection in \u00a7 423.505(b)(22), which requires Part D sponsors to address and resolve complaints received by CMS against the Part D sponsor. The \nregulation text currently refers to MA organization when it should refer to Part D sponsor, and thus we propose to make the correction. \nWe also propose to make a technical \ncorrection in the header of subpart Z of Part 423. The header in regulation text currently is \u2018\u2018Recovery Audit Contractor Part C Appeals Process\u2019\u2019 when it should be referring to Part D. Thus, we propose to make the technical correction so the header correctly reads, \u2018\u2018Recovery Audit Contractor Part D Appeals Process.\u2019\u2019 \nE. Expanding Eligibility for Low-Income \nSubsidies Under Part D of the Medicare Program (\u00a7\u00a7 423.773 and 423.780) \nThe Part D low income subsidy (LIS) \nhelps people with Medicare who meet certain statutory income and resource criteria pay for prescription drugs and lowers the costs of prescription drug coverage. Individuals who qualify for the full LIS receive assistance to pay their full premiums and deductibles (in certain Part D plans) and have reduced cost sharing. Individuals who qualify for the partial LIS pay reduced premiums (on a sliding scale based on their income) and also have reduced deductibles and cost sharing. \nCurrently, in order to qualify for the \nfull subsidy, an individual must live in 1 of the 50 States or the District of Columbia and meet the income and resource standards established in at section 1860D\u201314(a)(3)(D) of the Act and codified at \u00a7 423.773. To be eligible for the full subsidy, individuals must have countable income below 135 percent of the Federal poverty level (FPL) for the individual\u2019s family size. In addition, an individual must have resources that do not exceed three times the resource limit under section 1613 for applicants for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) under title XVI. The resource limit increases annually by \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f6348d-2c73-4e14-bf40-da472b926091": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f6348d-2c73-4e14-bf40-da472b926091", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2440a9eb-6260-4b57-9b9b-b6f5ce4b83df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3edd08c45d414f2a3295c1a0eace617ebbd4cb46bd477ac63bb2bebbd3d8af59"}, "3": {"node_id": "33fb904a-b839-4883-a3ec-ce64375e2dba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "aa884a550a91848df72be9077529c79b562b985d722b15afe589e0c3c60110cb"}}, "hash": "8338262de08659edcbe69bd762bbf94aae87ae2e4e3f4324864ce06b232d40ed", "text": "79479 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n6https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/ \npresidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order- \nadvancing-racial-equity-and-support-for- underserved-communities-through-the-federal- government/. \n7https://www.cms.gov/cms-strategic-plan. \n8https://www.cms.gov/pillar/health-equity. the percentage increase in the Consumer \nPrice Index (CPI, all items, U.S. city average) as of September for the year before and is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.

Similar to the resource limits for the full subsidy group, these amounts are increased annually by the percentage increase in the CPI as of September for the year before and rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The resource limits for the partial subsidy in 2006 were $10,000 for a beneficiary who was single or $20,000 if the beneficiary was married, and the limits in 2022 are $14,010, if single, or $27,950, if married. \nSection 11404 of the Inflation \nReduction Act (IRA) (Pub. L. 117\u2013169), enacted on August 16, 2022, amended section 1860D\u201314 of the Act to expand eligibility for the full LIS subsidy group to individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the FPL and who meet either the resource standard in paragraph (3)(D) or paragraph (3)(E) of section 1860D\u201314(a) of the Act, beginning on or after January 1, 2024. This change will provide the full LIS subsidy for those who currently qualify for the partial subsidy. \nTo implement the changes to the LIS \nincome requirements, we propose to amend \u00a7 423.773(b)(1) to add that to be eligible for the full subsidy for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, an individual must have an income below 150 percent of the FPL. To coordinate with this change, we are \nalso proposing to amend \u00a7 423.773(d) to specify that the requirement that an individual have an income below 150 percent of the FPL to be eligible for the partial subsidy applies only to plan years beginning before January 1, 2024. This latter change will effectively sunset the partial subsidy income requirements after 2023. \nTo implement the changes to the \nresource limits, we propose to amend \u00a7 423.773 to state that the current resource limits applicable for the full subsidy at paragraph (b)(2)(ii) apply to years 2007 through 2023. We also propose to add a new \u00a7 423.773(b)(2)(iii) to state that for years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, the resource limits at paragraph (d)(2) of \u00a7 423.773\u2014the resource standards currently applicable for the partial subsidy\u2014would apply to full subsidy eligible individuals. \nLastly, we propose to amend \n\u00a7 423.780(d) to specify that the sliding scale premium amounts currently applicable for individuals with the partial subsidy apply with respect to plan years beginning before January 1, 2024. These individuals who have incomes between 135 and 150 percent of the FPL and who meet the resource requirements will now qualify for the full subsidy beginning in 2024, and will be entitled to a premium subsidy of 100 percent of the premium subsidy amount, as outlined in \u00a7 423.780(a). \nIII.

In response, CMS announced its 2022 CMS Strategic Plan, and \u2018\u2018Advance Equity\u2019\u2019 is the first pillar of that Strategic Plan.\n7 \nThis pillar emphasizes the importance of advancing health equity by addressing the health disparities that impact our health system. CMS defines health equity as \u2018\u2018the attainment of the highest level of health for all people, where everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their optimal health regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geography, preferred language, or other factors that affect access to care and health outcomes.\u2019\u2019\n8This is the \ndefinition of health equity that we use for all health equity provisions in this proposed rule. CMS continues to work diligently to \nidentify regulatory actions that can help \nsupport CMS\u2019s goal to advance health equity or that already address health equity topics but should be expanded in order to meet the increasingly diverse needs of enrollees served by MA organizations. In order to support the Administration\u2019s goal of advancing equity for all, it is imperative that we ensure our regulations address topics that enable disadvantaged populations to fully access the care that the regulations already allow them to receive. Consequently, we are proposing several regulatory updates in the MA program related to health equity. These proposals include requirements intended to ensure equitable access to MA services, ensure MA provider directories reflect providers\u2019 cultural and linguistic capabilities and notate MOUD-waivered providers, ensure MA enrollees with low digital health literacy are identified and offered digital health education to assist them in accessing any medically necessary covered telehealth benefits, and ensure MA organizations incorporate one or more activities into their overall quality improvement program that reduce disparities in health and health care among their enrollees. CMS believes that the proposed changes included in this proposed rule would address health disparities in the MA program and could be essential to more broadly supporting other equity-focused efforts across CMS policies and programs. \n2. Ensuring Equitable Access to \nMedicare Advantage (MA) Services (\u00a7 422.112) \nAs discussed extensively in section \nIII.A.1. of this proposed rule, E.O. 13985 describes the Administration\u2019s policy goals to advance equity across the Federal Government. Currently, \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) requires MA organizations that offer coordinated care plans to ensure that services are provided in a culturally competent manner to all enrollees, including those with limited English proficiency or reading skills, and diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. \nAs discussed in the interim final rule \nwith comment period titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Establishment of the Medicare+Choice Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on June 26, 1998 (63 FR 34968, 34989) (the June 1998 IFC), the goal of this regulatory requirement was to ensure that enrollees with limited English proficiency, limited education, or other socioeconomic disadvantages receive the health care to which they are entitled.

CMS later finalized the provision in the final rule titled Medicare Program; Medicare+Choice Program, which appeared in the Federal Register on June 29, 2000 (65 FR 40170) \n(the June 2000 final rule) with a somewhat detailed discussion of the objectives served by this provision (65 FR 40217 through 40218). The principle objective underlying the current requirement to provide services in a culturally competent manner is to address unique racial and ethnically- related health care concerns. However, the regulation explicitly applies to all enrollees and does not include an exception for any enrollees; therefore, this consideration must be part of an MA organization\u2019s work in ensuring that all covered benefits are available and accessible to all enrollees. The regulation applies to \u2018\u2018all enrollees\u2019\u2019 even though specific populations are mentioned as examples of enrollees to whom services must be provided in a culturally competent manner. \nIn the June 2000 final rule (65 FR \n40217), CMS discussed that appropriate care delivery should accommodate the unique health-related beliefs, attitudes, practices, and communication patterns of beneficiaries and their caregivers to improve services, strengthen programs, increase community participation and eliminate disparities in health status among diverse population groups; CMS also emphasized the importance for health care providers and administrative staff to possess a set of attitudes, skills, behaviors, and policies that enables the organization to effectively provide services to diverse population groups. While \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) already applies to all enrollees, CMS believes that amendments to the current regulatory text would better reflect the broad scope of underserved populations that MA organizations must ensure have access to services provided in a culturally competent manner. As the populations that CMS serves become increasingly diverse, it is imperative to keep regulations updated to ensure broad protections are available that minimize the potential for discriminatory barriers, including any electronic tools that use discriminatory algorithms, to surface. Thus, CMS is proposing the following changes and additions to the regulatory language at \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) with an intention to clarify the scope of the existing requirements, consistent with the direction and goals of E.O. 13985. CMS notes that the requirements at \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) were originally codified using our authority in section 1852(d) of the Act (concerning access to services) \nas well as our authority in section 1856(b)(1) of the Act to establish standards under Part C; the intent of this proposal is to update the regulatory language at \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) for clarification purposes rather than to make actual changes in requirements. We continue to rely on sections 1852(d) and 1856(b)(1) of the Act as the basis for \u00a7 422.112, including these changes, consistent with the June 1998 IFC and finalization in a February 1999 final rule (64 FR 7981) of these existing requirements. \nThe current paragraph heading at \n\u00a7 422.112(a)(8), which precedes the existing equitable access provisions, is titled \u2018\u2018Cultural considerations.\u2019\u2019 CMS acknowledges that the term \u2018\u2018cultural considerations\u2019\u2019 could create the misconception that the protections of the provisions apply only to some populations and not others. CMS is proposing to revise this heading to \u2018\u2018Ensuring Equitable Access to Medicare Advantage (MA) Services.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2018equitable access\u2019\u2019 is a broader and more suitable description for the paragraph, as it does not suggest an emphasis on protecting access to care for one population over another. We believe these changes will more clearly reflect the inclusive nature of the protections MA organizations must guarantee for all enrollees under these provisions. \nAdditionally, the current regulatory \nlanguage describes some underserved groups as examples of populations that may require accommodations that are specific to their needs\u2014those with limited English proficiency or reading skills, and diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

These provisions should not be construed to mean that accommodations are required only for enrollees who belong to the groups listed herein. \nCMS believes these clarifications are \nnecessary and are consistent with the Administration\u2019s goal of ensuring equity across Federal programs, consistent with E.O. 13985. CMS welcomes public comment in response to this proposal. \n3. Medicare Advantage (MA) Provider \nDirectories (\u00a7 422.111) \nSection 1852(c)(1) of the Act requires \nan MA organization to disclose, among other things, the number, mix, and distribution of plan providers in a clear, accurate, and standardized form to each enrollee in an MA plan offered by the MA organization at the time of enrollment and at least annually thereafter. We implemented this requirement in a regulation at \u00a7 422.111(a) and (b)(3)(i), requiring that an MA organization must disclose the number, mix, and distribution (addresses) of providers from whom enrollees may reasonably be expected to obtain services, in the manner specified by CMS, to each enrollee electing an MA plan it offers; in a clear, accurate, and standardized form; and at the time of enrollment and at least annually thereafter, by the first day of the annual coordinated election period. In addition, under \u00a7 417.427, the MA disclosure requirements at \u00a7 422.111 also apply to section 1876 cost plans. \nCMS has historically interpreted the \ndisclosure requirement at \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i)\u2014\u2018\u2018the number, mix, and distribution (addresses) of providers from whom enrollees may reasonably be expected to obtain services\u2019\u2019\u2014as referring to the provider directory.

In accordance with \n\u00a7 422.2267(c), when drafting their provider directories based on CMS\u2019s model, organizations must accurately convey the required information and follow the order of content specified by CMS. \nThe current provider directory model \ncontains an array of specific required information based on \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i); we refer to this information collectively as required provider directory data elements. For example, organizations must list only the office or practice location(s) where the provider regularly practices, must clearly identify the capacity in which the provider is serving (that is, specialty type), and must clearly identify whether or not a provider is accepting new patients or provide a notice directing beneficiaries to contact a provider to determine if he or she is accepting new patients. Other examples of required provider directory data elements include up-to-date provider practice names and notations next to providers\u2019 listings indicating any restrictions on access. Several of these data elements are tied to how \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i) requires the organization to disclose information about providers from whom enrollees may reasonably be expected to obtain services; issues of access, including whether the provider is accepting new patients, are integral to whether an enrollee may reasonably be expected to obtain covered services from that provider. In addition, some of these provider directory data elements (for example, restrictions on access notations, accepting new patients indicator) contain important information that organizations should be taking into account to verify that their networks are truly adequate. This enables the organization to ensure that all covered services are available and accessible under the plan, as required by section 1852 of the Act and \u00a7 422.112(a). \nIn addition to the required provider \ndirectory data elements, CMS guidance addresses best practices for provider directories, including encouraging organizations to identify non-English languages spoken by each provider and provider/location accessibility for people with physical disabilities. CMS proposes to codify these two best practices (the latter in terms of deaf or hard of hearing individuals) as a regulatory requirement at \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i). Specifically, we propose to mirror the Medicaid provider directory requirements at \u00a7 438.10(h)(1)(vii) by adding the phrase \n\u2018\u2018each provider\u2019s cultural and linguistic capabilities, including languages (including American Sign Language) \noffered by the provider or a skilled medical interpreter at the provider\u2019s office\u2019\u2019 to paragraph (b)(3)(i). This would change these two best practices to required data elements that all organizations must include in their provider directories. Currently, the Medicaid managed care regulation at \u00a7 438.10(h)(1)(vii) requires that provider directories for Medicaid managed care plans include information on the provider\u2019s cultural and linguistic capabilities, including languages (including American Sign Language (ASL)) offered by the provider or a skilled medical interpreter at the provider\u2019s office as well as other information identifying the provider\u2019s location, contact information, specialty, and other information important for beneficiaries in selecting a healthcare provider.

We are proposing this new requirement for MA provider directories as a standard for \nimplementing and ensuring compliance with section 1852(c)(1)(C) of the Act and as a necessary and appropriate standard to ensure that MA enrollees have the information they need in order to access covered services from an MA plan. \nThis proposal is also consistent with \nthe health equity objectives of CMS\u2019s first strategic pillar \u2018\u2018Advance Equity\u2019\u2019 under the 2022 CMS Strategic Plan.\n12It \nsupports current CMS efforts to advance health equity by giving enrollees a fair and just opportunity to access health care services regardless of preferred language. Please refer to sections III.A.1. and III.A.2. of this proposed rule for more extensive discussion of health equity issues in the MA program. \nTo further enhance our requirements \nfor MA provider directories in the area of behavioral health, we also propose to add a new required provider directory data element for certain providers who offer medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Access to MOUD can be life-saving, but too often, patients do not know how to access this type of care. MA enrollees may have little insight as to which providers can provide MOUD. This problem is especially urgent, as overdose deaths from opioids have skyrocketed during the COVID\u201319 pandemic.\n13Therefore, \nwe propose to require organizations to identify certain providers in their provider directories who have obtained a waiver under section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 823(g)(2)(B)(i)\u2013(ii)) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to treat patients with MOUD (for example, methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, naloxone, or Suboxone) and who are listed on SAMHSA\u2019s \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd32c7d-bdd7-46fb-8a20-3fd65f3b4f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd32c7d-bdd7-46fb-8a20-3fd65f3b4f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "56c2f6b6-bdfa-4f6c-96d9-00a437833d4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4cc9fa5a609fa6a23242dc93e657e4cbe9b9e0758985bf60876944fe21dbef4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6a8430b-d9a7-4709-afc5-4c3e77cf9b1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5b6178f538c778ba9397a07359333ac96ac32a474d1ba43b5cc676ca1e4a8120"}}, "hash": "f6aa011e62ae227ede27cbe014ab090a10daee4ee1c95712e308a1144719c0c8", "text": "79482 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n14https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- \ntreatment/find-treatment/treatment-practitioner- \nlocator. \n15https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- \ntreatment/find-treatment/treatment-practitioner- locator. \n16https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- \ntreatment/become-buprenorphine-waivered- practitioner.

This proposed change to the content requirements for provider directories would allow MA enrollees to use their provider directories to search for the providers that have special training to provide MOUD and are allowed to administer, dispense, or prescribe the medications in an office setting. \nIn order for the organization to flag \nthe provider in its provider directory, the provider must: (1) possess a waiver currently approved by SAMHSA and the DEA; (2) have a valid and active \u2018\u2018X- number\u2019\u2019 from the DEA in order to administer, dispense, or prescribe MOUD; and (3) be listed on SAMHSA\u2019s BPL (have allowed their practice location to be disclosed publicly).\n15For \nmore information on how providers can become MOUD-waivered providers, see the SAMHSA website.\n16This proposal \nwould require organizations to identify such providers in their provider directories by including notations next to the providers\u2019 listings indicating that the providers are able to treat patients with MOUD. No reference to the actual waiver in the provider directory is necessary to provide the necessary notices to the enrollee; however, the \norganization would need to determine which providers in their network currently have the waiver, have the valid and active \u2018\u2018X-number,\u2019\u2019 and are listed in SAMHSA\u2019s BPL in order to know which providers to flag in the provider directory as able to treat patients with MOUD. The provider directory would need to include language to indicate the meaning of the MOUD-waivered providers notation, which is that these providers have completed the training so that they may administer, dispense, or prescribe MOUD in an office setting and have agreed to be publicly identified, but that such notations are not inclusive of all providers who may do so. \nWe believe that this new proposed \nMA provider directory data element is important and necessary for ensuring access to behavioral health services for MA enrollees. It supports both national and CMS efforts related to behavioral health priorities and strategies, as described in section III.B.1. of this proposed rule. This proposal will help MA enrollees struggling with OUD find providers who can treat them by prescribing MOUD, moving them further along the path towards long-term recovery. \nIf finalized, CMS intends to monitor \norganization compliance with the proposed new requirements described here through periodic online provider directory reviews, as CMS deems necessary, and other activities that are consistent with CMS\u2019s existing compliance monitoring regarding provider directory requirements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6a8430b-d9a7-4709-afc5-4c3e77cf9b1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6a8430b-d9a7-4709-afc5-4c3e77cf9b1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "56c2f6b6-bdfa-4f6c-96d9-00a437833d4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4cc9fa5a609fa6a23242dc93e657e4cbe9b9e0758985bf60876944fe21dbef4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3dd32c7d-bdd7-46fb-8a20-3fd65f3b4f46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f6aa011e62ae227ede27cbe014ab090a10daee4ee1c95712e308a1144719c0c8"}}, "hash": "5b6178f538c778ba9397a07359333ac96ac32a474d1ba43b5cc676ca1e4a8120", "text": "These proposals to amend \n\u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i) both codify as new requirements certain existing guidance on best practices and introduce a new provider directory data element.

Also, organizations would use SAMHSA\u2019s BPL to identify approved providers who have allowed their practice location to be disclosed. We expect this proposed \nprovision to impose an additional minimal amount of information collection requirements (that is, reporting, recordkeeping, or third-party disclosure requirements) on organizations in terms of the updating of their existing processes related to provider directories, such as a template, related software, and the added data points for providers. However, we \nbelieve this burden does not need to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on the currently approved control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267), which states: \u2018\u2018The additional burden of translating this network into a directory which is posted on the plan website as well as the update and maintenance of this directory is part of the usual and customary normal business activities and as such is exempt from PRA by 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2).\u2019\u2019 Consequently, there is no need for review by OMB under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

Digital Health Education for Medicare \nAdvantage (MA) Enrollees Using Telehealth (\u00a7 422.112) \nTelehealth has become increasingly \npopular and essential to providing access to health care, especially during the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency (PHE). For the purposes of this section of this proposed rule, we are using the term \u2018\u2018telehealth benefits\u2019\u2019 very broadly to encompass covered services that are furnished to the enrollee (that is, the patient) in a different location than where the provider is located; there are multiple categories of covered benefits where this circumstance is present, with additional criteria or requirements applying to different categories of covered benefits when the enrollee and provider are not in the same place at the time the service is furnished. Under the \nMA program, there are various requirements and options for coverage of telehealth benefits. When original Medicare covers telehealth benefits, such as services described in section 1834(m) of the Act and \u00a7 411.78, MA organizations must cover those telehealth benefits as basic benefits, as defined in \u00a7 422.100(c).

Washington, DC: \nContinued that must be covered by every MA plan, \nMA organizations have the option to offer \u2018\u2018Additional Telehealth Benefits\u2019\u2019 (ATBs) and/or supplemental telehealth benefits. Section 1852(m) of the Act and \u00a7 422.135 outline the requirements for ATBs, which are generally services for which benefits are available under Medicare Part B but which are not payable under section 1834(m) of the Act, and the services are furnished when the patient and the physician or practitioner are not in the same location. If an MA organization wishes to offer telehealth benefits that are not covered by original Medicare and are not within the scope of \u00a7 422.135, then the MA organization may choose to offer them as supplemental benefits. The requirements for MA supplemental benefits are set forth at section 1852(a)(3) of the Act and \u00a7\u00a7 422.100(c) and 422.102. An MA organization\u2019s bid must accurately reflect the covered telehealth service, whether it is covered as an ATB or a supplemental benefit. In addition, during the COVID\u201319 PHE, MA organizations have been required to take into account the various waivers, amendments to regulations, and other guidance published by CMS, with regard to telehealth benefits. In using the term \u2018\u2018telehealth benefits\u2019\u2019 here, we mean to include all of these various categories of covered benefits. In the regulation text we are proposing here, we use the phrase \u2018\u2018covered benefits that are furnished when the enrollee and the provider are not in the same location using electronic exchange, as defined in \u00a7 422.135\u2019\u2019 as a means to encompass all of the potential covered benefits included in our broad use of the term \u2018\u2018telehealth benefits.\u2019\u2019 As defined in \u00a7 422.135, electronic exchange means electronic information and telecommunications technology, which we believe is broad enough to include telecommunications and technologies permitted for covered Part B services under section 1834(m) of the Act and implementing regulations as well as MA ATBs and other supplemental benefits. \nIn recent years, CMS has seen a \nsignificant boost in the offering of telehealth benefits in the MA program. Almost 99 percent of MA plans offered some form of telehealth benefits in contract year 2022, either in the form of ATBs or supplemental telehealth benefits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72cf5b4a-0483-4958-9ce3-61ec607ffc63": {"__data__": {"id_": "72cf5b4a-0483-4958-9ce3-61ec607ffc63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "947c5d91-70bc-46e3-9ebf-b4f4d03e2a1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "63aee37cc7cb5b28a625cd63218f40c7879d808a5cf0732073b6b25ca4bbce4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "766c0c2c-f98f-4704-a82e-feebc6e833dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7fd4c7d24c979dcf9c1f4a4c0a0f7e0a5cfa8d77f72a08719f91fcd0875cbd25"}}, "hash": "cd869eb4d742a69b6b0b4d53bc18e8aa4131dcac7c929c7e71e726bd502db63c", "text": "This is a 16 percent increase since contract year 2018 and a 9 percent increase since contract year 2020, which was the first year MA organizations were permitted to offer ATBs. ATB offerings alone have increased by approximately 39 percent since their inception 2 years ago. The total number of MA enrollees who have access to MA \ntelehealth benefits of any kind has risen from approximately 89 percent in contract year 2018 to nearly 100 percent in contract year 2022. \nWhile the supply and demand of \ntelehealth has clearly grown in recent years, there is evidence that barriers to accessing telehealth leave room to improve health equity in telehealth. The regulatory change we are proposing here is an attempt to improve health equity in telehealth and is consistent with both E.O. 13985 and CMS\u2019s first strategic pillar \u2018\u2018Advance Equity\u2019\u2019 under the 2022 CMS Strategic Plan.\n17 18For purposes of \nthis provision, we are using CMS\u2019s definition of health equity, which is included in section III.A.1. of this proposed rule.\n19In developing this \nproposal, we are also guided by HHS\u2019s definition of \u2018\u2018health equity in telehealth\u2019\u2019 as meaning the \u2018\u2018opportunity for everyone to receive the health care they need and deserve, regardless of social or economic status. Providing health equity in telehealth means making changes in digital literacy, technology, and analytics, which will help telehealth providers reach the underserved communities that need it the most.\u2019\u2019\n20 \nHealth equity in telehealth is difficult \nto attain due to barriers to telehealth access, which may include: lack of video sharing technology (for example, a smartphone, tablet, or computer), spotty or no internet access, lack of housing or private space to participate in virtual visits, few local providers who offer telehealth practices, language barriers (including oral, written, and signed language), the inability to incorporate third party auxiliary aids and services such as live captioners, telehealth software, apps, and websites that are accessible and usable by people \nwith disabilities, and lack of adaptive equipment for people with disabilities along with incompatibility with external assistive technologies used by people with disabilities.\n21These barriers are especially burdensome on populations \nthat may already experience health disparities, such as those who are adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality, those who live in rural \nareas, people from some racial and ethnic groups, immigrants, people who identify as LGBTQI+, people with disabilities, older people, limited English proficient individuals, people with limited digital literacy, and people who are underinsured or uninsured. Such underserved communities often lack equitable access to health care, leading to consequences such as: higher mortality and disease rates, more severe disease and illness, higher medical costs, lack of access to treatment, and lack of access to health insurance.\n22 \nThe existence of communities with \nlow digital health literacy who in turn cannot access telehealth represents a significant obstacle in achieving health equity in telehealth. The World Health Organization defines digital health literacy as \u2018\u2018the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem. Examples of digital health literacy include accessing your electronic health record, communicating electronically with your health care team, ability to discern reliable online health information, and using health and wellness apps.\u2019\u2019\n23Low digital health \nliteracy can impact an individual\u2019s access to or quality of telehealth visits.\n24 \nEvidence shows that those with low digital health literacy tend to be older, lower income, less educated, and Black or Hispanic.\n25 \nMany older adults with low digital \nhealth literacy experience gaps in access to the health care they need, and this is concerning for the MA program, whose enrollee population includes individuals age 65 and older (as well as individuals under age 65 with disabilities). For example, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) annual technology survey found that more than half of older adults (age 50 and older) in 2021 indicated they need more digital education, while more than one in three said they lacked confidence when using technology.\n26Of the 32 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ad8bd1c-5b82-45fc-854f-440a7c7b9b53": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ad8bd1c-5b82-45fc-854f-440a7c7b9b53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80873e78-7789-49ea-994d-cd5b639f96c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a7b98c1f7ddac662b5493f4cf7742b4d56dcd72b30ff216d7815367591741248"}, "3": {"node_id": "030b9b2d-cbb0-4383-8a9f-2fd02037c39b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eedd6277541b0d329ad5f59299cb680c37a84bf732d407b19cb55b2dbf80c9c5"}}, "hash": "9c82ab8e09a17f348eae2c6185760c530dbf5f30c8f96170a293f9ffe7ad9d8a", "text": "79484 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAARP Research, April 2021. https://doi.org/ \n10.26419/res.00420.001. \n27https://www.telehealthequitycoalition.org/ \nimproving-digital-literacy-to-improve-telehealth- equity.html. \n28Shah M.K., Gibbs A.C., Ali M.K., Narayan \nK.M.V., Islam N.

Given the need to increase digital health literacy in many communities with MA enrollees and the goal to achieve health equity in telehealth, we believe it is necessary to implement regulations addressing digital health literacy in the MA program. CMS expects that these digital health literacy proposals, if finalized, would help underserved communities in need of assistance to improve their digital health literacy and help advance the goal of achieving health equity in telehealth.\n36 \nWe propose to add requirements for \nMA organizations to develop and maintain procedures to identify and offer digital health education to enrollees with low digital health literacy to assist them with accessing any medically necessary covered telehealth benefits. Specifically, we propose to amend current continuity of care requirements for MA organizations offering coordinated care plans to \u2018\u2018ensure continuity of care and integration of services through arrangements with contracted providers\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 422.112(b), by adding a new paragraph (9). The new proposed paragraph would require MA organizations to develop and maintain procedures to identify and offer digital health education to enrollees with low \ndigital health literacy to assist with accessing any medically necessary covered benefits that are furnished when the enrollee and the provider are not in the same location using electronic exchange; we use the term \u2018\u2018electronic exchange\u2019\u2019 as it is broadly defined in \u00a7 422.135. This proposed new continuity of care requirement would apply to all MA organizations offering \ncoordinated care plans (that is, HMOs, PPOs, HMO\u2013POSs, and SNPs) and would be relevant for all types of covered telehealth benefits, including basic telehealth benefits, ATBs, and supplemental telehealth benefits offered by MA coordinated care plans. We solicit comment on whether to amend \u00a7 422.100 instead of \u00a7 422.112(b) in order to apply this new requirement to all MA plans and not just coordinated care plans. This proposed additional standard is intended to ensure that MA enrollees are able to access covered benefits and that MA organizations meet their obligations under section 1852(d) of the Act to make covered benefits available and accessible to enrollees in the plan. Section 1856(b) of the Act authorizes the adoption of standards that are consistent with and to carry out the Part C statute. As telehealth benefits become more prevalent in the MA program, taking steps to provide enrollees with digital health education will ensure that these telehealth benefits are truly accessible and available to enrollees. \nThis proposal would be a first step for \nMA organizations to assess the landscape of health equity in telehealth in their plans and help enrollees navigate telehealth. Under this proposal, CMS would provide a degree of discretion for MA organizations in the procedures developed and used to identify enrollees with low digital health literacy and the digital health \neducation services the MA organization provides for those enrollees. In order to comply with the proposed new regulation, MA organizations would necessarily have to introduce a digital health literacy screening program or other similar procedure to identify current enrollees with low digital health literacy, however, MA organizations would have flexibility to design their own screening program or procedure. Some experts recommend such an assessment should examine patient- level barriers such as telehealth readiness, broadband access, and inaccessible or unusable information and communication technologies by individuals with disabilities that limit patient use of telehealth.\n37Others \nrecommend considering certain digital foundation skills based on a specific framework.\n38CMS encourages MA \norganizations to research current trends and successes in the field when developing their own methods to identify enrollees with low digital \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a821eb60-97b1-44a4-ac81-030113a23433": {"__data__": {"id_": "a821eb60-97b1-44a4-ac81-030113a23433", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8461322e-1350-4286-907d-de8572b51ce4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7d2c92606cfebe625389d075459da4041ad45da46e9eb2d0934d5e08175a8527"}, "3": {"node_id": "11d91acd-da42-4e98-b259-a3e2febe9a61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c25864995b090559537f6189ae7407cfc064aecb5e0b8a6f3e38e1afa683955d"}}, "hash": "ce8ef8194c8ad3603a1200584d7ce7a37fa0cffaf6971e6a622c187a742b9a30", "text": "79485 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n39https://www.telehealthequitycoalition.org/ \nimproving-digital-literacy-to-improve-telehealth- \nequity.html. 40https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ \nguidance-on-nondiscrimination-in-telehealth.pdf. health literacy. CMS anticipates that \nsome MA organizations could ask enrollees, for example, if they have internet access and reliable connectivity, if they have a device that meets appropriate telehealth system requirements, if they use email, if they can download a mobile app, or if they can change applicable settings on a device (for example, browser or camera settings), as a means to identify which enrollees have low digital heath literacy.\n39 \nOnce the MA organization determines \nwhich enrollees experience low digital health literacy, the MA organization would then have to implement a digital health education program to offer to these enrollees. CMS is not proposing to identify explicit parameters for this digital health education requirement, \nrather, we have chosen to keep it flexible and allow for innovation in this area by MA organizations. Depending on the specific enrollment in an MA plan, the procedures to identify enrollees and the mechanisms and content of the digital health education could vary. However, some examples of digital health education designs include: distributing educational materials about how to access certain telehealth technologies in multiple languages, including sign language, and in alternative formats; holding digital health literacy workshops; integrating digital health coaching; offering enrollees in-person digital health navigators; and partnering with local libraries and/or community centers that offer digital health education services and supports. \nAs a best practice, CMS encourages \nMA organizations to ensure that there are no system requirements (for example, online portal enrollment) that could act as barriers to accessing covered telehealth benefits, or the proposed digital health education for enrollees with low digital health literacy, so as to promote ease of access in the simplest way possible. In addition, if an MA organization offers enrollees assistance with any necessary telehealth technology\u2014for instance, if they provide limited use smartphones/ tablets or cellular data plans as supplemental benefits in order to aid in the use of telehealth services\u2014then the MA organization must comply with applicable laws about those benefits and make enrollees aware of these available benefits per section 1852(c)(1)(F) of the Act and \u00a7 422.111(b)(6). This disclosure is especially important for enrollees identified as having low digital health literacy. Smartphones and tablets (or other similar equipment) must only be used for primarily health related purposes (and cellular data plans can only be provided if use of these plans is locked and limited to health-related activities), such as when the device is locked except for remote monitoring or to enable engagement with health care providers, in order for these items and services to be permissible supplemental benefits under \u00a7 422.100(c)(2)(ii). However, furnishing or covering a cellular data plan without limitations might be permissible (under section 1852(a)(3)(D) of the Act and \u00a7 422.102(f)) as a non-primarily health related special supplemental benefit for the chronically ill (SSBCI) when the benefit is limited to a chronically ill enrollee and has a reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining the health or overall function of the chronically ill enrollee. For more information on SSBCI, please see the June 2020 final rule and the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly final rule which appeared in the Federal Register on January 19, 2021 (86 FR 5864) (hereinafter referred to as the January 2021 final rule). CMS encourages MA organizations whose plans have a high number of enrollees with low digital health literacy to consider offering the aforementioned supplemental benefits and pairing an appropriate digital health education program with the provision of such devices to enrollees, where permitted by applicable law. \nTo further emphasize the importance \nof health equity and health equity in telehealth specifically, CMS reminds MA organizations that \u00a7 422.112(a)(8) as it currently reads requires MA organizations offering coordinated care plans to ensure that services are provided in a culturally competent manner to all enrollees, including limited English proficient individuals or those with limited reading skills, and those with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

Furthermore, the HHS Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division recently published new guidance providing clarity on how Federal nondiscrimination laws require accessibility for people with disabilities and limited English proficient individuals in health care provided via telehealth.\n40These Federal civil rights \nlaws\u2014including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and section 1557 of the PPACA\u2014require that telehealth be accessible to people with disabilities and limited English proficient individuals. CMS strongly encourages MA organizations and their contracted providers to review this new guidance issued by HHS and DOJ to ensure compliance with Federal civil rights laws pertaining to telehealth. \nIn order to monitor the impact of our \nnew proposed requirement for digital health literacy screening and digital health education programs\u2014on MA organizations, providers, enrollees, and the MA program as a whole\u2014we are also proposing to require MA organizations to make information about these programs available to CMS upon request, per proposed \u00a7 422.112(b)(9)(i). We propose that this requested information may include, but is not limited to, statistics on the number of enrollees identified with low digital health literacy and receiving digital health education, manner(s) or method of digital health literacy screening and digital health education, financial impact of the programs on the MA \norganization, evaluations of effectiveness of digital health literacy interventions, and demonstration of compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 422.112(b)(9). The purpose of requiring MA organizations to make such information available to CMS upon request would be to identify best practices for improving digital health literacy amongst MA enrollees and to determine whether CMS should make improvements to the regulation and/or guidance regarding this requirement. We note that the regulation text at proposed \u00a7 422.112(b)(9)(i) includes the language \u2018\u2018upon request,\u2019\u2019 which we intend here to communicate that CMS \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "767ee7e4-a615-4de8-8c1f-cf052c0239b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "767ee7e4-a615-4de8-8c1f-cf052c0239b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "babb0a17-8343-4fd2-a7ea-c07cfdf41f39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "efc8148fd3535948c5fa7f30b1c1369adf7380863acfe1b02bd7b4f0385997ae"}, "3": {"node_id": "54b8e371-4dfe-4bab-8eab-986e58390f33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d6f36eb519c091d878c810652e5e9a158fa4a638b6cf3c31ce24d1f219954e7e"}}, "hash": "ff67574e85846cb96e2eeed73e7e20c20dd47dbd7cffaea7aec8c4ff2ee8c41e", "text": "79486 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n41https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ \nMedicare-Advantage-Quality-Improvement- \nProgram/5CCIP. does not intend to establish uniform \ndata collection from all MA organizations at this time, but instead reserves the right to ask for this information from individual MA organizations. However, we note that our proposed \u00a7 422.112(b)(9)(i) would not limit CMS\u2019s audit access when program audits review the performance of MA organizations. We solicit comment on this aspect of our proposal and whether we should require regular reporting of data of this type from all MA organizations alongside other Part C reporting requirements. \nThis proposal to amend \u00a7 422.112(b) \nwould impact MA organizations in terms of the burden required to both identify enrollees with low digital health literacy and to develop digital health education programs for these enrollees. However, our estimated analysis of these impacts is qualitative in nature as we are proposing to provide MA organizations flexibility in determining how they wish to implement these proposed CMS requirements. CMS does not currently collect data regarding digital health literacy among MA enrollees and therefore, we have no way of knowing or estimating the extent of low digital health literacy specifically among MA organizations\u2019 enrollees, how MA organizations would approach digital health literacy screening and digital health education, how much spending they would engage in related to these efforts, how much savings they would encounter (due to improved enrollee health outcomes because of improved digital health literacy), for example, how much time they would spend on these efforts, or how the MA program would grow as we see the effects of the proposed regulation. We estimate the direct qualitative burden consists of MA organization staff hours spent, resources purchased, and any digital health education for enrollees performed. MA organizations may also differ in how their spending for the proposed requirements evolves over time as they test strategies and redevelop their approaches to complying with the regulation. Thus, the proposed provision would impose an unknown amount of information collection requirements (that is, reporting, recordkeeping, or third-party disclosure requirements) because burden cannot be quantified. We solicit comment from MA organizations on how much burden they expect this proposed provision might add. Regarding the impact of the proposed requirement for the MA organization to make information about its digital health literacy screening and digital health education programs available to CMS upon request, we do not anticipate requesting this information from more than nine MA organizations in a given year. However, we believe it is important to reserve the right to ask for this information if necessary and have structured the proposed regulation text accordingly. Since we estimate fewer than ten respondents, the information collection requirement is exempt (5 CFR 1320.3(c)) from the requirements of the PRA of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Consequently, there is no need for review by OMB under the authority of the PRA. \nIn terms of economic impact on the \nMedicare Trust Fund, we do expect that improved digital health literacy would increase telehealth visits, which in turn would increase prevention of MA enrollee illness, both of which affect Medicare Trust Fund spending. Yet we have no way of knowing or estimating how much of an increase in telehealth visits there would be, for what specific services they would increase, or the effects of prevented future illnesses among MA enrollees. Thus, this provision is expected to have an unknown economic impact on the Medicare Trust Fund. \nIn summary, CMS is proposing to add \na new requirement at \u00a7 422.112(b)(9) that MA organizations must have procedures to identify enrollees with low digital health literacy and offer them digital health education to assist with accessing any medically necessary covered benefits that are furnished when the enrollee and the provider are not in the same location using electronic exchange, as defined in \u00a7 422.135. In addition, the proposal includes a requirement that MA organizations make information about these programs available to CMS upon request. We solicit comment on this proposal. \n5.

Section 422.152(c) provides that \nCCIPs must include methods for \nidentifying MA enrollees with multiple or sufficiently severe chronic conditions that would benefit from participating in a CCIP; mechanisms for monitoring MA enrollees that are participating in the CCIP and evaluating participant outcomes, such as changes in health status; performance assessments that use quality indicators that are objective, clearly and unambiguously defined, and based on current clinical knowledge or research, and systematic and ongoing follow-up on the effect of the CCIP. Organizations must report the status and results of each program to CMS as requested. The intent of the CCIPs is to promote effective chronic disease management and improve care and \nhealth outcomes for enrollees with chronic conditions. Furthermore, CCIPs should support the CMS Quality Strategy; include interventions that surpass MA organizations\u2019 inherent care coordination role and overall management of enrollees; engage enrollees as partners in their care; promote utilization of preventive services; facilitate development of targeted goals, specific interventions, and quantifiable, measurable outcomes; guard against potential health disparities; and produce best practices.\n41 \nIn accordance with 1852(e) of the Act, \nMA organizations are required to report quality performance data to CMS. MA organizations generally report such data through the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), Health Outcomes Survey (HOS), Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS), and other related data collection tools. As codified at \u00a7 422.152(b)(3) and (5), MA coordinated care plans are required to report on quality performance data which CMS can use to help beneficiaries compare plans; MA local and regional PPO plans must similarly report under \u00a7 422.152(e)(2)(i). The areas of measurement include outcomes, patient experience, access, and process measures. In addition, CMS uses this information to develop and publicly post a 5-star rating system for MA plans based on its authority to disseminate comparative information, including about quality, to beneficiaries under sections 1851(d) and 1860D\u20131(c) of the Act. \nLastly, to meet the needs of their \nenrolled special needs populations, MA special needs plans (SNPs) have \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86cd9250-3aca-4ee3-8b77-a5b21b998040": {"__data__": {"id_": "86cd9250-3aca-4ee3-8b77-a5b21b998040", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06b6d97c-a1e7-4a91-bb42-79dd9f2206ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3a35dfb566dc1ca6ae5e8e804a98cf6d898ad8eb8b80dffcf7102c1e4df06e93"}, "3": {"node_id": "071dc07e-47a2-4476-b6b1-831ef67c0f8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6d3df319c7139875959b7570b89a2bd2737cc1a6212af38191f2223c62dc83a4"}}, "hash": "482f4a32151dcb8d91ae945c75dfd2c7a0049a664a6014f21248b5c3eed127c5", "text": "79487 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n42Disparities in Health Care in Medicare \nAdvantage by Race, Ethnicity and Sex, April 2022. \n43Lindenauer, P.K., Lagu, T., Rothberg, M.B., \nAvrunin, J., Pekow, P.S., Wang, Y., Krumholz, H., \n& Hines, H.

We expect that this data collection would also provide information to MA organizations about potential health disparities among their enrollees. \nPersistent inequities in health care \noutcomes exist in the United States, including among populations enrolled in MA organizations.\n42Belonging to a \nracial or ethnic minority group, living \nwith a disability, being a member of the LGBTQI+ community, having limited English proficiency, living in a rural area, or being near or below the poverty level, is often associated with worse health outcomes.\n43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Such \ndisparities in health outcomes are the result of a number of factors and exist regardless of health insurance coverage type. Although not the sole determinant, poor health care access and provision of lower quality health care contribute to health disparities. Research has shown that the expansion of health insurance coverage, for example through Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and the resulting increased access to health care, is linked to reductions in disparities in health insurance coverage as well as reductions in disparities in health outcomes.\n50 \nIn the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2023\u2019\u2019, which appeared in the Federal Register May 6, 2022 (87 FR 27208), CMS finalized a proposal to update the quality improvement strategy (QIS) standards for qualified health plan \n(QHP) issuers, requiring them to address health and health care disparities as a specific topic area within their QIS beginning in 2023. Examples of QIS activities that fall under the health and health care disparities topic area for QHPs can include language services, community outreach, cultural competency trainings, social needs- sensitive self-management recommendations, and increased demographic and disparities-related data collection; see the QIS Technical Guidance and User Guide for the 2023 Plan Year for more information. CMS is committed to advancing health equity for MA enrollees. Based on CMS\u2019 definition of health equity and in alignment with similar CMS programs, we believe that MA organizations\u2019 QI programs are an optimal vehicle to develop and implement strategies and policies designed to reduce disparities in health and health care, and advance equity in the health and health care of MA enrollee populations, especially those that are underserved. \nMA organizations have long focused \non addressing health disparities through QI program requirements. By assessing cultural, language, health literacy, financial, psychosocial & family support, community networks, and transportation needs, etc., and addressing those needs through a variety of QI program activities across their enrollee populations, MA organizations gain insight into their enrollee populations. Some of the specific QI activities include addressing barriers to health care, for example assisting enrollees with transportation to follow-up primary care visits post- hospitalization, linking enrollees to community resources, and improving care coordination and case management, especially for vulnerable and/or underserved enrollees. In addition to implementing QI activities for the broader enrollee populations, we are aware that some MA organizations have focused their QI activities on underserved groups. For example, to better serve these groups, several MA organizations have made efforts to improve their communication by providing cultural trainings for their staff, tailoring enrollee materials to ensure they are linguistically and culturally appropriate, and hiring plan staff and establishing contracts with providers who are bilingual. Some MA organizations have implemented specific interventions that target blood pressure control, or improved rates for various cancer screenings in targeted groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a591c5b8-0c7c-40cc-8aa2-abd4f4331fd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a591c5b8-0c7c-40cc-8aa2-abd4f4331fd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06b6d97c-a1e7-4a91-bb42-79dd9f2206ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3a35dfb566dc1ca6ae5e8e804a98cf6d898ad8eb8b80dffcf7102c1e4df06e93"}, "2": {"node_id": "071dc07e-47a2-4476-b6b1-831ef67c0f8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6d3df319c7139875959b7570b89a2bd2737cc1a6212af38191f2223c62dc83a4"}}, "hash": "6791ca1edb3f555cb0ed19fe2ca2942933d39a689da2dd503ed5680251138e5c", "text": "These types of activities can \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a81a6548-f469-4af6-8893-c27951ca8f19": {"__data__": {"id_": "a81a6548-f469-4af6-8893-c27951ca8f19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce06aa6d-c3a1-4cc1-91d5-3e1b3afa8c16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "89c8f34ae69522dd04c5fce9c25fa3fc70defa1f830e7ed980bd14cc70e5c5bb"}, "3": {"node_id": "d067ab26-e4b9-42e2-bfe5-c26274384b83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e2060564a744f1d3d34d4c013f81abee0aeafea71c1bc78c6f830f8a79001592"}}, "hash": "e05f76b8e0e7cd5e9c00badcf4fe7e81fdbede59c4c7949365420f9748a345cb", "text": "79488 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n51https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/ \nstatements-releases/2022/05/31/fact-sheet-biden- \nharris-administration-highlights-strategy-to- address-the-national-mental-health-crisis/. \n52https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2022- \ncms-strategic-framework.pdf. \n53https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/ \nshortage-areas. \n54https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/ \nfiles/reports/rpt35325/ NSDUHFFRPDFWHTMLFiles2020/ 2020NSDUHFFR1PDFW102121.pdf. \n55https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/ \nfiles/reports/rpt35324/ \n2021NSDUHMHChartbook102221B.pdf. \n56https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/07/ \ndatapoint-care. improve the health of and healthcare for \nMA enrollees. \nTo improve the quality of care and \nhealth outcomes for MA enrollees and \nsupport the first pillar in the 2022 CMS strategic plan for advancing health equity, CMS proposes to amend the MA QI program regulations at \u00a7 422.152(a). Specifically, we propose to amend \u00a7 422.152 by adding a new paragraph (a)(5), to require MA organizations to incorporate one or more activities into their overall QI program that reduce disparities in health and health care among their enrollees. As previously described, we believe that many MA organizations are already addressing disparities and gaps in care for underserved populations through a variety of quality initiatives. Rather than limit these activities to specific QI program requirements such as the CCIPs, we are proposing that MA organizations would be required to incorporate one or more activities that reduce disparities in health and health care across the broad spectrum of QI program requirements. CMS expects that MA organizations may implement activities such as improving communication, developing and using linguistically and culturally appropriate materials (to distribute to enrollees or use in communicating with enrollees), hiring bilingual staff, community outreach, or similar activities. MA organizations should tailor these activities to meet the needs of their enrollees, and therefore CMS is generally not proposing to be prescriptive in the types of activities MA organizations must implement to meet this proposed new requirement. However, MA organizations must ensure that these activities are broadly accessible irrespective of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, or gender. These activities may be based upon health status and health needs, geography, or factors not listed in the previous sentence only as appropriate to address the relevant disparity in health or health care. Furthermore, we believe adopting this proposed requirement for MA organizations as part of their required QI programs will align with health equity efforts across CMS policies and programs. CMS believes that several organizations have already incorporated these activities into their QI programs, thereby meeting the proposed requirement. B. Behavioral Health in Medicare \nAdvantage (MA) (\u00a7\u00a7 422.112, 422.113, and 422.116) \n1. Introduction \nOn March 1, 2022, President Biden \nannounced a national strategy regarding \nbehavioral health to strengthen system capacity and connect more individuals to care by ensuring that the nation\u2019s health and social services infrastructure addresses mental health holistically and equitably.\n51Further, the 2022 CMS \nStrategic Framework describes CMS\u2019 broad goals to expand coverage and enhance access to equitable health care services for those covered under CMS programs.\n52CMS is also prioritizing, as \npart of the agency\u2019s many cross-cutting initiatives, to improve access to behavioral health services and outcomes for people with behavioral health care needs. \nAccording to the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA), more than one-third of Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas,\n53meaning \nthese communities do not have enough providers to meet the needs of their population. Furthermore, according to the results from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, published by SAMHSA, while overall 65 percent of people with serious mental illnesses (SMI) receive treatment,\n54people of color with SMI \nreceive care at significantly lower rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d067ab26-e4b9-42e2-bfe5-c26274384b83": {"__data__": {"id_": "d067ab26-e4b9-42e2-bfe5-c26274384b83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce06aa6d-c3a1-4cc1-91d5-3e1b3afa8c16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "89c8f34ae69522dd04c5fce9c25fa3fc70defa1f830e7ed980bd14cc70e5c5bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "a81a6548-f469-4af6-8893-c27951ca8f19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e05f76b8e0e7cd5e9c00badcf4fe7e81fdbede59c4c7949365420f9748a345cb"}}, "hash": "e2060564a744f1d3d34d4c013f81abee0aeafea71c1bc78c6f830f8a79001592", "text": "More specifically, while approximately 69 percent of white people with SMI received mental health care, for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people with SMI the rates were 55 percent, 56 percent, and 44 percent respectively.\n55The 2020 \nNational Survey results also indicate that common reasons for not receiving treatment for SMI include: inability to afford the cost of treatment, not knowing where to go to receive services, and health insurance not covering services.\n56CMS recently included a \nrequest for information (RFI) in the proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 published in the Federal Register January 12, 2022 \n(87 FR 1842) (hereinafter referred to as the January 2022 proposed rule), to solicit public comment regarding the challenges that exist with accessing behavioral health providers within MA plans. We sought stakeholders\u2019 input concerning a range of topics, including the challenges related to building behavioral health networks for MA plans, accessing behavioral health providers for MA enrollees, and requesting suggestions on how to address issues with building adequate behavioral health networks within MA plans. We received a number of comments from stakeholders, some of which are discussed later in this preamble in connection with specific proposals. \nCMS continues to evaluate and seek \nways to enhance our behavioral health policies to address the healthcare needs of those we serve. In order to support these goals, we are proposing regulatory changes that focus on ensuring access to behavioral health services for MA enrollees. \nWe welcome comment on our \nproposals. \n2. Behavioral Health Specialties in \nMedicare Advantage (MA) Networks (\u00a7\u00a7 422.112 and 422.116) \nSection 1852(d)(1) of the Act permits \nan MA organization to select the providers from which an enrollee may receive covered benefits, provided that the MA organization, in addition to meeting other requirements, makes such benefits available and accessible in the service area with promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits. To implement and adopt related standards for this, CMS codified, with some modifications, network adequacy criteria and access \nstandards that were previously outlined in sub-regulatory guidance in the \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2021 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, and Medicare Cost Plan Program\u2019\u2019 final rule, which appeared in the Federal Register on June 2, 2020 (85 FR 33796), hereinafter referred to as the June 2020 final rule. In that final rule, we codified, at \u00a7 422.116(b), the list of 27 provider specialty types and 13 facility specialty types subject to CMS network adequacy standards. Although \u00a7 422.116(b)(3) authorizes removal of a specialty or facility type from the network evaluation criteria for a specific year without rulemaking, CMS did not adopt \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ca0b4ca-65f3-42e3-a671-a6cb9e47c089": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ca0b4ca-65f3-42e3-a671-a6cb9e47c089", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "581bd693-f8ef-43ab-9c1d-3e27b55bd61c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eb3d3a89d33fdc19f471a5efbeb970e9b6f886e8c09d15b3dc28a5bf5189e698"}, "3": {"node_id": "74e95df9-aeb7-49b4-96d8-e19dc9dba94d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f152136656f97c172e877dce9cb9824ea734b8b59531254757341f43aef4ce89"}}, "hash": "1fb9c206cae76c75c23a786911a449878a5dbfb62c8f46f2b9076e1eef9fdabb", "text": "79489 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n57https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-02-22- \n00390.pdf. in \u00a7 422.116 a mechanism to add new \nprovider types without rulemaking. We are proposing to add to the list of provider specialties here to address access to behavioral health services more broadly than the current regulation. \nCurrently, MA organizations are \nrequired to demonstrate that they meet network adequacy for two behavioral health specialty types, psychiatry and inpatient psychiatric facility services, under \u00a7 422.116(b). Further, the regulation at \u00a7 422.112 includes a number of requirements to ensure that MA enrollees have adequate access to covered services. Of note, \u00a7 422.112(a)(1) requires MA organizations to maintain and monitor a network of appropriate providers that provides access to typically used services including, primary care providers, specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, ambulatory clinics and other providers. \nIn response to the RFI in the January \n2022 proposed rule, we received comments emphasizing the importance of network adequacy and ensuring adequate access to behavioral health providers in MA plans. Stakeholders suggested that CMS expand the network adequacy time and distance standards for MA plans beyond those that we \ncurrently review through our network adequacy evaluations. Commenters suggested that we expand the standards to add other outpatient behavioral health physicians and health professionals, including those that treat substance use disorders (SUDs), that can meet MA enrollees needs in accessing behavioral healthcare. Even though over one million \nMedicare beneficiaries had a diagnosis \nof Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and more than fifty thousand experienced an overdose in 2021, fewer than 1 in 5 of these Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of OUD receive treatment for their OUD.\n57Current standards of care \nfor OUD include treatment through three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications (buprenorphine, naltrexone and methadone), along with other services to provide the best approach to treating SUD. Enrollees can access Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) in various settings including in Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) and through qualified practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, etc.) who have obtained a waiver through SAMHSA to dispense these medications in office settings. \nCMS is committed to ensuring that \nMA enrollees have access to provider networks sufficient to provide covered services, including access to behavioral health service providers. Medicare fee- for-service claims data for 2020 shows that for certain outpatient behavioral health services, the top provider specialty types to provide services to beneficiaries included psychiatrists, \nclinical social workers, nurse practitioners, and clinical psychologists. OTPs had the largest number of claims for SUD in this same time period. Therefore, we propose to strengthen our network adequacy requirements for MA plans as it relates to behavioral health in three ways. \nFirst, we propose to add three new \nprovider specialty types to the list at \u00a7 422.116(b)(1), requiring these new \nspecialty types to be subject to network adequacy evaluation. The three new specialty types we propose to add are: (1) clinical psychology, (2) clinical social work, and (3) one category called Prescribers of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder that includes two specialty types: providers with a waiver under section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and OTPs. Most of these new specialty types are defined the same way as they are used for the original Medicare program in section 1861(hh) of the Act (defining \u2018\u2018clinical social worker\u2019\u2019), \u00a7 410.71(d) (defining \u2018\u2018clinical psychologist\u2019\u2019), and section 1861(jjj)(2) of the Act (defining \u2018\u2018Opioid Treatment Program\u2019\u2019). Section 303(g)(2)of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 823(g)(2)(G)(ii)) establishes which providers have a waiver and we do not believe a definition in the MA regulations at 42 CFR part 422 is necessary. \nOur current regulations, at \n\u00a7 422.116(a)(2) specify that an MA plan must meet maximum time and distance standards and contract with a specified minimum number of each provider and facility-specialty type.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74e95df9-aeb7-49b4-96d8-e19dc9dba94d": {"__data__": {"id_": "74e95df9-aeb7-49b4-96d8-e19dc9dba94d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "581bd693-f8ef-43ab-9c1d-3e27b55bd61c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eb3d3a89d33fdc19f471a5efbeb970e9b6f886e8c09d15b3dc28a5bf5189e698"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ca0b4ca-65f3-42e3-a671-a6cb9e47c089", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1fb9c206cae76c75c23a786911a449878a5dbfb62c8f46f2b9076e1eef9fdabb"}}, "hash": "f152136656f97c172e877dce9cb9824ea734b8b59531254757341f43aef4ce89", "text": "Therefore, as part of the proposed changes to our list of provider specialty types under \u00a7 422.116(b)(1), we are proposing base time and distance standards and minimum number of in-person providers in each county type for each new specialty type as follows: \nMaximum Time and Distance \nStandards: \nMinimum Ratios: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.008</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2Large Metro Metro Micro Rural CEAC \nProvider/ Max Max Max Max Max Max Max Max Max Max \nFacility type Time Distance Time Distance Time Distance Time Distance Time Distance \nClinical Psvchologv 20 10 45 30 60 45 75 60 145 130 \nClinical Social Work 20 10 30 20 50 35 75 60 125 110 \nPrescribers of \nMedication for Opioid \nUse Disorder 20 10 30 20 50 35 75 60 110 100 (including MOUD \nWaivered Providers \nand/or OTPs)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a87372f5-f8ec-445b-b7d5-bc27a32c8381": {"__data__": {"id_": "a87372f5-f8ec-445b-b7d5-bc27a32c8381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98989098-d762-4a05-be8e-174ff0375251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b9a5a21f824fddcd0569dae9f2ca58c3989f8aa9c7ac25314d69ccc282ad8835"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce6d142e-1929-41b4-9445-4e1dddb02b56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b66fa3e6333b4a1607781fa307cd767a6510fc1af4aedfbfc8c4984a54264232"}}, "hash": "cbc7d11158c24e7e63c7a29021248ae74169688d7730e8d15982cfd9e2ebbe61", "text": "79490 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n58https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/projecting- \nhealth-workforce-supply-demand/behavioral- \nhealth. \n59https://pecos.cms.hhs.gov/pecos/ \nlogin.do#headingLv1. \n60https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- \ntreatment/find-treatment/treatment-practitioner- locator. 61https://data.cms.gov/provider-characteristics/ \nmedicare-provider-supplier-enrollment/opioid- \ntreatment-program-providers. \nIn the proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs; Contract Year \n2021 and 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly\u2019\u2019 proposed rule which appeared in the Federal Register on February 18, 2020 (85 FR 9002) (hereinafter referred to as the February 2020 proposed rule), we explained how CMS developed the base time and distance standards and the minimum provider requirements used in \u00a7 422.116 (85 FR 9094 through 9103). CMS established the current base time and distance standards for the provider and facility types listed in \u00a7 422.116 by mapping the various specialty types\u2019 practice locations from the National Provider and Plan Enumeration System (NPPES) National Provider Identifier (NPI) file compared with Medicare beneficiary locations from CMS enrollment data. We further explained that we then tested different options for combinations of beneficiary coverage percentages and maximum travel distances to determine what was feasible and practical for the majority of counties given the trade-off between beneficiary coverage and travel distance. The travel time standards were calculated according to the average driving speeds in each of the ZIP code types (urban, suburban, rural) that beneficiaries would traverse between their homes and the provider locations (85 FR 9097). Other than the use of the different and more recent data sources that are identified in this preamble, we followed the same analysis and steps to develop the time and distance standards that we propose to apply to the new behavioral health specialty types. \nFurther, we explained in the February \n2020 proposed rule that CMS determines the minimum number requirement for all provider specialty types by multiplying the \u2018\u2018minimum ratio\u2019\u2019 by the \u2018\u2018number of beneficiaries required to cover,\u2019\u2019 dividing the resulting product by 1,000, and rounding up to the next whole number. This is reflected in \u00a7 422.116(e)(2)(i) and (e)(3); the current regulation text addresses how the number of \nbeneficiaries required to cover is calculated and will apply to the proposed new provider specialty types. The minimum ratio is the number of providers required per 1,000 beneficiaries. We developed the minimum ratios that currently appear in \u00a7 422.116 using various data sources, including, Medicare fee for-service claims data, American Medical Association (AMA) and American Osteopathic Association (AOA) physician workforce data, US Census population data, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, and AMA data on physician productivity. In developing the proposal here to add new specialty types subject to network adequacy evaluation, we conducted additional research to inform appropriate minimum ratio requirements. We reviewed utilization data among FFS Medicare beneficiaries for the proposed specialty types for 2019 through 2021. We reviewed literature on the prevalence of behavioral health disorders among Medicare beneficiaries and existing models for projecting the needed behavioral health workforce such as the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s (HRSA) Health Workforce Simulation Model,\n58to \ninform estimates of the potential demand for behavioral health services.

As noted previously, the top provider specialty types to provide certain outpatient behavioral services to beneficiaries in that year included psychiatrists, clinical social workers, nurse practitioners, and clinical psychologists. Additionally, previous input from stakeholders discussed the importance of access to telehealth services specific to behavioral health in expanding access to care. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.009</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2Minimum Ratio Lame Metro Metro Micro Rural CEAC \nClinical Psychology 0.15 0.15 0.13 0.13 0.13 \nClinical Social Work 0.25 0.25 0.22 0.22 0.22 \nPrescribers of 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 \nMedication for Opioid \nUse Disorder (including \nMOUDWaivered \nProviders and/or 01Ps)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d3e17d1-2715-4c20-9475-c9d5a0d91631": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d3e17d1-2715-4c20-9475-c9d5a0d91631", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f051eb9e-1e05-4aff-b37b-aac1408dd701", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1ae5aab03ff8880593624a5d9218930235e64abb85f929e2a71e78ecb7c4312b"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6b47565-fdac-4d32-a0e2-f5eb9b2751b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d76de367f2a8445f43ff6517cfb140037d9e81e46c53422676d283f51a9e9d01"}}, "hash": "5ac2729b4b5d932d81dc9285ad7a9bef60dcd5c402fb1051385322f7733a01b5", "text": "79491 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nBased on these considerations, we also \npropose to add all the new behavioral health specialty types to the list at \u00a7 422.116(d)(5) of the specialty types that that will receive the credit if the MA organization\u2019s contracted network of providers includes one or more telehealth providers of that specialty type that provide additional telehealth benefits, as defined in \u00a7 422.135, for covered services. \nWe welcome comment on this \nproposal. \n3. Behavioral Health Services in \nMedicare Advantage (MA) (\u00a7\u00a7 422.112 and 422.113) \nIn addition to ensuring that there are \nspecific types of providers in behavioral health specialties accessible within certain parameters in an MA organization\u2019s network of providers, it is important to ensure that access to these services is available for enrollees as part of overall delivery and coordination of services. CMS recognizes that knowing where to go to receive behavioral health care services is key to ensuring accessibility to those services. While CMS requires MA organizations to maintain publicly available resources, such as the provider directory, in order to help enrollees access care, we acknowledge that such resources may not always be sufficient to connect enrollees with the services to which they are entitled. \nCMS also acknowledges that \nsituations may arise when a behavioral health services provider and an enrollee are not a good fit, and the enrollee needs assistance finding a different provider. \nFurther, when a provider leaves the network, enrollees could experience an interruption in services. Timely provision of care is important with respect to behavioral health outcomes, and with the following proposals, we seek to ensure that enrollees who need behavioral health services are able to access them in a timely manner. \nSection 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act \nrequires MA organizations to make benefits under the plan available and accessible to each individual electing the plan within the plan service area with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits. To ensure MA enrollees have access to their services that is consistent with the requirements of the statute, CMS proposes to use our authority under section 1856(b)(1) of the Act to adopt standards to implement section 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act to ensure that access to behavioral health services is prioritized appropriately in the Part C program. CMS proposes to advance this goal by adding behavioral health services to the types of services \nfor which MA organizations must have programs in place to ensure continuity of care and integration of services at \u00a7 422.112(b)(3). First, we propose to revise \u00a7 422.112(b)(3) to include behavioral health services by adding the phrase, \u2018\u2018and behavioral health services\u2019\u2019 after the words \u2018\u2018community-based services\u2019\u2019 at the end of \u00a7 422.112(b)(3). CMS believes that this proposed change to include behavioral health care services among the services for which MA organizations must have a care coordination program in place will help close the equity gap for enrollees in coordinated care plans. This proposed change would ensure that behavioral health care services are included as part of the enrollee\u2019s care coordination. \nNext, CMS proposes to codify the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of section 1852(d)(3)(B) of the Act which is used to determine a condition that qualifies as an \u2018\u2018emergency medical condition\u2019\u2019 for purposes of carrying out the requirements of section 1852(d)(1)(E) of the Act. Section 1852(d)(1)(E) of the Act requires MA organizations to reimburse a provider for emergency services without regard to prior authorization or the emergency care provider\u2019s contractual relationship with the MA organization. \nCurrently, under \u00a7 422.113(b)(1)(i), an \n\u2018\u2018emergency medical condition\u2019\u2019 is defined as a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in serious jeopardy to the health of the individual or their unborn child, serious impairment to bodily function, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; this regulatory definition generally mirrors the statutory definition in section 1852(d)(3)(B) of the Act. However, the definition does not explicitly address that its criteria extends to conditions both physical and mental.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b47565-fdac-4d32-a0e2-f5eb9b2751b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b47565-fdac-4d32-a0e2-f5eb9b2751b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f051eb9e-1e05-4aff-b37b-aac1408dd701", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1ae5aab03ff8880593624a5d9218930235e64abb85f929e2a71e78ecb7c4312b"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d3e17d1-2715-4c20-9475-c9d5a0d91631", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5ac2729b4b5d932d81dc9285ad7a9bef60dcd5c402fb1051385322f7733a01b5"}}, "hash": "d76de367f2a8445f43ff6517cfb140037d9e81e46c53422676d283f51a9e9d01", "text": "However, the definition does not explicitly address that its criteria extends to conditions both physical and mental. CMS interprets the scope of the definition to pertain to both physical and behavioral health conditions when those conditions meet the prudent layperson standard discussed in \u00a7 422.113(b)(1)(i), \nconsistent with the statute. \nFor example, one could reasonably be \nexpected to cause serious injury (or death) to oneself if one\u2019s behavioral health condition results in a suicide plan, attempt, other suicidal behavior, or other forms of serious self-harm; CMS believes such cases are sufficient to satisfy the prudent layperson standard, therefore immediate emergency medical intervention must be provided without \nregard to prior authorization or the emergency care provider\u2019s contractual relationship with the organization, consistent with the requirements of section 1852(d)(1)(E) of the Act. \nIt is important to ensure that MA \norganizations and affected stakeholders interpret the definition of \u2018\u2018emergency medical condition\u2019\u2019 found in \u00a7 422.113(b)(1)(i) in the same manner as CMS. Therefore, in an effort to mitigate the possibility that an applicable emergency medical condition, such a qualifying mental health condition, could be inadvertently excluded from the requirements and enrollee protections in \u00a7 422.113 due to misinterpretation by an MA organization or entities acting on its behalf, CMS proposes to add language to our regulations that will definitively clarify that an emergency medical condition can be physical or mental in nature. This interpretation and position on what \u00a7 422.113 means and requires will guide our enforcement of the regulation. MA organizations, providers and enrollees must comply with this interpretation of the regulation and doing so will assure that MA enrollees receive medically necessary services in a medical emergency. \nAt \u00a7 422.113(b)(1)(i), CMS proposes to \namend the regulation by inserting, \u2018\u2018mental or physical,\u2019\u2019 after the word \u2018\u2018condition\u2019\u2019 and before the word \u2018\u2018manifesting.\u2019\u2019 This proposed revision would ensure that emergency medical \nconditions are easily interpreted as such, thereby prohibiting the use of prior authorization when required and guaranteeing that coverage is provided by the MA organization, consistent with the statute. This will ensure that enrollees have access to emergency behavioral health services in parity with access to other medical emergency services. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal, \nand thank commenters in advance for their input on our proposed regulatory revisions. \n4.

We also heard that beneficiaries experience barriers to treatment for behavioral health conditions, including opioid use disorder. \nSection 1852(d) of the Act requires \nMA plans that use provider networks, make covered benefits available and accessible to enrollees in the plan service area with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits, and that medically necessary care must be available and accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The MA regulation at \u00a7 422.112 includes requirements and standards to ensure that MA organizations that offer coordinated care plans, which generally use networks of providers, meet the statutory requirements. Under these rules, MA organizations must ensure that all covered services are made available and accessible to enrollees by the plan\u2019s designated provider network. Furthermore, MA organizations are required under \u00a7 422.112(a)(6)(i) to maintain written standards that require timely access to care for enrollees which meet or exceed those established by CMS. Timely access to care and member services within a plan\u2019s provider network must be continuously monitored to ensure compliance with these standards, and the MA organization must take corrective action as necessary. CMS has provided guidelines for MA organizations in the Medicare Managed Care Manual (MMCM), Chapter 4, \u2018\u2018Benefits and Beneficiary Protections,\u2019\u2019 section 110.1.1,\n62regarding provider network \nstandards. That guidance includes directions that MA organizations make their timeliness standards known to network providers (which is necessary in order to ensure that providers in the network comply with MA plan\u2019s written standards) and that the MA organization should consider an enrollee\u2019s need for the services and common waiting times in the community. In particular, the Manual provides examples of appointment wait times for certain primary care services, based on the type of services and level of need: (1) urgently needed services or \nemergency\u2014immediately; (2) services that are not emergency or urgently needed, but requires medical attention\u2014within 1 week; and (3) routine and preventive care\u2014within 30 \ndays. \nThe 2022 CMS Behavioral Health \nStrategy\n63describes CMS\u2019 goals to \nincrease and enhance access to equitable behavioral health care services for people with behavioral health care needs. To support these goals, CMS is committed to strengthening our requirements for MA organizations to ensure beneficiaries can access needed behavioral health care services similar to how they access needed physical health services. Therefore, we propose to codify appointment wait times as standards for primary care services that are the same as the appointment wait times described in the Manual and to extend those standards to behavioral health services. These new minimum appointment wait time standards would be added to the existing requirement that MA organizations establish written policies for the timeliness of access to care and member services so that MA organizations must have appointment wait times that meet or exceed the standards we propose here. \nBehavioral health services include \nboth mental health services and substance use disorder services. We remind MA organizations that substance use disorder services include medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), which is particularly important as opioid-related overdose deaths have spiked during the pandemic,\n64and we have heard from \ncommenters that beneficiaries have experienced barriers to behavioral health treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67f34549-c942-4369-bacf-01f83e143a51": {"__data__": {"id_": "67f34549-c942-4369-bacf-01f83e143a51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83ce6b1f-1baa-4a8c-9c77-10219c269a1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "848f6a0de05d02d62d52e1f7f66a54730f76538c599c4197ffb99c1fe3b09ec0"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f265543-2650-4567-9f1c-7b89490c06eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2629f46419b84d9c6b59ca2e4ba52e8adc6b6fc50f97a4721ebce41a0bfc0d6c"}}, "hash": "5d24e47d05c9731134ea341c43362d2a9dae899fb5d109ca66295a54c1a9b333", "text": "Proposing to codify these wait time standards as discussed by commenters through our RFI, should reduce access barriers to behavioral health treatment for those who need it; and help ensure access to a robust array of practitioners furnishing behavioral health services, including Opioid Treatment Providers who prescribe medications for opioid use disorder. \nIn addition, the proposal to codify \nwait time standards for primary care is consistent with the goal to increase access to primary care articulated in HHS\u2019 Initiative to Strengthen Primary \nCare.\n65The National Academies for \nScience, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Report outlined the importance of ensuring that high-quality primary care is available to every individual and family in every community, particularly those that are underserved. After all, access to primary care practitioners, as opposed to any other practitioner type, is associated with decreased mortality.\n66 \nWe are also seeking comment on \nalternative specific appointment wait times standards to apply to MA organizations. For example, we are considering, as suggested by a commenter on our RFI, establishing appointment wait time standards that align with those established for qualified health plans, (QHPs) as outlined by CMS in the \u2018\u20182023 Final Letter to Issuers in the Federally- facilitated Exchanges.\u2019\u2019\n67The \nappointment wait time standards for QHPs include: Behavioral health appointments must be available within 10 business days, Primary care (routine) must be available within 15 business days; and Specialty care (non-urgent) must be available within 30 business days. Under our proposal, the wait time requirements,, would be applicable to primary care and behavioral health specialty types. We solicit comment whether a more flexible approach would be appropriate, such as requiring MA organizations have these specific appointment wait time standards in their written internal policies but that CMS require MA plans to meet the specific appointment wait time limits for routine or non-emergency services only for a significant portion (for example, 95 percent) of appointments. \nThis proposed additional requirement \nto specify maximum wait times for MA enrollees is intended to ensure that MA enrollees are able to access covered services and that MA organizations meet their obligations under section 1852(d) of the Act to make covered benefits available and accessible to enrollees in the plan.

Adequate access to services for MA enrollees is a key consideration. \nWe solicit comment on our proposal, \nincluding whether one or more of the previously described sets of wait time standards would more effectively address our goals of ensuring that MA organizations are meeting timely access standards for primary care and behavioral health services for enrollees, supporting parity between behavioral health and physical health services, and strengthening our requirements for MA organizations to ensure beneficiary protections in access to care. In addition, we solicit comment on whether a specific appointment wait time limit for emergency or urgently needed services is duplicative of the mandatory coverage and access requirements in \u00a7 422.113. \nC. Medicare Advantage (MA) Network \nAdequacy: Access to Services (\u00a7 422.112) \nSection 1852(d)(1)(A) of the Act \nestablishes that an MA organization offering an MA plan may select the providers from whom the benefits under the plan are provided so long as the organization makes such benefits available and accessible to each individual electing the plan within the plan service area with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits. This is generally implemented at \u00a7 422.112(a), which provides that an MA organization that offers an MA coordinated care plan may specify the \nnetworks of providers from whom enrollees may obtain services if the MA organization ensures that all covered services are available and accessible under the plan. The regulation also includes specific additional requirements for MA organizations offering coordinated care plans related to the availability and accessibility of coverage. In addition, the statute and regulation apply these requirements to all benefits covered by the plan, including both basic and supplemental benefits. \nMore specifically, section \n1852(d)(1)(D) of the Act requires an MA organization to provide access to appropriate providers, including credentialed specialists, for medically necessary treatment and services, as a condition of the MA organization \nlimiting coverage to a specified network of providers. CMS implemented this statutory requirement at \u00a7 422.112(a)(1)(i), which provides that the MA organization offering a coordinated care plan must maintain and monitor a network of appropriate providers that is supported by written agreements and is sufficient to provide adequate access to covered services to meet the needs of the population served. In addition, \u00a7 422.112(a)(3) requires that the MA organization provide or arrange for necessary specialty care and arrange for specialty care outside of the plan\u2019s provider network when network providers are unavailable or inadequate to meet an enrollee\u2019s medical needs. \nHistorically, CMS has interpreted \nthese statutory and regulatory requirements to mean that in the event an in-network provider or service is unavailable or inadequate to meet an enrollee\u2019s medical needs, the MA organization must arrange for any medically necessary covered benefit outside of the plan provider network at in-network cost sharing for the enrollee. \nFor example, if an enrollee needs OTP services but there is no in-network OTP available, then the MA organization must arrange for the enrollee to go to an out-of-network OTP at in-network cost sharing. In our view, furnishing access out of network with higher cost sharing when the MA plan\u2019s network is inadequate or otherwise does not address the medically necessary benefit required by an enrollee is not consistent with section 1852(d)(1) of the Act. Enrollees should not bear a financial burden because of the inadequacy of the MA plan\u2019s network. This interpretation is reflected in CMS guidance in section 110.1.1 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM,\n68 \nand CMS has routinely emphasized this interpretation to MA organizations about their obligations whenever the need arises, for example, when an MA organization is undergoing a network change due to a provider termination. Therefore, MA organizations are familiar with the policy and should be applying it in the routine course of operations within their MA plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c0e61d6-35b4-4e64-988b-02dfb3c42deb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c0e61d6-35b4-4e64-988b-02dfb3c42deb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24fd0949-a5c0-4837-81cc-eb1d04fcef8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "20ef8f77e46a424ac02e7db233daec4e9a4b5a81d01e7ec7a232910e33071732"}, "2": {"node_id": "f44d11d5-2c20-4fc4-a573-a99703696896", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "40ec648789af312f717ff096a798001d187ebf85d763e2e81dabfda84398ce96"}}, "hash": "88bf24b1fd6e9f5d4436f815cb5d468999388b9cddc2779c552086bfb10ec0b0", "text": "It is important that MA organizations ensure adequate access to medically necessary covered benefits for enrollees when the plan network is not sufficient by both arranging or covering the out-of-network benefits and only charging in-network cost sharing for those out-of-network benefits. To reflect this important and well-established enrollee protection in the MA program, we are proposing to \namend \u00a7 422.112(a)(1) and (a)(3) to more clearly state the scope of the MA organization\u2019s obligation to ensure adequate access to medically necessary covered benefits. \nCurrently, the regulation text at \n\u00a7 422.112(a)(3) does not fully account for the scope of an MA organization\u2019s obligations when medically necessary benefits are only accessible out of network in two key ways. First, the regulation text refers to specialty care only, not all medically necessary covered benefits. This oversight does not align with the statutory requirement at section 1852(d)(1)(D) of the Act, which states broadly that the organization must provide access to \u2018\u2018appropriate providers, including credentialed specialists,\u2019\u2019 and does not limit the requirement to specialists only. Second, the aspect of maintaining in- network cost sharing when the MA organization arranges for the benefit outside of the network is not clearly stated in \u00a7 422.112(a)(3). Therefore, CMS proposes to amend \u00a7 422.112 to align more closely with current subregulatory policy and our implementation of section 1852(d) of the Act. \nCMS proposes to codify this policy by \nrevising \u00a7 422.112(a)(3) and adding new regulatory text to \u00a7 422.112(a)(1) to reflect the longstanding policy. Specifically, we propose to move the sentence requiring the MA organization to arrange for out-of-network care currently in paragraph (a)(3) to a new proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) and revise and supplement it with additional text to better state the full scope of the current policy. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) would require MA organizations offering coordinated care plans to arrange for any medically necessary covered benefit outside of the plan provider network, but at in- network cost sharing, when an in- network provider or benefit is \nunavailable or inadequate to meet an enrollee\u2019s medical needs. \nCMS currently monitors MA \norganization compliance with this existing policy through account management activities, complaint tracking and reporting, and auditing activities. These oversight operations alert CMS to any issues with access to care, and CMS may require MA organizations to address these matters if they arise. If finalized, CMS intends to continue these oversight operations to ensure MA organizations\u2019 compliance with the proposed regulation. \nThis proposal to amend \u00a7 422.112 \ncodifies the agency\u2019s existing interpretation of applicable law and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf740d1f-b2c5-453c-9af6-a623a3239654": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf740d1f-b2c5-453c-9af6-a623a3239654", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6274c4ac-b8a7-42a6-bc5a-e90577daf61c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8fa9cb727abc9cadc3f3a2d1b7c0296fd11ca4d100f18d134feba0e4ddaae5d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "a61973a8-05ed-4ce5-b9a5-c3e238a38e93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "af61f2a6122b7127964cc4d3a0104bdf10d82f8ecbf540c782bd0a2e1bc010e6"}}, "hash": "24e077a1a6f8cc79835308a1ce4fca5cbae0d6a295eb0ab1d5d0f3ebd8756a45", "text": "79494 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n69https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- \nGuidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/ \nmc86c04.pdf. 70https://www.cms.gov/cms-behavioral-health- \nstrategy. longstanding guidance. CMS has not \nbeen made aware of any issues of MA organization non-compliance with this policy and, as such, believes that MA organizations have been complying with this longstanding guidance. Therefore, the proposed amendment to \u00a7 422.112 would not impose new information \ncollection requirements (that is, reporting, recordkeeping, or third-party disclosure requirements), and we have not provided burden estimates in the Collection of Information section of this proposed rule. In addition, this provision is not expected to have any economic impact on the Medicare Trust Fund. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal, \nincluding on the accuracy of our assumptions regarding information collection requirements and regulatory impact. \nD. Enrollee Notification Requirements \nfor Medicare Advantage (MA) Provider Contract Terminations (\u00a7\u00a7 422.111 and 422.2267) \nAs provided in section 1852(d) of the \nAct and discussed in section 110.1.2.1 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM, MA organizations have considerable discretion to select the providers with whom to contract in order to build high- performing, cost effective provider networks.\n69This flexibility is also \napparent in how CMS is prohibited by section 1854(a)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act from requiring MA organizations to contract with a particular provider. Under our current regulations, MA organizations are able to make changes to these networks at any time during the contract year, as long as they continue to furnish all Medicare-covered services in a non- discriminatory manner, meet established access and availability standards and timely notice requirements, and ensure continuity of care for enrollees. Thus, an MA organization may terminate providers from its network during the plan year, which could impact enrollees who are patients of those providers. CMS requires notification to MA enrollees when a provider network participation contract terminates. Most notably, CMS\u2019s disclosure regulations at \u00a7 422.111(e) require MA organizations to make a good faith effort to provide written notice of a termination of a contracted provider at least 30 calendar days before the termination effective date to all enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the provider whose contract is terminating, irrespective of whether the termination was for cause or without cause. Additionally, \u00a7 422.111(e) requires that when a contract termination involves a primary care professional, all enrollees who are patients of that primary care professional must be notified. CMS established these enrollee notification requirements at \u00a7 422.111(e) over 22 years ago in the \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Medicare+Choice Program\u2019\u2019 final rule with comment period, which appeared in the Federal Register on June 29, 2000 (65 FR 40170) (hereinafter referred to as the June 2000 final rule). The MA program and its policies have evolved considerably since the inception of \u00a7 422.111(e). Therefore, CMS is proposing to revise this particular disclosure requirement by establishing specific enrollee notification requirements for no-cause and for-cause provider contract terminations and adding specific and more stringent enrollee notification requirements when primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations occur. CMS is also proposing to revise \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) to specify the requirements for the content of the notification to enrollees about a provider contract termination. \nFirst, we propose to clarify the \nregulatory text at \u00a7 422.111(e) regarding whether the provider contract termination was for cause or without cause. The regulation currently requires that the MA organization must make a good faith effort to notify enrollees at least 30 calendar days before the termination effective date, irrespective of whether the termination was for cause or without cause. This last clause does not consider \u00a7 422.202(d)(4), which outlines the timeframe requirement for suspension or termination of an MA organization\u2019s contract with a provider. An MA organization and a contracted provider are required by \u00a7 422.202(d)(4) to provide at least 60 days written notice to each other before terminating the contract without cause.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a61973a8-05ed-4ce5-b9a5-c3e238a38e93": {"__data__": {"id_": "a61973a8-05ed-4ce5-b9a5-c3e238a38e93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6274c4ac-b8a7-42a6-bc5a-e90577daf61c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8fa9cb727abc9cadc3f3a2d1b7c0296fd11ca4d100f18d134feba0e4ddaae5d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf740d1f-b2c5-453c-9af6-a623a3239654", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "24e077a1a6f8cc79835308a1ce4fca5cbae0d6a295eb0ab1d5d0f3ebd8756a45"}}, "hash": "af61f2a6122b7127964cc4d3a0104bdf10d82f8ecbf540c782bd0a2e1bc010e6", "text": "Consequently, because MA organizations are provided at least a 60- day notice of any no-cause provider contract termination, MA organizations should be able to timely meet a CMS established enrollee notification requirement that provides the MA organization a period of time that is less than 60 days to notify enrollees of the no-cause provider contract termination. Provider contract terminations that are for-cause, however, do not have an equivalent notification requirement as exists at \u00a7 422.202(d)(4) for MA organizations and contracted providers, which means that for-cause provider contract terminations could potentially \noccur with little notice or without any notice at all. In this case, it may not always be possible for the MA organization to notify enrollees in a reasonable amount of time before the provider contract termination effective date. Thus, we will preserve the phrase \u2018\u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2019 for enrollee notifications for for-cause provider contract terminations regarding the proposed timeframes. Under our proposal, the \u2018\u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2019 standard would apply to the timing component for for-cause provider contract terminations. However, we propose to remove \u2018\u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2019 for no-cause provider contract terminations. We believe that when an MA organization\u2019s contracted provider network changes, these enrollee notifications are essential for updating enrollees who are patients of the terminating providers. If an enrollee\u2019s provider is dropped from their network during the contract year, the enrollee must be notified so that they can decide how to proceed with the care they are receiving from that provider. By limiting the \u2018\u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2019 standard to the timing of for-cause provider contract terminations, we make it clear that issuing the notification to enrollees is a requirement that all MA organizations must follow without exception, but in the case of for-cause provider contract terminations, MA organizations must make a good faith effort to notify enrollees of the termination within the proposed timeframes. \nNext, we propose to add new \nprovisions to \u00a7 422.111(e) to address provider contract terminations that involve behavioral health providers. For purposes of this proposal, CMS considers various specialty types (both providers and facilities) as fitting the category of behavioral health providers so long as the treatment they furnish to \nenrollees is about behavioral health; these include but are not limited to psychiatrists, clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, inpatient psychiatric facilities, outpatient behavioral health clinics, OTPs, and MOUD-waivered providers approved by SAMHSA/FDA. As noted in section III.B.1. of this proposed rule, behavioral health is a top priority of both CMS and the broader administration. Specifically, CMS\u2019s goal is to improve access to behavioral health services and improve outcomes for people with behavioral health care needs. The CMS Behavioral Health Strategy seeks to remove barriers to care and services.\n70To support these \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bfa557a-e3b6-4279-bfa9-6329dcd4c352": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bfa557a-e3b6-4279-bfa9-6329dcd4c352", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb2881c6-d4fd-45cf-8e8d-b50346231899", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "341642341996e7f638dc4ab61f0234fc5befcfab30bb4c982828510ff307fb17"}, "3": {"node_id": "05ce24ca-2f96-4778-950c-0230e71ac6c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c10f3067e2aa1d84b3de066d73f787b76547a8b849a1a68d5d8cebf328e58b4d"}}, "hash": "5649bec0b59047629ed6bcffa0abf91636f2902ca237240995715255e377d163", "text": "79495 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n71https://jamanetwork.com/journals/ \njamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785383. \n72https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/ \narticles/10.1186/s12913-017-2719-9. \n73https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2021/ \n0500/p3.html#fpm20210500p3-b1. 74https://www.who.int/health-topics/primary- \nhealth-care#tab=tab_ 1. policy goals, using a behavioral health \nperspective, we have reexamined the MA enrollee notification requirements when a provider contract termination occurs at \u00a7 422.111(e). \nAccording to a recent study, because \nof the ongoing nature of patient/ provider relationships, when a provider leaves a plan\u2019s network, there is a potential disruption to the patient\u2019s treatment plan; this disruption could be especially problematic in the case of behavioral health treatment because this treatment may be longer in duration than that of physical health, and providers and patients are likely to need more time to develop mutual trust.\n71 \nTrusting relationships and continuity in the relationship between the patient and provider have shown to be central for behavioral health recovery, therefore, breaks in these relationships tend to cause patient stress, anxiety, and generally less opportunity to contribute to their treatment plan.\n72Thus, ensuring \ncontinuity of care in these situations becomes even more critical. As a consequence, sufficient enrollee notification is needed when a behavioral health provider leaves an MA network. We believe that affected enrollees need ample time to make decisions that may determine the trajectory of their behavioral health treatment. They may wish to continue seeing the terminated provider with whom they have already established a secure, comfortable relationship (potentially with higher out-of-network cost sharing), they may switch to a new provider in the network (forcing them to start a new relationship), or they may choose to stop treatment altogether (which could be detrimental to their health or perhaps fatal in the case of patients with suicidal ideation). Regardless of what action the enrollee takes, however, the enrollee needs to know that their behavioral health provider is leaving their plan\u2019s network prior to the contract termination date. \nA similar case is made for terminating \nprimary care providers both due to the fact that behavioral health services are often offered by primary care providers and the foundational role primary care providers play in an individual\u2019s overall health. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, up to 75 percent of primary care visits include aspects of behavioral health.\n73Primary \ncare is foundational because it integrates services to meet the patient\u2019s health needs throughout a lifetime, including key elements such as health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.\n74 \nFurthermore, CMS believes that the importance of a patient\u2019s relationship with their primary care provider is likely higher in managed care situations, such as MA, where referrals to specialists are often dependent on the primary care provider. Therefore, similar to behavioral health, continuity of care is essential, and sufficient enrollee notification is needed when a primary care provider leaves an MA network. For these reasons, we are proposing more stringent enrollee notification requirements when primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations occur. We expect positive impacts associated with improving communication about provider terminations from MA networks, including providing more time to MA enrollees with behavioral health conditions to make informed decisions about the future of their behavioral health treatment after their provider leaves their network. Enrollee benefits would result from increased enrollee protections when unexpected primary care and behavioral health network changes occur, and we would also expect to see benefits for providers and facilities who keep their patients informed if they are leaving their MA plan\u2019s network. \nTo address the aforementioned \nconcerns surrounding unexpected changes in MA primary care and behavioral health provider networks, we are proposing to add specific enrollee notification requirements for these types of provider contract terminations.

We first propose to add behavioral health providers to the current requirement at \u00a7 422.111(e) that all enrollees who are patients of a terminating primary care \nprovider must be notified (not just those enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the terminating provider, which is the case for all other specialty types), and expand the scope of this requirement to refer to all enrollees who have ever been patients of these terminating primary care or behavioral health providers (not just current patients). This addition would be reflected at proposed new paragraph (e)(1)(iii). Next, at proposed new paragraph (e)(1)(ii), we propose to require MA organizations to provide notice to enrollees at least 45 calendar days before the termination effective date for contract terminations that involve a primary care or behavioral health provider, which is longer than the 30-day standard for all other specialty types. Finally, we propose to require both written and telephonic notice for contract terminations that involve a primary care or behavioral health provider at new proposed paragraph (e)(1)(i), while only written notice is required for all other specialty types. We are proposing that both types of notice need to be provided at least 45 calendar days before the termination effective date. For the telephonic notice, we propose that the first telephone call be made to the enrollee at least 45 calendar days in advance. Under our proposal here, the MA organization would be required to continue attempting to reach the enrollee by telephone to provide notice of the termination of the provider from the network. We are not proposing a specific number of attempts required by the MA organization when they reach out to the enrollee by telephone and the call goes unanswered, but we are soliciting comment from MA organizations on how many telephonic attempts they believe are reasonable in this circumstance (for example, 1\u20135, 6\u2013 10, 11\u201315). To help inform our proposal, we are requesting qualitative feedback based on any MA organization\u2019s actual experience providing enrollees telephonic notice of primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations. \nThese new proposed requirements for \nMA organizations providing enrollees notice of primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations are intended to raise the standards for the stability of enrollees\u2019 primary care and behavioral health treatment. If finalized, these requirements would require MA organizations to notify all current enrollees who have ever been patients of the primary care or behavioral health provider or providers leaving their plan\u2019s network (regardless of whether these enrollees are patients currently seen on a regular basis, as that standard is established in proposed new paragraph (e)(2)(iii)), give enrollees more notice (and therefore more time) to decide how to proceed with their course of treatment, and provide enrollees with two different means by which they receive the notice from their MA organization. These strengthened enrollee notification requirements for primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations would generally increase enrollee protections when MA network changes occur. As discussed earlier, continuity of care is essential for both primary care and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c49f534-0b70-49f6-a470-959e02c06531": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c49f534-0b70-49f6-a470-959e02c06531", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0554b48c-4a43-4604-be9e-321196f43faa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37e84bb801f946cccc80ae7a63e3b640bf371aa4aacb44d88e138ded37fe980c"}, "3": {"node_id": "71c6ece8-d070-4f6b-9d13-80a9b8c84d73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ffe8ff788849447ae27baf598ee04445f033b77bb3df25bbf794657bb2a0252b"}}, "hash": "d866a32b7ae7b6443d4e1a6a2373322f09e2e4e7405ab50175c415812347757b", "text": "79496 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n75https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- \nGuidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/ \nmc86c04.pdf. 76https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- \nGuidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/ mc86c04.pdf. behavioral health, and consequently, \nadequate communication to enrollees is vital when network changes occur, so that patients of any terminating primary care or behavioral health providers can decide how to proceed with their course of treatment. By receiving adequate notice of the terminations, enrollees will be able to make an informed decision on how to proceed with their care and have more time to potentially locate and establish a relationship with a new provider. Thus, enrollees are protected from any undue harm that may result from an unexpected provider contract termination involving their primary care or behavioral health provider (for example, sudden lack of medication, psychotic episodes, suicide). The proposed enrollee notification \nrequirements are a positive step in the context of our policy for MA provider contact terminations. \nUnder our proposal, MA \norganizations will continue to be required to provide written notice at least 30 days before the termination effective date of a termination of a contracted provider that is not a primary care or behavioral health provider to all enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the terminating provider. We also propose to codify at \u00a7 422.111(e)(2)(iii) a definition of the phrase \u2018\u2018enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the provider whose contract is terminating.\u2019\u2019 CMS currently has sub-regulatory guidance in section 110.1.2.3 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM that defines this term as enrollees who are assigned to, currently receiving care from, or have received care within the past three months from a provider or facility being terminated, also called \u2018\u2018affected enrollees.\u2019\u2019\n75As this guidance \nhas been in place since 2016, and based on various MA organization inquiries we have received asking how CMS defines \u2018\u2018regular basis,\u2019\u2019 we believe the majority of MA organizations have come to adopt this CMS standard and use it routinely as they determine which enrollees to notify when provider contract terminations occur, in order to comply with \u00a7 422.111(e). Therefore, we propose to codify this definition at proposed \u00a7 422.111(e)(2)(iii). \nThe requirements for contract \nterminations that involve specialty types other than primary care or behavioral health (written notice only, at least 30 calendar days before the termination effective date, and to all enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the provider whose contract is terminating) would be set \nforth at new proposed \u00a7 422.111(e)(2). This provides a clear distinction for MA organizations between CMS\u2019s enrollee notification requirements for contract terminations that involve a primary care or behavioral health provider (at new proposed paragraph (e)(1)) and all other provider contract terminations. We reiterate that the beginning proposed revised regulatory text at \u00a7 422.111(e) also distinguishes between no-cause and for-cause provider contract terminations, with the former scenario prompting a requirement for MA organizations to provide the enrollee notifications and the latter requiring MA organizations to make a good faith effort to notify enrollees within the required timeframes. Regardless, whenever an \nMA organization notifies enrollees about a provider contract termination (whether it is with or without cause), CMS proposes that MA organizations must follow these new requirements outlined at proposed paragraphs (e)(1) and (2). \nFinally, regarding the content of the \nprovider termination notice, CMS\u2019s regulation at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) currently provides that the Provider Termination Notice is a required model communications material through which MA organizations must provide the information required under \u00a7 422.111(e). CMS has provided additional guidance regarding the content of the provider termination notice in section 110.1.2.3 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM.\n76Similar to the \ndefinition of \u2018\u2018affected enrollees,\u2019\u2019 these best practices have been in our guidance since 2016, thus we believe the majority of MA organizations likely already follow them as they develop the content of their provider termination notices. Therefore, we propose to codify the best practices for provider termination notices at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71c6ece8-d070-4f6b-9d13-80a9b8c84d73": {"__data__": {"id_": "71c6ece8-d070-4f6b-9d13-80a9b8c84d73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0554b48c-4a43-4604-be9e-321196f43faa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37e84bb801f946cccc80ae7a63e3b640bf371aa4aacb44d88e138ded37fe980c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c49f534-0b70-49f6-a470-959e02c06531", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d866a32b7ae7b6443d4e1a6a2373322f09e2e4e7405ab50175c415812347757b"}}, "hash": "ffe8ff788849447ae27baf598ee04445f033b77bb3df25bbf794657bb2a0252b", "text": "Specifically, we propose to make these requirements for the content of MA organizations\u2019 provider termination notices and also require MA organizations to include additional pieces of information in the notice. \nFirst, at proposed \n\u00a7 422.2267(e)(12)(ii)(A), we are proposing that the provider termination notice must inform the enrollee that the provider will no longer be in the network and the date the provider will leave the network. We have modeled this proposed regulatory text after the established precedent for the equivalent notice requirement for the Non-renewal Notice model communications material as provided at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(10)(ii)(A) (we refer readers to section III.P. of this proposed rule for our proposal to amend paragraph (e)(10) to make the Non- renewal Notice a standardized communications material). Next, we propose to codify a requirement to include the information currently described in the best practices guidance in Chapter 4 of the MMCM at proposed \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12)(ii)(B), (C), and (E), specifically: names and phone numbers of in-network providers that the enrollee may access for continued care (this information may be supplemented with information for accessing a current provider directory, including both online and direct mail options) (at proposed paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(B)); how the enrollee may request a continuation of ongoing medical treatment or therapies with their current provider (at proposed paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(C)); and the MA organization\u2019s call center telephone number, TTY number, and hours and days of operation (at proposed paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(E)). For proposed paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(B) and (C), we are proposing to use the same description for the relevant content that is currently found in CMS\u2019s guidance in Chapter 4 of the MMCM. However, for proposed paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(E), instead of using the existing Chapter 4 language (\u2018\u2018customer service number(s) where answers to questions about the network changes will be available\u2019\u2019), we have chosen to model the proposed regulatory text after the established precedent of a requirement for the Non- renewal Notice at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(10)(ii)(H). We believe that the proposed new language of \u2018\u2018call center telephone number, TTY number, and hours and days of operation\u2019\u2019 is more inclusive as it encompasses not just the customer service number but also the TTY number and operation times. \nIn addition, at proposed \n\u00a7 422.2267(e)(12)(ii)(D), we are proposing that the provider termination notice must provide information about the Annual Coordinated Election Period (AEP) and the MA Open Enrollment Period (MA\u2013OEP) and must explain that an enrollee who is impacted by the provider termination may contact 1\u2013 800\u2013MEDICARE to request assistance in identifying and switching to other coverage, or to request consideration for a special election period (SEP), as specified in \u00a7 422.62(b)(26), based on the individual\u2019s unique circumstances and consistent with existing parameters for this SEP.

We also solicit comment on alternative approaches; specifically, the adoption of a new SEP for this type of provider contract termination, with explicit standards for when termination of a provider from the network should serve as a basis for SEP eligibility. \nThe last proposal we are making \nregarding the provider termination notice requirements at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) concerns CMS\u2019s requirements for the telephonic notice that we are proposing MA organizations must provide to enrollees at least 45 days in advance of a primary care or behavioral health provider contract termination. Specifically, at proposed \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12)(iii), we propose that the telephonic notice of provider termination specified in proposed \u00a7 422.111(e)(1)(i) must relay the same information as the written provider termination notice as described in paragraph (e)(12)(ii) of \u00a7 422.2267. We believe that requiring the MA organization to communicate the same information on the primary care or behavioral health provider contract termination through two different channels\u2014a written letter and a telephone call\u2014will ensure that affected enrollees receive the information they need to decide how to proceed with their current course of treatment. The telephonic communication will reiterate the change occurring in the plan\u2019s network and the options the enrollee has moving forward in the absence of their current provider. \nThe provider termination notice is a \nmodel communications material which, per \u00a7 422.2267(c), is created by CMS as an example of how to convey enrollee information. When drafting this required communications material, MA organizations must: (1) accurately convey the vital information in the required material to the enrollee, \nalthough the MA organization is not required to use the CMS model material verbatim; and (2) follow CMS\u2019s order of content, when specified (see \u00a7 422.2267(c)(1) and (2)). While the regulation currently identifies the provider termination notice as a model communications material, CMS has not yet developed the model document for MA organizations to use. Rather, MA organizations have been expected to follow the current guidance in section 110.1.2.3 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM.\n77 \nGiven that we are now proposing new \nregulatory requirements for the content of these provider termination notices (including codifying existing best practices provided in CMS\u2019s guidance), CMS intends to create a model document for the provider termination notice that contains the requirements at proposed \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12), if finalized. We believe that this model document would be welcomed by MA organizations as it will provide a useful template that MA organizations may follow when developing their own provider termination notices. Our proposal for \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) specifies the required information, and the model document that CMS intends to develop would reflect this information as well. In addition, when developing provider termination notices, all MA organizations must follow the general communications materials and activities requirements outlined at \u00a7 422.2262 and the standards for required materials and content at \u00a7 422.2267(a). \nRegarding compliance monitoring for \nthe regulatory amendments proposed \nhere, CMS currently monitors MA organization compliance with the existing policies at \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(e) and 422.2267(e)(12) through account management activities, complaint tracking and reporting, and auditing activities. These oversight operations alert CMS to any issues with enrollees that did not receive adequate notice of a provider contract termination, and CMS may require MA organizations to address these matters if they arise. If finalized, CMS intends to continue these oversight operations to ensure MA organizations\u2019 compliance with the proposed regulation. In accordance with \u00a7 422.2261(c)(2), CMS may require submission or submission and approval of communications materials prior to use if additional oversight is warranted as determined by CMS based on feedback such as complaints or data gathered through reviews.

Introduction \nA majority of MA plans are \ncoordinated care plans, which is \ndefined at \u00a7 422.4(a) as a plan that includes a network of providers that are under contract or arrangement with an MA organization to deliver the benefit package approved by CMS. CMS regulations at \u00a7 422.202(b) require that each MA organization consult with network providers on the organization\u2019s medical policy, quality improvement programs, medical management procedures, and ensure that certain standards are met. For example, coordinated care plans must ensure that practice guidelines and utilization management guidelines are based on reasonable medical evidence or a consensus of health care professionals in the particular field; consider the needs of the enrolled population; are developed in consultation with contracting physicians; and are reviewed and updated periodically. Further, these guidelines must be communicated to providers and, as appropriate, to enrollees. \nCoordinated care plans are designed \nto manage cost, service utilization, and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0b3e0b3-6dea-4524-bac4-717e8884040c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0b3e0b3-6dea-4524-bac4-717e8884040c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5d94900-8928-47b6-ae96-1563b3db89bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fd486dc6c3b9aae78aad71c16a7ca68c49b493db6026df8f40a62bccefc98aee"}, "3": {"node_id": "fccaa4f8-e180-4862-83ab-828bb3eddc35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "88ff61ff4f6c2cb7b4a362617c55fd5948fecd209ab89ca2abce24cb3db2abe3"}}, "hash": "88abd2308d30dd551355e32da5ac29721147427dc3f634d834b0044bd1dfddca", "text": "79498 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n78The terms \u2018\u2018Traditional Medicare\u2019\u2019 and \n\u2018\u2018Original Medicare\u2019\u2019 are used interchangeably \nthroughout this section and both mean the Medicare Fee-For-Service program. \n79https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-18- \n00260.pdf. 80https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-18- \n00260.pdf, pg. 3. quality by ensuring that only medically \nnecessary care is provided. This is done in part through the use of utilization management tools, including prior authorization, expressly referenced at section 1852(c)(1)(G) and (c)(2)(B) of the Act. These tools are designed to help MA plans determine the medical necessity of services and minimize the furnishing of unnecessary services, thereby helping to contain costs and protect beneficiaries from receiving unnecessary care. Additionally, section 1852(g)(1)(A) of the Act states that MA plans shall have a procedure for making determinations regarding whether an enrollee is entitled to receive a health care service and that such determinations must be made on a timely basis; that provision applies to both prior authorization determinations and to post-service decisions about coverage and payment. \nIn addition, CMS regulations at \n\u00a7 422.101(a) and (b) require that MA plans provide coverage of all basic benefits (that is, services covered under Medicare Parts A and B, except hospice care and the cost of kidney acquisitions for transplant) and that MA plans must comply with Traditional Medicare national coverage determinations (NCDs) and local coverage determinations (LCDs) applicable in the MA plan\u2019s service area.\n78In recent \nyears, CMS has received feedback from various stakeholders, including patient groups, consumer advocates, providers and provider trade associations that utilization management in MA, especially prior authorization, can sometimes create a barrier to patients accessing medically necessary care. Stakeholder feedback has included concerns about the quality of MA plans\u2019 prior authorization decisions (for example, coverage denials being made by plan clinicians who do not have expertise in the field of medicine applicable to the requested service) and process challenges (for example, repetitive prior approvals for needed services for enrollees that have a previously-approved plan of care). \nIn addition, in April 2022, the Office \nof the Inspector General (OIG) released a report\n79titled, \u2018\u2018Some Medicare \nAdvantage Organization Denials of Prior Authorization Requests Raise Concerns About Beneficiary Access to Medically Necessary Care,\u2019\u2019 which summarized the results of a study by the OIG of MA plan denials of requests for prior authorization of services. The OIG found that some prior authorization requests were denied by MA plans, even though the requested services met Medicare coverage guidelines. In other cases, the OIG found that prior authorization requests were inappropriately denied due to errors that were likely preventable through process or system changes by MA organizations. Citing a concern that such inappropriate denials may prevent or delay beneficiaries from receiving medically necessary care, the OIG recommended that CMS: (1) issue new guidance on the appropriate use of MA organization clinical criteria in medical necessity reviews; (2) update its audit protocols to address the issues related to MA organizations\u2019 use of clinical criteria and/or examining particular service types; and (3) direct MA organizations to take steps to identify and address vulnerabilities that can lead to manual review errors and system errors.\n80 \nCMS understands that utilization \nmanagement tools are an important means to coordinate care, reduce inappropriate utilization, and promote cost-efficient care. In light of the feedback we have received from stakeholders and the findings in the OIG report, however, we have concluded that certain guardrails are needed to ensure that utilization management tools are used, and associated coverage decisions are made, in ways that ensure timely and appropriate access to medically necessary care for beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans. We \npropose to clarify requirements for the coverage criteria that MA plans use when making medical necessity determinations. We are also proposing additional beneficiary protection requirements in order to improve care continuity and integration of health care services and to increase plan compliance responsibilities with regards to utilization management policies.

This means that MA organizations may not limit coverage through the adoption of policies and procedures\u2014whether those policies and procedures are called utilization management and prior authorization or the standards and criteria that the MA organization uses to assess and evaluate medical necessity\u2014 when those policies and procedures result in denials of coverage or payment where the Traditional Medicare program would cover and pay for the item or service furnished to the beneficiary. In addition, this means that limits or conditions on payment and coverage in the Traditional Medicare program\u2014 such as who may deliver a service and in what setting a service may be provided, the criteria adopted in relevant NCDs and LCDs, and other substantive conditions\u2014apply to set the scope of basic benefits as defined in \u00a7 422.100(c). \nMA organizations have flexibility to \nfurnish and cover services without meeting all substantive conditions of coverage in Traditional Medicare, but that flexibility is limited to and in the form of supplemental benefits. As stated in the June 2000 final rule, MA organizations\u2019 flexibility to deliver care using cost-effective approaches should not be construed to mean that Medicare coverage policies do not apply to the MA program. If Traditional Medicare covers a service only when certain conditions are met, these conditions must be met in order for the service to be considered part of the Traditional Medicare benefits (that is, basic benefits) component of an MA plan. MA organizations may cover the same service when the conditions are not met, but these benefits would then be defined as supplemental benefits within the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 422.100(c)(2) and 422.102 and must be included in the supplemental benefits portion of the MA plan\u2019s bid. For example, when services are furnished by a type of provider other than the type of provider who may furnish the service in Traditional Medicare, those services are supplemental benefits. In this rule, we are proposing policies that would provide less flexibility for MA organizations to deny or limit coverage of basic benefits than provided in the 2000 final rule. However, as provided by section 1852(a)(3) of the Act and reflected in \u00a7\u00a7 422.100(c)(2) and 422.102, MA plans may cover benefits beyond what is covered (and when it is covered) under Traditional Medicare by offering supplemental benefits.

These clarifications aim to ensure access to medically necessary care while maintaining MA organizations\u2019 ability to apply utilization management that ensures clinically appropriate care. Additionally, our proposals address substantive rules regarding clinical coverage criteria for basic benefits and how they interact with utilization management policies, including revisions to existing regulations and adopting new regulations to ensure that MA enrollees receive the basic benefits coverage to which they are entitled and to ensure appropriate treatment of a benefit as a basic benefit or supplemental benefit for purposes of the bid under \u00a7 422.254. We solicit comment on whether our proposed regulatory provisions sufficiently address the requirements and limits that we describe in the preamble. \n2. Coverage Criteria for Basic Benefits \nIn interpreting requirements involving \ncoverage criteria, whether used for prior \nauthorization or post-service payment, CMS has a longstanding policy, discussed in sub-regulatory guidance (section 10.16 of Chapter 4 of the MMCM), that MA plans must make medical necessity determinations based on internal policies, which include coverage criteria that are no more restrictive than Traditional Medicare\u2019s national and local coverage policies and approved by a plan\u2019s medical director. In light of the previously discussed feedback and the OIG recommendation that we issue new guidance on the appropriate use of MA organization clinical criteria in medical necessity reviews, we propose to codify standards \nfor coverage criteria to ensure that basic benefits coverage for MA enrollees is no more restrictive than Traditional Medicare. Section 1862 of the Act requires original Medicare benefits to be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. Thus, in order to meet the statutory requirements at section 1852(a)(1) of the Act, which requires MA plans to cover A and B services, MA plan coverage criteria must \ndo the same. We also are proposing to amend \u00a7 422.101(b) and (c) to clarify the obligations and responsibilities for MA plans in covering basic benefits. \nSection 1852(a)(1) of the Act and CMS \nregulations at \u00a7 422.101(a) and (b) require all MA organizations to provide coverage of, by furnishing, arranging for, or making payment for, all items and services that are covered by Part A and Part B of Medicare and that are available to beneficiaries residing in the plan\u2019s service area. Section 422.101 requires MA organizations to comply with all NCDs; LCDs written by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) with jurisdiction for Medicare claims in the MA organization or plan\u2019s service area; and coverage instructions and guidance in Medicare manuals, instructions and other guidance documents unless those materials are superseded by regulations in part 422. \nWe propose to amend \u00a7 422.101(b)(2) \nby removing the reference to \u2018\u2018original Medicare manuals and instructions\u2019\u2019 and clarify that MA organizations must comply with general coverage and benefit conditions included in Traditional Medicare laws, unless superseded by laws applicable to MA plans, when making coverage decisions. Our proposal is designed to prohibit MA organizations from limiting or denying coverage when the item or service would be covered under Traditional Medicare and continue the existing policies that permit MA organizations to cover items and services more broadly than original Medicare by using supplemental benefits. In proposing this change to \u00a7 422.101(b)(2), we are reiterating that limits or conditions on payment and coverage in the Traditional Medicare program\u2014such as who may deliver a service and in what setting a service may be provided, the criteria adopted in relevant NCDs and LCDs, and other substantive conditions\u2014apply to define the scope of basic benefits. By removing the reference to \u2018\u2018original Medicare manuals and instructions,\u2019\u2019 we are not diminishing the content and value that these manuals and instructions provide in interpreting and defining the scope of Part A and Part B benefits.

We also propose to refer in \u00a7 422.101(b)(2) to specific Medicare regulations that include coverage criteria for Part A inpatient admissions, Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care, Home Health Services and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF) as examples of general coverage and benefit conditions in Traditional Medicare that apply to basic benefits in the MA program. The list of Medicare regulations referred to is not exhaustive and provides examples of substantive coverage and benefit conditions that apply to MA. In addition, we are also proposing to revise the current provision that states that Traditional Medicare coverage rules apply unless superseded by regulations in this part. We propose to revise that aspect of \u00a7 422.101(b)(2) to refer to laws applicable to MA plans in order to avoid implying that a Part 422 regulation could supersede an applicable statute. \nThe existing rule at \u00a7 422.101(c), \nwhich states that MA organizations may elect to furnish, as part of their Medicare covered benefits, coverage of post-hospital SNF care in the absence of the prior qualifying hospital stay is an example of a special rule in MA that deviates from coverage criteria articulated in Traditional Medicare. The regulation is based on section 1812(f) of the Act, which authorizes CMS to permit coverage of SNF care without the 3 day qualifying hospital stay in limited circumstances. (68 FR 50847\u201350848) This rule provides MA organizations the flexibility to cover SNF stays for MA enrollees that would not be otherwise coverable in Traditional Medicare, if the beneficiary had not met the prior qualifying hospital stay of 3 days prior to admission in the SNF. This special rule continues to apply in the MA program; however, we propose to redesignate this rule to paragraph (c)(2) of \u00a7 422.101 as part of our proposal to add a heading to \u00a7 422.101(c) and to expand the scope of the paragraph. We propose to add the heading \u2018\u2018Medical Necessity Determinations and Special Coverage Provisions\u2019\u2019 to \u00a7 422.101(c). As such, we propose to reassign the special rule for coverage of posthospital SNF in the absence of the prior qualifying hospital stay as \u00a7 422.101(c)(2).The proposed new heading for \u00a7 422.101(c), \u2018\u2018Medical Necessity Determinations and Special Provisions,\u2019\u2019 signals that paragraph (c) will address medical necessity criteria and special rules that apply to MA basic benefits that do not necessarily conform to coverage rules in Traditional Medicare. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15f20aad-e366-4db5-ac31-fc663e5f570a": {"__data__": {"id_": "15f20aad-e366-4db5-ac31-fc663e5f570a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9fc78c41-d11a-48c1-b924-e336f884836b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ec8ae8dc83fe64a7406c1c35db589c38858f9d6b53a527b58fcd781f63f44eb6"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd12d634-b36e-441e-9a02-9c6314b4ca58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "983f156bec0dbefa19ac68c1fecbe98d0ea22151d4bf6227d799ca8964f6673d"}}, "hash": "4a9e629a6bf7f77fb39b07f36ac09f4cf907033e4c6d167c74f492bb3ef59715", "text": "79500 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n81https://www.fda.gov/media/78504/download. \n82https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ \nPMC3278192/. We propose to codify at \n\u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(A) that MA organizations \nmust make medical necessity determinations based on coverage and benefit criteria as specified at \u00a7 422.101(b) and (c) and may not deny coverage for basic benefits based on coverage criteria that are not specified in \u00a7 422.101(b) or (c). This means that when an MA organization is making a coverage determination on a Medicare covered item or service, the MA organization cannot deny coverage of the item or service based on internal, proprietary, or external clinical criteria not found in Traditional Medicare coverage policies. It is our interpretation that certain utilization management processes, such as clinical treatment guidelines that require another item or service be furnished prior to receiving the requested item or service, would violate the proposed requirements at \u00a7 422.101(b) and (c), and thus, would be prohibited under this proposal unless it is specified within the applicable NCD or LCD or Medicare statute or regulation. We note that we are not proposing to revise \u00a7 422.136, which authorizes MA plans to use step therapy policies for Part B drugs under certain circumstances; in the next paragraph, we discuss the basis for authorizing step therapy for Part B drugs in \u00a7 422.136 in more detail. Clinical criteria that restrict access to a Medicare covered item or service unless another item or service is furnished first, when not specifically required in NCD or LCD, would be considered additional internal coverage criteria that are prohibited under this proposal. When MA plans are allowed to create internal coverage criteria as specified at proposed \u00a7 422.101(b)(6), the current evidence in widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature relied upon to make the coverage determination may recommend clinical treatment guidelines that require another item or service first. As long as the supporting widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature recommend another item or service first, this would be acceptable under our proposed policy. We discuss the proposal to add \u00a7 422.101(b)(6) later in this section of the proposed rule. \nIn a HPMS memo released August 7, \n2018, CMS announced that under certain conditions beginning in contract year 2019, MA plans may use utilization management tools such as step therapy for Part B drugs. In a May 2019 final rule (84 FR 23832), we codified MA organizations\u2019 ability to use step therapy for Part B drugs under certain conditions that protect beneficiaries and acknowledged that utilization \nmanagement tools, such as step therapy, can provide the means for MA plans to better manage and negotiate the costs of providing Part B drugs. \nWe clarified that, with respect to \nclinical concerns and interference with provider care, step therapy or other utilization management policies may not be used as unreasonable means to deny coverage of medically necessary services or to eliminate access to medically necessary Part B covered drugs. (84 FR 23856) The requirements in the 2019 rule, in combination with current MA program regulations, ensure access to Part B drugs and limit the potential for step therapy policies to interfere with medically necessary care. Organizations have been and remain subject to the MA regulations and must comply with national and applicable local coverage determinations. Step \ntherapy protocols cannot be stricter than an NCD or LCD with specified step therapy requirements. Thus, this proposal remains consistent with the 2019 rule in that plans must still comply with NCDs and LCDs when developing step therapy programs for Part B drugs. \nFinally, in the May 2019 final rule, we \ndid not authorize step therapy practices for Part A or Part B (non-drug) items or services and our proposal here will limit the ability of MA organizations to use such UM policies in connection with non-drug covered items or services that are basic benefits. There are a number of differences with step therapy for Part B drugs and step therapy for non-drug items and services.

Generally, MA organizations pay the provider for both the service of administering a Part B drug and the cost of the drug, but do not directly pay drug manufacturers or suppliers for the cost of the drug. MA organizations may negotiate pricing discounts or rebates with the manufacturer, who is not the entity that directly furnishes the Part B drug to enrollees and who is not ordinarily paid directly by the MA organization for what is furnished to enrollees. As we explained in the May 2019 final rule (84 FR 23858, 23863, and 23869), we believe that \u00a7 422.136 can put MA organizations in a stronger position to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices with drug manufacturers, reducing the cost sharing for the beneficiary. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, studies have demonstrated that increased cost sharing for medications can reduce patient adherence to those medications. Therefore, we are not proposing to revise our current regulations regarding Part B step therapy at this time. \nSimilar to MACs in Traditional \nMedicare, we expect MA organizations to make medical necessity decisions by using NCDs, LCDs, and other applicable coverage criteria in Medicare statutes and regulations to determine if an item or service is reasonable, necessary and coverable under Medicare Part A or Part B. In some circumstances, NCDs or LCDs expressly include flexibility that allows coverage in circumstances beyond the specific coverage or non- coverage indications that are listed in the NCD or LCD. For example, an NCD or LCD may state that the item or service can be covered when reasonable and necessary for the individual patient. When deciding whether an item or service is reasonable and necessary for an individual patient, we expect MA organizations to make medically necessary decisions in a manner that most favorably provides access to services for beneficiaries and aligns with CMS\u2019s definition of reasonable and necessary in the Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Chapter 13, section 13.5.4. This expectation applies to coverage determinations made before the item or service is provided (pre- certification/prior authorization), during treatment (case management), or after the item or service has been provided (claim for payment). As recommended by the OIG, this proposal clarifies the limited clinical coverage criteria can be applied to basic benefits and reinforces our longstanding policy that MA organizations may only apply coverage criteria that are no more restrictive than \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c7d2571-fa1a-494d-8f68-7d3e9d77c79d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c7d2571-fa1a-494d-8f68-7d3e9d77c79d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5b3651d-9d35-4b86-a256-5477390c01e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c7cb1b1bc34ee61a06e784fd7735fb38fdcda270b124d4e780a82898408bb746"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f71330a-485f-4962-ac85-eacad08c8d36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eeadea4838bee4697f2ea0258ebf81c0d635027e88c4c68e702ea6b80bbfe858"}}, "hash": "5dbf9e1bed41affdbdc3247e7a1acc12a755d3f87656e334111d1a6137581a23", "text": "79501 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n83Reference: https://www.idsociety.org/practice- \nguideline/clostridium-difficile/. \n84https://www.asam.org/asam-criteria. 85(for example, Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based \nMedicine levels of evidence https:// \nwww.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/levels-of-evidence/ oxford-centre-for-evidence-based-medicine-levels- of-evidence-march-2009andStrengthofRecommendationTaxonomyhttps://www.jabfm.org/ content/17/1/59#F1). Traditional Medicare coverage criteria \nfound in NCDs, LCDs, and Medicare laws. We reiterate that this proposal also applies to substantive coverage criteria and benefit conditions found in Traditional Medicare regulations, such as those governing inpatient admissions and transfers to post-acute care settings, which are not governed by NCD or LCD. Therefore, MAOs may only deny a request for Medicare-covered post-acute care services in a particular setting, if the MAO determines that the Traditional Medicare coverage criteria for the services cannot be satisfied in that particular setting. As we will discuss in section III.E.3 in this proposal, this does not restrict an MA organization\u2019s ability to use certain utilization management processes, like prior authorization or post claim review, to ensure items and services meet Medicare coverage rules; it simply limits the coverage criteria that an MA organization can apply to deny an item or service during those reviews. We solicit comment about the specificity of the coverage conditions in Traditional Medicare regulations and whether we should consider, and under what circumstances, allowing MA organizations to have internal coverage criteria in addition to requirements in current regulations. \nWe recognize that there are some Part \nA or Part B benefits that do not have applicable Medicare NCDs, LCDs, or specific traditional Medicare coverage criteria in regulation for MA plans to follow when making medical necessity determinations. Therefore, we propose at \u00a7 422.101(b)(6) that when coverage criteria are not fully established in applicable Medicare statute, regulation, NCD or LCD, an MA plan may create internal coverage criteria that are based on current evidence in widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature that is made publicly available. In creating these internal policies, we propose that MA organizations must follow similar rules that CMS and MACs must follow when creating NCDs or LCDs. Specifically, MA organizations must provide publicly available information that discusses the factors the MA organization considered in making coverage criteria for medical necessity determinations. \nSection 1862(l) of the Act requires the \nSecretary to issue publicly a discussion and explanation of the factors considered in making NCDs, after following a process that affords the public an opportunity to comment prior to implementation. We propose at \u00a7 422.101(b)(6) that MA organizations \nmust follow a somewhat similar process when creating internal plan coverage criteria by providing a publicly \naccessible summary of evidence that was considered during the development of the internal coverage criteria used to make medical necessity determinations, a list of the sources of such evidence, and include an explanation of the rationale that supports the adoption of the coverage criteria used to make a medical necessity determination. We are not proposing that MA organizations must provide a pre-determination explanation and opportunity for the public to comment on the MA organization\u2019s coverage criteria; however, providing a publicly accessible summary of the evidence, a list of the sources of evidence, and an explanation of the rationale for the internal coverage criteria will protect beneficiaries by ensuring that coverage criteria are rational and supportable by current, widely used treatment guidelines and clinical literature. This requirement provides further transparency into MA organizations\u2019 medical necessity decision making and is consistent with CMS\u2019s expectation that MA organizations develop and use coverage criteria in a way that aligns with Traditional Medicare. \nWe are also proposing at \n\u00a7 422.101(b)(6) a requirement that an MA organization\u2019s internal clinical criteria must be based on current evidence in widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature. Current, widely-used treatment guidelines are those developed by organizations \nrepresenting clinical medical specialties, and refers to guidelines for the treatment of specific diseases or conditions (such as referring to the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the Treatment of Clostridium Difficile\n83) or to determine appropriate \nlevel of care (such as the American Society of Addiction Medicine Criteria for placement,\n84continued stay, and \ntransfer or discharge of patients with addiction and co-occurring conditions).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f71330a-485f-4962-ac85-eacad08c8d36": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f71330a-485f-4962-ac85-eacad08c8d36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5b3651d-9d35-4b86-a256-5477390c01e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c7cb1b1bc34ee61a06e784fd7735fb38fdcda270b124d4e780a82898408bb746"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c7d2571-fa1a-494d-8f68-7d3e9d77c79d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5dbf9e1bed41affdbdc3247e7a1acc12a755d3f87656e334111d1a6137581a23"}}, "hash": "eeadea4838bee4697f2ea0258ebf81c0d635027e88c4c68e702ea6b80bbfe858", "text": "Clinical literature that CMS considers to be of high enough quality for the justification of internal coverage criteria include large, randomized controlled trials or cohort studies or all-or-none studies with clear results, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and specifically designed to answer the relevant clinical question, or large systematic reviews or meta-analyses summarizing the literature of the specific clinical question published in a peer-reviewed journal with clear and consistent results. Evidence that is unpublished, is a case series or report, \nor derived solely from internal analyses within the MA organization, or that does not comply with the standards, as previously described, would not represent proper justification for instituting internal coverage guidelines that would restrict access to care. This evidentiary standard is overall consistent with published frameworks\n85 \nthat rank the reliability of different types of studies in the clinical literature.

Per CMS regulations at \u00a7 422.112(a)(6)(ii), MA plans must have policies and procedures that allow for individual medical necessity determinations. As a result, an MA organization\u2019s coverage rules, practice guidelines, payment policies, and utilization management policies should be applied to make individual medical necessity determinations based on the individual circumstances for the enrollee and item or benefit to be covered. Chapter 4 of the MMCM, section 10.16, provides that \nMA organizations make coverage determinations that are based on: (1) the medical necessity of plan-covered services based on coverage policies (this includes coverage criteria no more restrictive than traditional Medicare described previously and proposed at \u00a7 422.101(b)(6)); (2) where appropriate, involvement of the plan\u2019s medical director per \u00a7 422.562(a)(4); and (3) the enrollee\u2019s medical history (for example, diagnoses, conditions, functional status)), physician recommendations, and clinical notes. We are proposing to codify these existing standards for medical necessity decision making at \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i) and propose some new requirements to connect medical necessity determinations to our new requirements at \u00a7 422.101(b).

Second, we propose at \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i)(B) to require MA organizations to consider whether the item or service is reasonable and necessary under 1862(a)(1) of the Act. We note that this has been a longstanding policy in MA based on how section 1852 of the Act requires MA plans to cover items and services for which benefits are available under original Medicare, however we believe it is important to acknowledge this in the context of MA organization decisions involving medical necessity. Third, we propose to codify existing policy at \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i)(C) that MA organizations consider the enrollee\u2019s medical history (for example, diagnoses, conditions, functional status), physician recommendations, and clinical notes. Finally, consistent with current requirements at \u00a7 422.562(a)(4), we propose at \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i)(D) that MA organizations\u2019 medical directors be involved in ensuring the clinical accuracy of medical necessity decisions where appropriate. We solicit comments on when it would be appropriate for the MA organization\u2019s medical director to be involved, in light of how \u00a7 422.562(a)(4) requires the medical director to be responsible for ensuring the clinical accuracy of all organization determinations and reconsiderations involving medical necessity. \nAuthority for MA organizations to use \nutilization management policies with regard to basic benefits is subject to the mandate in section 1852(a)(1) of the Act that MA plans cover Medicare Part A and Part B benefits (subject to specific, limited statutory exclusions) and, thus, to CMS\u2019s authority under section 1856(b) of the Act to adopt standards to carry out the MA provisions. We believe these proposals will further implement the requirements set forth in section 1852 of the Act and \u00a7\u00a7 422.100 and 422.101, which require MA organizations to furnish all reasonable and necessary Part A and B benefits. These proposed requirements for how MA organizations make coverage decisions will ensure that MA organizations provide equal access to Part A and Part B benefits as provided in the Traditional Medicare program; overall our proposals mean that MA organizations will not be able to deny coverage for basic benefits using coverage criteria that is not consistent with coverage criteria in Medicare statutes, regulations, NCDs and LCDs or \nthat is not consistent with the limitations proposed in \u00a7 422.101(b)(6). \nWe affirm that coordinated care plans \nmay continue to include mechanisms to control utilization, such as prior authorization, referrals from a gatekeeper for an enrollee to receive services within the plan, and, subject to the rules on physician incentive plans at \u00a7\u00a7 422.208 and 422.210, financial arrangements that offer incentives to providers to furnish high quality and cost-effective care in addition to the coverage criteria that comply with \u00a7 422.101(b). We affirm that MA organizations may furnish a given service using a defined network of providers, some of whom may not see patients in Traditional Medicare. Further, we affirm that MA organizations may encourage patients to see more cost-effective provider types than would be the typical pattern in Traditional Medicare (as long as those providers are working within the scope of practice for which they are licensed to provide care and comply with the provider antidiscrimination rules set forth under \u00a7 422.205). For instance, MA organizations may offer more favorable cost sharing for certain provider types within their network. \nWe also stated in the June 2000 final \nrule that when a health care service can be Medicare-covered and delivered in more than one way, or by more than one type of practitioner, that an MA plan could choose how the covered services will be provided.

(We are proposing to reserve paragraph (c)(1)(ii) to provide flexibility in modifying the limits on MA medical necessity policies in the future.) For example, if an MA patient is being discharged from an acute care hospital and the attending physician orders post- acute care at a SNF because the patient \nrequires skilled nursing care on a daily basis in an institutional setting, the MA organization cannot deny coverage for the SNF care and redirect the patient to home health care services unless the patient does not meet the coverage criteria required for SNF care in \u00a7\u00a7 409.30\u2013409.36 and proposed \u00a7 422.101(b) and (c). \nIn order to demonstrate how these \npolicies will apply to actual cases, we discuss these proposed requirements in the context of two case examples that were cited in the OIG report. In the first case, an MA patient was a smoker and had a history of lung nodules and the provider ordered a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest. NCD 220.1\n86identifies Medicare \ncoverage and limitations for CT scans. In this specific case, the MA organization cited internal clinical criteria that limited CT scans based on the size of nodules and the receipt of chest X-rays. In our proposed policy, the internal criteria applied by the MA organization would be prohibited because there is no provision in the NCD that requires other diagnostic tests, such as a chest X-ray, to be tried before CT scanning is used. In order to appropriately deny this request for a CT scan under our proposed policy, the MA organization would need to identify why the CT scan, as the initial diagnostic test, was not reasonable and necessary based on the medical necessity determination requirements at the proposed 422.101(1)(A) through (D). \nIn another case, an MA patient had a \nhistory of dementia, hypertension and was legally blind due to glaucoma. The patient was admitted to the acute-care hospital for worsening dementia and acute agitation. The acute-care hospital requested that the patient be discharged to a SNF, but the MA organization denied the request based on the MA organization\u2019s internal clinical criteria that determined that the patient did not have a need for skilled care. The specific conditions for meeting level of care requirements at a SNF, the criteria for skilled services, and the need for skilled services can be found at 42 CFR 409.30\u2013409.36. The internal clinical criteria used by the MA organization in this case were not identified by the OIG. However, if the internal criteria were not consistent with the criteria listed in \u00a7\u00a7 409.30\u2013409.36, it would be prohibited under our proposal. The OIG noted that because the patient required physician supervision and access to physical and occupational therapy, the MA organization should have covered the SNF care requested. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b158dd4-339f-4087-af51-39672d1ce7b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b158dd4-339f-4087-af51-39672d1ce7b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b692978-5f3f-4cb8-8952-4613f6e13505", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bd5b3f786e5ccaaf4f9fabd0724c793b47c05e3c86a9e530cf228a2601d50f98"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1e55bc5-73ed-44fa-b0ad-de5215528a9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0cb38f9eff71cf0371c31ce11510fa50ded07bd3a2f453728e9146565f8f889d"}}, "hash": "d4dc8b15312eb99dc5f04a4f3d4b0ab97d3cc2088e8d6411c999edf07da82be0", "text": "79503 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n87https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage- \ndatabase/view/ncd.aspx?NCDId=373.

The OIG stated in their report that \u2018\u2018CMS guidance is not sufficiently detailed to determine whether MA organizations may deny authorization based on internal MA organization clinical criteria that go beyond Medicare coverage rules.\u2019\u2019 As a result, in this proposal we are making it clear that MA organizations may not deny authorization based on internal MA organization clinical criteria that go beyond Medicare coverage rules or comply with proposed \u00a7 422.101(b)(6) addressing standards for when MA internal coverage rules are permissible. However, we are unable to quantify or predict how many MA organizations are currently operating in a manner that conforms with our proposal. We solicit comment from stakeholders on the full scope of this burden. \n3. Appropriate Use of Prior \nAuthorization \nExcept for emergency, urgently \nneeded, and stabilization services (\u00a7 422.113(a)), and out-of-network services covered by MA PPO plans, all services covered by MA coordinated care plans (including MSA network plans, which are coordinated care plans under 422.4(a)(iii)(D)), may be subject to prior authorization. In addition, MA PFFS and MA MSA plans are not permitted to use prior authorization policies or \u2018\u2018prior notification\u2019\u2019 policies that reduce cost sharing for enrollees based on whether the enrollee or provider notifies the PFFS or MSA plan in advance that services will be furnished. See \u00a7 422.4(a)(2)(i)(B) and \n(a)(3)(iv). Appropriate prior authorization should only be used to confirm the presence of diagnoses or other medical criteria and to ensure that the furnishing of a service or benefit is medically necessary or, for \nsupplemental benefits, clinically appropriate and should not function to delay or discourage care. We propose to codify this at new \u00a7 422.138(a). Specifically, we are proposing a new \u00a7 422.138(a) to provide that a coordinated care plan may use prior authorization processes for basic benefits and supplemental benefits only when the prior authorization processes are consistent with new \u00a7 422.138. We propose to use the term \u2018\u2018processes\u2019\u2019 to include prior authorization policies and procedures that address any and all aspects of how prior authorization is used by an MA organization in a coordinated care plan. We are also proposing a new \u00a7 422.138(b)(1) through (3) to limit the use of prior authorization processes only to confirm the presence of diagnoses or other medical criteria that are the basis for coverage determinations for the specific item or service, to ensure basic benefits are medically necessary based on standards specified in \u00a7 422.101(c)(1), or to ensure that the furnishing of supplemental benefits is clinically appropriate. This is consistent with longstanding guidance in Chapter 4, section 30.2, of the MMCM (and also stated in the CY 2021 Final Rule [86 FR 5864]) that supplemental benefits must be medically necessary. \nWe are aware that Special \nSupplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCI) may be non- primarily health related. Regular supplemental benefits must be medically necessary, but SSBCI need to have a reasonable expectation of \nimproving or maintaining the health or overall function of the enrollee as required at \u00a7 422.102(f)(1)(ii)) and discussed in CY2020 Final Rule (85 FR 33796). \nTo illustrate how these proposed prior \nauthorization policies would work, we discuss an example regarding coverage of acupuncture.

Here, an MA plan may require prior authorization, before authorizing treatment as a covered basic benefit, to verify the patient\u2019s pain is not the result of \nmetastatic, inflammatory, infectious disease, as specified in the NCD. In this example, the plan is using the prior authorization to confirm a diagnosis specified in appropriate Medicare Part B coverage policy (in this case an NCD). Hence, prior authorization is used in this case to verify appropriate use of clinical standards and thus ensuring appropriate care, which is acceptable. Another example would be a beneficiary scheduled to undergo a non-emergency surgery. Here, an MA plan may use prior authorization before approving the surgery to review the beneficiary\u2019s medical history to verify that the surgery is medically necessary based on \u00a7 422.101(c)(1). In this example, the plan is using prior authorization to ensure that the surgery is clinically appropriate. (It is worth noting that if the surgery is an emergency or urgent surgery, or for stabilization purposes, then prior authorization would not be allowed). \nCMS guidance (section 10.16 of \nChapter 4 of the MMCM) currently states that if the plan approved the furnishing of a service through an advance determination of coverage, it may not deny coverage later on the basis of a lack of medical necessity. This means that when an enrollee or provider requests a pre-service determination and the plan approves this pre-service determination of coverage, the plan cannot later deny coverage or payment of this approval based on medical necessity. The only exception here would be medical necessity determinations for which the plan has the authority to reopen the decision for good cause or fraud or similar fault per the reopening provisions at \u00a7 422.616. This has been longstanding sub- regulatory guidance (section 10.16 of Chapter 4) that we are proposing to codify at \u00a7 422.138(c) to ensure the reliability of an MA organization\u2019s pre- service medical necessity determination. Therefore, we do not believe there is any additional impact. We solicit stakeholder input on the reasonableness of this assumption. We also solicit comment whether combining all of our proposals on prior authorization (here and in section III.E.4 of this proposed rule) in proposed new \u00a7 422.138 would make applying and understanding these requirements clearer for the public and MA organizations. \nFinally, we also remind MA plans \nthat section 1852(b) of the Act states that an MA plan may not deny, limit, or condition the coverage or provision of \nbenefits under this part, for individuals permitted to be enrolled with the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a16a7a87-051f-4f21-930d-a9e972dbaa93": {"__data__": {"id_": "a16a7a87-051f-4f21-930d-a9e972dbaa93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cffb5479-3bfc-4bf7-8467-e7b02675843b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b607434823319be45e2137a880be1bfa0e2eabd14dfe93bcca944b485be53c8e"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd55cbdf-87ef-487d-a1e0-a70b681225d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4360e047d81c64834ea95e694b49bd874b0cf9f25d5e1e6ae6bd77fa90a23ea5"}}, "hash": "a80b12822c752b9371f37b3f964611d73a8eb6dfd52b962b72fbace65b5183f1", "text": "79504 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \norganization under this part, based on \nany health status\u2013related factor described in section 2702(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, per CMS regulations at \u00a7 422.100(f)(2), plan benefit designs may not discriminate against beneficiaries, promote discrimination, discourage enrollment or encourage disenrollment, steer subsets of Medicare beneficiaries to particular MA plans, or inhibit access to services. We consider prior authorization policies to be part of the plan benefit design, and therefore cannot be used to discriminate or direct enrollees away from certain types of services. \nA complete estimation of impact on \nthis provision cannot be given because we require detailed knowledge of proprietary plan information on the frequency and specific services for which prior authorization is done in each plan. We solicit comment from stakeholders on the impact and any additional information that would assist CMS in making an estimation. \n4. Continuity of Care \nIn addition to the requirements of \nsection 1852(d) of the Act, \u00a7 422.112(b) \nrequires MA organizations that offer coordinated care plans to ensure continuity of care and integration of services through arrangements with contracted providers. Requirements in \u00a7 422.112(b)(1) through (b)(7) detail \nspecific arrangements with contracted providers by which MA coordinated care plans are to ensure effective continuity and integration of health care services for their enrollees. This includes requiring MA coordinated care plans to have policies and procedures that provide enrollees with an ongoing source of primary care, programs for coordination of plan services with community and social services, and procedures to ensure that the MA coordinated care plan and its provider network have the information required for effective and continuous patient care and quality review. \na. Stakeholder Feedback \nStakeholders have communicated to \nCMS that MA coordinated care plans\u2019 \nprior authorization processes sometimes require enrollees to interrupt ongoing treatment. We also have received complaints that MA plans require repetitive prior approvals for needed services for enrollees that have a previously-approved plan of care or are receiving ongoing treatments for a chronic condition. When MA plans require repetitive prior approvals, enrollees may face delays in receiving medically necessary care or experience gaps in care delivery that threaten an \nenrollee\u2019s health. \nb. Proposed Regulatory Changes \nWe believe the inclusion of additional \ncontinuity of care requirements at \n\u00a7 422.112 will help ensure coordinated care plans comply with and implement the statutory requirement (in section 1852 of the Act) that MA plans provide access to all medically necessary Medicare covered benefits. We propose to add a new paragraph (b)(8)(i) and (ii) at \u00a7 422.112 to set two new requirements for the use of prior authorization by MA coordinated care plans for covered Part A and B services (that is, basic benefits as defined in \u00a7 422.100(c)). Section 422.112(b) requires MA organizations offering coordinated care plans to ensure continuity of care and integration of services through arrangements with contracted providers that include the types of policies, procedures and systems that are specified in current paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7). First, we propose, at \u00a7 422.112(8)(i) that MA coordinated care plans must have, as part of their arrangements with contracted providers, policies for using prior authorization for basic benefits. These prior authorization policies must reflect that all approved prior authorizations must be valid for the duration of the entire approved prescribed or ordered course of treatment or service. To illustrate this, if an MA coordinated care plan has approved a prescribed or ordered course of treatment or service for which the duration is 90 days, then the MA coordinated care plan\u2019s prior authorization approval must apply to the full 90 days, and the MA coordinated care plan may not subject this treatment or service to additional prior authorization requirements prior to the completion of the approved 90- day treatment or service. To further illustrate, if the MA coordinated care plan approves a prescribed or ordered course of treatment for a series of five sessions with a physical therapist, the MA coordinated care plan may not subject this active course of treatment or service to additional prior authorization requirements. We solicit comment on whether the prior authorization should be required to be valid for the duration of the prescribed order or ordered course of treatment provided that the criteria in proposed \u00a7 422.101(b) and (c) are met.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd55cbdf-87ef-487d-a1e0-a70b681225d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd55cbdf-87ef-487d-a1e0-a70b681225d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cffb5479-3bfc-4bf7-8467-e7b02675843b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b607434823319be45e2137a880be1bfa0e2eabd14dfe93bcca944b485be53c8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a16a7a87-051f-4f21-930d-a9e972dbaa93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a80b12822c752b9371f37b3f964611d73a8eb6dfd52b962b72fbace65b5183f1"}}, "hash": "4360e047d81c64834ea95e694b49bd874b0cf9f25d5e1e6ae6bd77fa90a23ea5", "text": "Second, at \n\u00a7 422.112(b)(8)(ii)(A), we define \u2018\u2018course of treatment\u2019\u2019 as a prescribed order or ordered course of treatment for a specific individual with a specific condition, as outlined and decided upon ahead of time, with the patient \nand provider. (A course of treatment may, but is not required to be part of a treatment plan). We also propose to define an \u2018\u2018active course of treatment\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 422.112(b)(8)(ii)(B) as a course of treatment in which a patient is actively seeing a provider and following the prescribed or ordered course of treatment as outlined by the provider for a particular medical condition. \nAdditionally, we propose at \n\u00a7 422.112(b)(8)(i)(B) that MA organizations offering coordinated care plans must have, as part of their arrangements with contracted providers, policies for using prior authorization that provide for a minimum 90-day transition period for any ongoing course(s) of treatment when an enrollee has enrolled in an MA coordinated care plan after starting a course of treatment, even if the course of treatment was for a service that commenced with an out- of-network provider. This includes enrollees who are new to an MA coordinated care plan having either been enrolled in a different MA plan with the same or different parent organization, or an enrollee in Traditional Medicare and joining an MA coordinated care plan, and beneficiaries new to Medicare and enrolling in an MA coordinated care plan. The MA organization must not disrupt or require reauthorization for an active course of treatment for new plan enrollees for a period of at least 90 days. \nThis means that for a minimum of 90 \ndays, when an enrollee switches to a new MA coordinated care plan, any active course of treatment must not be subject to any prior authorization requirements. During the initial 90 days of an enrollee\u2019s enrollment with an MA coordinated care plan, the MA coordinated care plan cannot subject any active course of treatment (as defined at the proposed \u00a7 422.112(b)(8)(ii)(B)) to additional prior authorization requirements, even if the service is furnished by an out-of- network provider. We expect any active course of treatment to be documented in the enrollee\u2019s medical records so that the enrollee, provider, and MA plan can track an active course of treatment and avoid disputes over the scope of this proposed new requirement. We also intend that an active course of treatment can include scheduled procedures regardless whether there are specific visits or activities leading up to the procedure.

The planned surgery is a part of an active course of treatment and thus cannot be subjected to prior authorization by the MA coordinated care plan in which the beneficiary has newly enrolled. In proposing to limit the way MA coordinated care plans use prior authorization for enrollees undergoing an active course of treatment, CMS seeks to ensure the availability and accessibility of basic benefits, which is consistent with section 1852 of the Act. CMS is proposing to use a 90 day transition policy here because it mirrors Part D transition requirements and using the same period will ensure consistency across the MA and Part D programs. In addition, use of one consistent transition period will likely make it easier for new enrollees to understand their transition coverage. We solicit public comment on alternative timeframes for transition periods of ongoing treatment, including the clinical and economic justification for alternative proposals. \nCMS has authority to adopt standards \nto carry out the applicable MA provisions in Title XVIII of the Act and to add new contract terms that we find necessary, appropriate, and not inconsistent with the statute in sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act. In addition, section 1854(a)(5) and (6) of the Act provide that CMS is not obligated to accept every bid submitted and may negotiate with MA organizations regarding the bid, including benefits. To the extent that these new minimum standards for MA organizations and how they cover benefits would not implement section 1852 of the Act, establish standards to carry out the MA program under section 1856(b) of the Act (which CMS does not concede as these are important protections to ensure that MA enrollees receive Medicare covered services), or be contract terms that we are authorized to adopt under section 1857(e)(1) of the Act, we believe that our negotiation authority in section 1854 of the Act permits creation of minimum coverage requirements. While the rules proposed here do not limit our negotiation authority (which is addressed in \u00a7 422.256), they provide minimum standards for an acceptable benefit design for CMS to apply in reviewing and evaluating bids, in addition to establishing important protections to ensure that enrollees have access to medically necessary items and services that are covered under Part A and Part B. We note that CMS has similar negotiation authority for the Part D program at section 1860D\u201311(d)(2) of \nthe Act. CMS implemented a similar policy regarding coverage during a transition period using that authority and a similar explanation in the 2005 final rule (70 FR 4193). Our proposal is similar to Part D transitional requirements currently codified at \u00a7 423.120(b), which require Part D sponsors to provide for an appropriate transition process for enrollees prescribed Part D drugs that are not on their Part D plan\u2019s formulary (including Part D drugs that are on a sponsor\u2019s formulary, but require prior authorization or step therapy under a plan\u2019s utilization management rules). Similar to Part D, as explained previously, we would establish a transition period for services provided as an active course of treatment to enrollees who switch from traditional Medicare to an MA plan and for when an enrollee switches from an MA a plan to another MA plan as described previously. Our experience with oversight and monitoring of the Part D program indicates that the transition policy has proved effective in ensuring continuity of care for Part D beneficiaries. Based on this experience, we believe it is appropriate to incorporate a similar beneficiary protection and coverage requirement in the MA program. \nCoordinated care plans are already \nrequired to ensure continuity of care and integration of services through arrangements with contracted providers at 422.112(b). Therefore, some MA organizations may already be exercising discretion to waive prior authorization for enrollees undergoing an active course of treatment. However, CMS has received anecdotal feedback from stakeholders that care transitions can be difficult due to MA plan processes that require new coverage decisions when a patient transitions from one MA plan to another. However, we are not aware of the extent to which current MA plans are already ensuring continuity of care in this way nor do we have a strong basis upon which to quantify how often \nthis type of transition occurs. Therefore, we are not quantifying the impact in this proposed rule and we solicit stakeholder input on both of these assumptions: that some MA plans are providing continuity of care as defined in the proposed \u00a7 422.112(b)(8) today and the lack of available data by which to quantify it. \n5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa3650a-2221-462a-99b0-7529779b7f32": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa3650a-2221-462a-99b0-7529779b7f32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3571eae7-dc70-47c3-8ac3-13805fed48fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "12ce0fe9739252a031338ef94a7754db8ba6c7da862669cbd2561cfcc54cb0a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b7fa5b5-7840-4fc8-b8c3-ef3d5a5767f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f76cef106c3f5849f67e2a51340044f7a141c82774302a5e67a141d6859c827e"}}, "hash": "2fa298ba263d831cd9b8aeeb5d4286b160d818dba5ba43cd5e33fbb18903d81a", "text": "5. Mandate Annual Review of \nUtilization Management (UM) Policies by a UM Committee (\u00a7 422.137) \nWe are proposing procedural \nimprovements to ensure that utilization management policies are reviewed on a \ntimely basis and have the benefit of provider input. Any authority for MA organizations to use utilization management policies with regard to basic benefits is subject to the mandate in section 1852(a)(1) of the Act that MA plans cover Medicare Part A and Part B benefits (subject to specific, limited statutory exclusions) and, thus, to CMS\u2019s authority under section 1856(b) of the Act to adopt standards for to carry out the MA provisions. In light of the feedback we have received and our concern that enrollees may be facing unreasonable barriers to needed care, we propose to require MA organizations to establish a Utilization Management (UM) committee to operate similar to a Pharmacy and Therapeutics, or P&T, committee. We propose to add requirements pertaining to this UM committee in a new regulation at \u00a7 422.137. \na. Review and Approval of UM Policies \nAt \u00a7 422.137(a), we propose that an \nMA organization that uses utilization \nmanagement (UM) policies, such as prior authorization, must establish a UM committee that is led by an MA plan\u2019s medical director (described in \u00a7 422.562(a)(4)). Section 422.562(a)(4) requires every MA organization to employ a medical director who is responsible for ensuring the clinical accuracy of all organization determinations and reconsiderations involving medical necessity and establishes that the medical director must be a physician with a current and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, Territory, Commonwealth of the United States (that is, Puerto Rico), or the District of Columbia. We are also proposing, at \u00a7 422.137(b), that an MA plan may not use any UM policies for basic or supplemental benefits on or after January 1, 2024, unless those policies and procedures have been reviewed and approved by the UM committee. This proposal would ensure that plan policies and procedures meet the standards set forth in this proposed rule beginning with the contract year after \nthe finalization of this proposed rule. We anticipate that there will be sufficient time between our issuance of a final rule and January 1, 2024, for each MA organization to engage in the necessary administrative activity to establish the UM committee and have its existing UM policies reviewed and, if they meet the standards in this proposed regulation, approved for use. \nWe propose the committee \nresponsibilities at \u00a7 422.137(d).

We propose at \u00a7 422.137(d)(1)(i) through (iii) that such review must consider\u2014 \n\u2022The services to which the \nutilization management applies; \n\u2022Coverage decisions and guidelines \nfor original Medicare, including NCDs, LCDs, and laws; and \n\u2022Relevant current clinical \nguidelines.We propose at \n\u00a7 422.137(d)(2)(i) though (iv) the committee approve only utilization management policies and procedures that: \n\u2022Use or impose coverage criteria that \ncomply with the requirements and standards at \u00a7 422.101(b); \n\u2022Comply with requirements and \nstandards at \u00a7 422.138(a)\u2013(c); \n\u2022Comply with requirements and \nstandards at \u00a7 422.202(b)(1); and \n\u2022Apply and rely on medical \nnecessity criteria that comply with \u00a7 422.101(c)(1). \nCurrently, \u00a7 422.202(b) requires MA \norganizations to establish a formal mechanism to consult with the physicians who have agreed to provide services under the MA plan offered by the organization, regarding the organization\u2019s medical policy, quality improvement programs and medical management procedures; that formal mechanism for consultation must ensure that certain standards are met. Specifically, \u00a7 422.202(b)(1)(i) through (iv) require that MA plan practice guidelines and UM guidelines must: (i) be based on reasonable medical evidence or a consensus of health care professionals in the particular field; (ii) consider the needs of the enrolled population; (iii) be developed in consultation with contracting physicians; and (iv) be reviewed and updated periodically. We are proposing to modify \u00a7 422.202(b)(1)(i) to align it with our standard for creating internal coverage criteria. We therefore propose to replace the requirement that practice and UM guidelines be based on reasonable medical evidence or a consensus of health care professionals in the particular filed with a requirement that UM guidelines be based on current widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature. This is consistent with the proposed coverage criteria requirements at \u00a7 422.101(b)(6), which are discussed in detail in section III.E.2. of this proposed rule. \nWe solicit comment on whether we \nshould also require the UM committee to ensure that the UM policies and procedures are developed in consultation with contracted providers; whether the UM committee should \nensure, as required by \u00a7 422.202(b)(2), that MA organization communicates information about practice guidelines and UM policies to providers and, when appropriate, to enrollees; and whether the UM committee should have an ongoing or active oversight role in ensuring that decisions made by an MA plan throughout the year are consistent with the final, approved practice guidelines and UM policies. We also propose at \u00a7 422.137(d)(3) that the committee must revise UM policies and procedures as necessary, and at least annually, to comply with the standards in the regulation, including removing requirements for UM for services and items that no longer warrant UM so that UM policies and procedures remain in compliance with current clinical guidelines. Mandating annual review of utilization management policies using these standards will help ensure that medically necessary services are accessible to all enrollees. Because prior authorization and referral or gatekeeper policies are included in UM policies and procedures, these proposed requirements would apply as well to those polices used by MA organizations. CMS expects MA organizations to update their UM policies after the UM committee approves or revises them. We solicit comment as well on the extent to which the proposed regulation text sufficiently and clearly establishes the standards and requirements discussed here. \nWe are considering whether the \nduties of this UM Committee should be expanded to include all internal coverage policies of an MA plan (or at least of all coordinated care plans). Whether a policy is explicitly called \u2018\u2018utilization management\u2019\u2019 or a \u2018\u2018coverage criteria,\u2019\u2019 the policy can limit enrollee access to plan-covered services.

Utilization Management Committee \nMembership \nAt \u00a7 422.137(c)(1) through (4), we \npropose that the UM committee must include a majority of members who are practicing physicians; include at least one practicing physician who is independent and free of conflict relative to the MA organization and MA plan; include at least one practicing physician who is an expert regarding care of elderly or disabled individuals; and include members representing various clinical specialties (for example, \nprimary care, behavioral health) to ensure that a wide range conditions are adequately considered in the development of the MA plan\u2019s utilization management policies.

We have received feedback from the provider community that UM policies for specific services or items are often not reviewed by providers with the expertise appropriate for the service. Therefore, we also solicit comment on whether we should include a requirement, that when the proposed UM committee reviews UM policies applicable to an item or service, that the review must be conducted with the participation of at least one UM committee member who has expertise in \nthe use or medical need for that specific item or service. \nc. Documentation of Determination \nProcess \nWe propose at \u00a7 422.137(d)(4) that the \nUM committee must clearly articulate and document processes to determine that the requirements under paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section have been met, including the determination by an objective party of whether disclosed financial interests are conflicts of interest and the management of any recusals due to such conflicts. Finally, we propose at \u00a7 422.137(d)(5) that the UM committee must document in writing the reason for its decisions regarding the development of UM policies and make this documentation available to CMS upon request. The documentation should provide CMS with an understanding of the UM committee\u2019s rationale for their decision, and may include, but is not limited to, information such as meeting minutes outlining issues discussed and any relevant supporting documentation. \nd.

We believe that similar requirements, which were modeled after the longstanding Part D P&T committee requirements at \u00a7 423.120(b), are generally adequate for the purposes of the UM committee. Overall, this proposal is designed to require review and approval of utilization management policies, including utilization management policies that use or impose coverage criteria, to ensure that these policies and procedures are medically appropriate, consistent with Medicare coverage rules, and do not negatively impact access to medically necessary services. \nTo meet the existing requirements at \n\u00a7 422.136(b), MA\u2013PDs are permitted to utilize an existing P&T committee established for purposes of administration of the Part D benefit under part 423 of this chapter. Thus, we anticipate that some of the requirements proposed for the UM committee may overlap or duplicate existing P&T committee requirements in connection with coverage of and utilization management policies for Part B drugs. Therefore, we solicit comment on whether an MA plan should be permitted to utilize the proposed UM committee at \u00a7 422.137 to also meet the existing P&T committee requirements of \u00a7 422.136(b), provided that elements and requirements of all applicable regulations governing the committees and their functions (that is, \u00a7\u00a7 422.136, proposed 422.137, and 423.120) are met. To the extent that LCD policies and localized or regional professional standards of practice are used by the proposed UM committee in performing its duties, it may not be advisable to permit use of one UM committee to serve multiple functions for diverse service areas. We also solicit comment on whether to explicitly permit an MA organization, or the parent organization of one or more MA organizations, to use one UM committee to serve multiple MA plans, including whether that should be limited to MA plans that are offered under the same contract. \n6. Additional Areas for Consideration \nand Comment \na. Termination of Services in Post-Acute \nCare \nWe have received complaints about \npotential quality of care issues regarding early termination of services in post- acute care settings by MA organizations. The complaints allege that MA \norganizations are increasingly terminating beneficiaries\u2019 coverage of post-acute care before the beneficiaries are healthy enough to return home. It is further alleged that, in some situations, even after a beneficiary has successfully appealed to the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) and received a favorable decision to reauthorize coverage of services delivered by providers of services described in \u00a7\u00a7 422.624 and 422.626, the MA organization sends another notice of termination of services a day or two after the coverage was reinstated. As described in section III.E.2. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to revoke the current policy, outlined in the June 2000 final rule, that when a health care service can be Medicare- covered and delivered in more than one way, or by more than one type of practitioner, an MA plan could choose how the covered services will be provided. Under the proposal at \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i), when care can be delivered in more than one way or in more than one type of setting, and a contracted provider has ordered or requested Medicare covered items or services for an MA enrollee, the MA organization may only deny coverage of the services or setting on the basis of the ordered services failing to meet the criteria outlined in \u00a7 422.101(c)(1)(i) While CMS believes this may address some of the issues regarding early termination of services, we are soliciting feedback from stakeholders that have information related to this situation, and investigating internally, in order to get a more thorough understanding on the issue. \nThe rules at 42 \u00a7 422.624 define what \nconstitutes a termination of services from home health agencies, SNFs, and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities and how enrollees must be notified of upcoming terminations of services. We solicit comment on potential changes we could make to existing rules, including \u00a7 422.624, or in adopting new rules to better manage incentives between MA organizations and post-acute care providers to deliver the best possible care for Medicare beneficiaries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5a33074-5fe5-4aed-a928-434cb4ade067": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5a33074-5fe5-4aed-a928-434cb4ade067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6d58196-f211-4c58-a45c-c081ba428791", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c993ad8f2fb5a0f86dd77ec1a2d96d6cd00944d409dd2294455ad9a333b3ab46"}, "2": {"node_id": "478d9172-6719-4107-a004-ec3cac81e69d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "19ed6cfa361666c21d71b9f6882abd86b649fc727c08cf79e7f0542451bdf303"}}, "hash": "16b861c66f74f35fc5cba0d9dee7c98e77270a61a14bd4e2191d1ecc86b6624d", "text": "Some topics for comment \ninclude: \n\u2022How MA organizations \npreauthorize treatment in discrete increments and the extent to which our proposals (at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.101(b) and (c) and 422.112(b)(8)) may address or limit these practices; \n\u2022Whether enrollees should have \nadditional time to file appeals or be able to file late appeals to the QIO regarding terminations of services; \u2022Whether enrollees should receive \ninformation from the MA plan regarding \nthe basis for termination of services (for example, the clinical rationale for termination of services) as part of the termination notice and without the enrollee having to request an appeal to the QIO (see \u00a7 422.626(e)(1) and (2)); \n\u2022When coverage is reinstated based \non a QIO decision, whether the enrollee should have more than the 2 day period from the date of a new termination of services notice before coverage can be terminated again by the MA organization, taking into account any medical necessity determinations made by the QIO. \nWe thank commenters in advance for \ncarefully considering and providing information on this important issue. \nb. Gold Carding \nIn the 2020 proposed rule titled \n\u2018\u2018Medicaid Program; Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act; Reducing Provider and Patient Burden by Improving Prior Authorization Processes, and Promoting Patients\u2019 Electronic Access to Health Information for Medicaid Managed Care Plans, State Medicaid Agencies, CHIP Agencies and CHIP Managed Care Entities, and Issuers of Qualified Health Plans on the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges; Health Information Technology Standards and Implementation Specifications,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on December 18, 2020 (85 FR 82586), (hereinafter the December 2020 proposed rule), CMS requested comments on \u2018\u2018gold-carding,\u2019\u2019 MA plan programs that relax or reduce prior authorization requirements for contracted providers that have demonstrated a consistent pattern of compliance with plan policies and procedures. At 85 FR 82619, CMS noted that some MA plans relieve certain contracted providers from prior authorizations requirements based on consistent adherence to plan requirements, appropriate utilization of items or services, and other evidence- driven criteria that the MA plan deems relevant. In the December 2020 proposed rule, CMS also discussed its own experience and success with a similar approach in the Medicare FFS Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services.\n88It is appropriate to \nreiterate in this rule that we believe the use of gold-carding programs could help alleviate the burden associated with prior authorization and that such \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0698d3a7-b521-41d1-9fb2-c45f4f5437d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0698d3a7-b521-41d1-9fb2-c45f4f5437d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f41f9a53-b49a-4fce-9fdf-73f27dfcb33c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9ea02925843f5e36b5fad59949f84e604dce9c344cb00c9f19ac9be35654f7e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd53e93e-d743-4457-a7a5-500a2ba27798", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "521995245ce6d85460412f48d6cf6f0d832b94bab49870325b3b3ef5522917b2"}}, "hash": "dcc9c14a556e6728f343c1b25e3b3e9c016c4ae38677bef117961e113238837b", "text": "79508 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nprograms could facilitate more efficient \nand timely delivery of health care services to enrollees. We encourage MA plans to adopt gold-carding programs that would allow providers to be exempt from prior authorization and provide more streamlined medical necessity review processes for providers who have demonstrated compliance with plan requirements. \nc. Address Vulnerabilities That Can \nLead to Manual Review Errors and System Errors \nFinally, the April 2022 OIG report \nindicated that some denials were the result of MA plan errors. This included both human and system related errors. For example, the OIG found situations where a request was denied because the MA plan reviewer misidentified important information in a request. They also found situations where a request was denied because provider coverage details were incorrectly configurated in the MA plan\u2019s system. As a result of these findings, the OIG recommends that CMS should direct MA organizations to take additional steps to identify and address vulnerabilities that can lead to manual review errors and system errors. We concurred with this recommendation, and are directing MA plans to review PA procedures, protocols, and systems to identify and address vulnerabilities that can lead to errors. Currently, \u00a7 422.503(b)(4) requires all MA organizations to have administrative and management arrangements that include an effective compliance program, which must include measures that prevent, detect, and correct non- compliance with CMS\u2019 program requirements as well as measures that prevent, detect, and correct fraud, waste, and abuse; MA organizations are required to include in this compliance program the establishment and implementation of an effective system for routine monitoring and identification of compliance risks. Failure to furnish medically necessary covered services in a timely manner implicates compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 422.100, 422.101 and 422.112 at a minimum, and \nwe believe that the OIG\u2019s April 2022 report has sufficiently identified this area as a compliance risk that MA organizations must address in accordance with \u00a7 422.503(b)(4)(vi)(F) and (G). \nWe solicit comment on whether and \nhow existing requirements at \u00a7 422.503(b)(4)(vi) may be adjusted to better account for these medical review and system errors. In addition, we solicit comment whether proposed \u00a7 422.137 should include a provision for the UM committee to develop, \nimplement and oversee activities by MA organizations related to utilization policies and procedures. \nF. Request for Comment on the Rewards \nand Incentives Program Regulations for Part C Enrollees (\u00a7 422.134 and Subpart V) \nCMS is soliciting comment on a \npotential revision to the regulation governing MA Reward and Incentive (R&I) programs. CMS first authorized MA organizations to offer R&I programs in a regulation (\u00a7 422.134) finalized in 2014 (79 FR 29956, published May 23, 2014) and subsequently updated that regulation in a January 2021 final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly\u2019\u2019 (85 FR 5864, January 21, 2021). \nCMS\u2019s intent in adopting \u00a7 422.134 to \nauthorize MA R&I programs to be offered by MA organizations is to incentivize healthy behaviors among enrollees. Under \u00a7 422.134, MA plans have the option to uniformly offer enrollees rewards in exchange for participating in health related activities which either promote improved health, prevent injury and illness, or promote efficient use of health care resources. Our experience has shown that these programs have been successful to date. \nIn adopting the regulation governing \nMA R&I programs, we relied on our \nauthority under sections 1856(b)(1) and 1857(e)(1) of the Act. In addition, several of the provisions of the regulation, such as compliance with relevant fraud and abuse laws including the Federal anti-kickback statute and compliance with MA program anti- discrimination provisions, are consistent with laws governing the Medicare program and the MA program as whole. \nSections 1851(h)(4) and 1854(d)(1) of \nthe Act prohibit an MA organization from giving enrollees cash or monetary rebates as an inducement for enrollment or otherwise.

CMS finalized \u00a7 422.134(d)(3)(ii) in a January 2021 final rule with a provision that it is permissible for an MA organization\u2019s R&I program to offer a gift card \u2018\u2018that can be redeemed only at specific retailers or retail chains or for a specific category of items or services.\u2019\u2019 \nHowever, we have been prompted by \nseveral considerations suggesting that CMS may need to further revise and clarify the definition of \u2018\u2018cash equivalent\u2019\u2019 in the framework of MA R&I programs. First, in a recent rule (85 FR 77684, December 2, 2020), OIG explained that cash equivalents include \u2018\u2018gift cards offered by large retailers or online vendors that sell a wide variety of items (for example, big-box stores) . . .\u2019\u2019. Additionally, the January 2021 CMS final rule also finalized authority for a separate R&I program in connection with a Part D real time benefit tool requirement at \u00a7 423.128(d)(4) and (5). In the preamble of that regulation, CMS was clear that a gift card would be considered a cash equivalent when it could be used for large retailers like Amazon. \nIn addition, another CMS rule \n(entitled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Medicare Shared Savings Program; Accountable Care Organizations\u2014Pathways to Success and Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policies for Performance Year 2017\u2019\u2019 published on December 31, 2018 (83 FR 67816, 67980)) characterizes Amazon gift cards \nas cash equivalents because they could be used for a variety of diverse purchases, which makes the gift card usable like cash (86 FR 5954). \nFinally, in our January 2021 final rule \nadopting \u00a7 422.134, we did not specifically address gift cards from big- box stores nor did we discuss them in relation to the prohibition on cash equivalents in \u00a7 422.134(d)(2)(i). CMS has since received inquiries from various stakeholders requesting a definition of \u2018big-box store\u2019 in the context of MA R&I program gift cards. \nBecause of these considerations and \nto clarify the scope of prohibited cash equivalents for the purposes of MA Reward & Incentive programs, we are \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edbc1ef5-c4d5-447a-bce7-02b6c71ae478": {"__data__": {"id_": "edbc1ef5-c4d5-447a-bce7-02b6c71ae478", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6addf601-4999-4d49-82cf-82889d2bb565", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9e4508e93cbbfbc62c5a99a9fa96872522caa940ddd32971823c2e15d8698f27"}, "3": {"node_id": "fea7fded-167a-4698-befe-5256022f716b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "528977eefc8e25a42198aacf9e96ffffe9a0a6a592cd21555784c4aaa5133402"}}, "hash": "d775816934a7ebaa08ca57ee4c642e6ed65dd939008d177ed253e15a09e7387f", "text": "79509 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n89See interim final rule with request for \ncomments titled \u2018\u2018Additional Policy and Regulatory \nRevisions in Response to the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency\u2019\u2019 CMS 9912 IFC, 85 FR 71142. soliciting comment on whether CMS \nshould further clarify the definition of \u2018\u2018cash equivalent\u2019\u2019 as that term is used in \u00a7 422.134.

We welcome feedback on all aspects of this issue. \nG. Section 1876 Cost Contract Plans and \nCost-Sharing for the COVID\u201319 Vaccine and its Administration (\u00a7 417.454) \nSection 3713 of The Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (2020) (Pub. L. 116\u2013136) requires coverage of the COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration at zero cost-sharing for enrollees of Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. The CARES Act revised section 1861(s)(10)(A) of the Act to include among services provided at zero cost-sharing in the Medicare FFS program, the COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration. As amended by section 3713 of the CARES Act, section 1852(a)(1)(B)(iv)(VI) of the Act prohibits MA plans from using cost-sharing that exceeds the cost-sharing imposed under traditional Medicare for a COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration when the MA plan covers this Traditional Medicare benefit. \nCost plans are coordinated care plans \nand share many of the same features as Medicare Advantage plans but have a separate statutory authority (section 1876 of the Act) and are paid on a reasonable cost basis, In addition, unlike with MA plans, enrollees in cost plans may receive services from original Medicare in addition to services from the cost plan\u2019s network; when they receive benefits from healthcare providers that are not contracted with the cost plan, cost plan enrollees are covered by original Medicare, with the same cost sharing and coverage as the Traditional Medicare program. The CARES Act did not include the zero \ncost-sharing provision for section 1876 cost contract plans (cost plans), so using its authority under section 1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act, which authorizes CMS to impose \u2018\u2018other terms and conditions not inconsistent with [section 1876]\u2019\u2019 that are deemed \u2018\u2018necessary and appropriate,\u2019\u2019 CMS established a requirement for cost plans to use cost sharing that does not exceed the cost sharing in Traditional Medicare for a COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration in an interim final rule, \ntitled Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency, which appeared in the Federal Register on November 6, 2020.\n89Because of the cost \nsharing used in Traditional Medicare per sections 1833(a)(1)(B) and \n1861(s)(10)(A) of the Act, this is effectively a requirement to cover this benefit with zero cost sharing. In a newly adopted \u00a7 417.454(e)(4), we specified the timeline for coverage of a COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration with zero cost-sharing for cost plans coverage of cost-sharing for cost plans that may not exceed cost sharing under Traditional Medicare as the \u2018\u2018duration of the PHE for the COVID\u201319 pandemic, specifically the end of the emergency period defined in paragraph (1)(B) of section 1135(g) of the Act, which is the PHE declared by the Secretary on January 31, 2020 and any renewals thereof.\u2019\u2019 However, the CARES Act did not specify an end date for the zero cost-sharing requirement for MA plans and we believe that it is appropriate that enrollees in a section 1876 cost plan have the cost sharing protection for a COVID vaccine and its administration enrollees in the Medicare FFS program and in MA plans have when these cost plan enrollees get this benefit from healthcare providers that are in-network with the cost plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fea7fded-167a-4698-befe-5256022f716b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fea7fded-167a-4698-befe-5256022f716b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6addf601-4999-4d49-82cf-82889d2bb565", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9e4508e93cbbfbc62c5a99a9fa96872522caa940ddd32971823c2e15d8698f27"}, "2": {"node_id": "edbc1ef5-c4d5-447a-bce7-02b6c71ae478", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d775816934a7ebaa08ca57ee4c642e6ed65dd939008d177ed253e15a09e7387f"}}, "hash": "528977eefc8e25a42198aacf9e96ffffe9a0a6a592cd21555784c4aaa5133402", "text": "Therefore, we are proposing to replace the provision adopted at \u00a7 417.454(e)(4) in the November 2020 interim final rule with a new requirement that section 1876 cost plans cover without cost- sharing the COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration described in section 1861(s)(10)(A) of the Act. This proposal is based on authority in section 1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act to add requirements for cost plans. \nCMS believes that it is necessary and \nappropriate to ensure that cost plan enrollees, like other Medicare beneficiaries, are provided access to the COVID\u201319 vaccine and its administration without cost-sharing in- network. Requiring cost plans to comply with the same cost-sharing protections available to Medicare beneficiaries in traditional Medicare and those enrolled in MA plans would ensure equitable access to care and that cost is not a barrier for beneficiaries to receive the COVID\u201319 vaccine. CMS has extended to cost plans other statutory requirements related to cost-sharing via regulation for those services that the Secretary determines require a level of \npredictability and transparency for beneficiaries. For example, in a final rule which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2011, CMS, using \nits authority under section 1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act, extended to cost plans the statutory requirements specifying that in-network cost-sharing for MA enrollees could not be higher than cost- sharing for traditional Medicare enrollees for chemotherapy administration services, renal dialysis services, and skilled nursing care in those cost sharing protections are \u00a7 417.454(e)(1) through (e)(3).

Review of Medical Necessity \nDecisions by a Physician or Other Health Care Professional With Expertise in the Field of Medicine Appropriate to the Requested Service and Technical Correction to Effectuation Requirements for Standard Payment Reconsiderations (\u00a7\u00a7 422.566, 422.590, and 422.629) \nBased on general feedback CMS has \nreceived from provider associations regarding the use of prior authorization (PA) by MA organizations and the submission and review of clinical documentation to support a request for coverage of a service subject to PA, we are proposing to modify the requirement in \u00a7\u00a7 422.566(d) and 422.629(k)(3) with respect to the expertise of the physician or other appropriate health care professional who must review an organization determination if the MA organization or applicable integrated plan (AIP), defined at \u00a7 422.561, expects to issue an adverse decision based on the initial review of the request. Pursuant to our authority under section 1856(b) of the Act to adopt standards to carry out the Part C program and in order to implement section 1852(g) of the Act regarding coverage decisions and appeals, CMS established procedures and minimum standards for MA plans to make organization determinations and reconsiderations regarding benefits. In addition, CMS adopted unified grievance and appeal procedures using authority in section 1859(f)(8)(B) of the Act to establish such unified procedures for D\u2013SNPs; we limited the unified procedures to AIPs, a subset of D\u2013SNPs, when adopting those procedures. These requirements are codified in our regulations at 42 CFR part 422, subpart M. In addition, because cost plans must comply with the beneficiary appeals and grievance \nrights, procedures, and requirements at Part 422, subpart M, per \u00a7\u00a7 417.600(b) and 417.840, these proposals apply to cost plan and healthcare prepayment plan appeals as well. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3124d277-adbd-43e6-bf47-b793f073deee": {"__data__": {"id_": "3124d277-adbd-43e6-bf47-b793f073deee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "532e6ff3-8855-4552-919c-55667a91a8cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e337bfe3ef031f25d90f6172a1d6ab9d1d5a1f7fb92cbca2b2977b8e76716307"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8317fa6-2991-4073-a0d5-4f6fc6a746a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "62c6f8ffc773711f0d8233e6a518c4799972b75d0b85ec30afdc741c33e189ad"}}, "hash": "9ccf5ef5de1733e3179d38d1e453e25ea50f536fa861d8a0f6c11016a0919791", "text": "79510 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nSpecifically, section 1852(g)(1)(A) of \nthe Act requires that a MA organization \nhave a procedure for making determinations regarding whether an enrollee is entitled to receive a health service and the amount (if any) the individual is required to pay for such service and, further, that such procedures provide that determinations be made on a timely basis, subject to section 1852(g)(3) of the Act (which provides for expedited determinations and reconsiderations as part of the MA plan\u2019s appeal process). Section 1852(g)(2)(B) of the Act requires plan reconsiderations related to coverage denials that are based on medical necessity determinations to be made by a physician with appropriate expertise in the applicable field of medicine, and that the physician reviewer be different from the physician or other health care professional involved in the initial determination. While section 1852(g)(1)(A) of the Act does not specify who must conduct the initial medical necessity determinations, we interpret the reference in section 1852(g)(2)(B) of the Act to the physician involved in the initial determination to mean that MA plans must have appropriate health care professionals review initial determinations involving issues of medical necessity. This is an established interpretation of the statute and is reflected in existing regulations related to review of organization determinations. Specifically, the current regulation at \u00a7 422.566(d) states that if the MA organization expects to issue a partially or fully adverse medical necessity (or any substantively equivalent term used to describe the concept of medical necessity) decision based on the initial review of the request, the organization determination must be reviewed by a physician or other appropriate health care professional with sufficient medical and other expertise, including knowledge of Medicare coverage criteria, before the MA organization issues the organization determination decision. The physician or other health care professional must have a current and unrestricted license to practice within the scope of his or her profession in a State, Territory, Commonwealth of the United States (that is, Puerto Rico), or the District of Columbia. The current regulation at \u00a7 422.629(k)(3) also applies the same requirement to AIPs with the additional requirement that the health care professional also have knowledge of Medicaid coverage criteria. \nWe are proposing to revise \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.566(d) and 422.629(k)(3) to add to that existing requirement that the physician or other appropriate health care professional who conducts the review must have expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the item or service being requested before the MA organization or AIP issues an adverse organization determination decision. In other words, we are proposing that the existing regulation text with the more general requirement that the physician or other appropriate health care professional have sufficient medical and other expertise be replaced by a requirement linking the requisite expertise of the reviewer to the specific service that is the subject of the organization determination request. Under this proposal, the physician or other appropriate health care professional reviewing the request need not, in all cases, be of the same specialty or subspecialty as the treating physician or other health care provider. This is the same standard set forth at \u00a7 422.590(h)(2) related to the appropriate expertise applicable to physician review of reconsiderations. The rule at \u00a7 422.590(h)(2) interprets and implements the requirement in section 1852(g)(2)(B) of the Act that any reconsideration that relates to a determination to deny coverage based on a lack of medical necessity be made only by \u2018\u2018a physician with appropriate expertise in the field of medicine which necessitates treatment\u2019\u2019 to mean a physician with an expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the covered services at issue. The standard of requiring a reviewing physician\u2019s expertise to be appropriate for the specific service at issue is long-standing policy with respect to plan reconsiderations and we believe it is appropriate as well as practical to adopt this standard for the review of organization determinations by physicians and other appropriate health professionals in \u00a7\u00a7 422.566(d) and 422.629(k)(3). Specifically, this proposed approach would strengthen clinical review in the organization determination process, while continuing to afford plans maximum flexibility in leveraging reviewer resources. \nIf this proposal is finalized, we expect \nMA organizations, including AIPs, to apply the standard of \u2018\u2018expertise appropriate for the specific service at issue\u2019\u2019 at the organization determination level in the same manner as plans have applied this standard at the reconsideration level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8317fa6-2991-4073-a0d5-4f6fc6a746a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8317fa6-2991-4073-a0d5-4f6fc6a746a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "532e6ff3-8855-4552-919c-55667a91a8cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e337bfe3ef031f25d90f6172a1d6ab9d1d5a1f7fb92cbca2b2977b8e76716307"}, "2": {"node_id": "3124d277-adbd-43e6-bf47-b793f073deee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9ccf5ef5de1733e3179d38d1e453e25ea50f536fa861d8a0f6c11016a0919791"}}, "hash": "62c6f8ffc773711f0d8233e6a518c4799972b75d0b85ec30afdc741c33e189ad", "text": "As explained in the final rule establishing the Medicare+Choice program (65 FR 40170, 40288), published June 29, 2000, which later became the Medicare Advantage program, and in established sub-regulatory guidance, if the physician is not of the same specialty or subspecialty as the treating physician, the physician must have the appropriate level of training and expertise to evaluate the necessity of the requested drug, item, or service. This does not require the physician involved to be of the exact same specialty or sub-specialty as the treating physician. As an example, where there are few practitioners in a highly specialized field of medicine, a plan may not be able to retain the services of a physician of the same specialty or sub-specialty to review the organization determination. Plans will have discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis what constitutes appropriate expertise based on the services being requested and relevant aspects of the enrollee\u2019s health condition. For example, if an enrollee is referred by a primary care physician to a thyroid surgeon for a thyroid nodule removal, the health professional evaluating the request prior to the plan issuing a denial should be a doctor with thyroid expertise, but does not necessarily need to be a surgeon. As another example, if a plan intends to deny a request for a home nebulizer, the organization determination request should be reviewed by a health professional with respiratory expertise, such as a respiratory therapist. \nIf finalized, we believe this proposal \nwill enhance the existing requirement for who is permitted to review organization determinations that deny coverage in whole or in part, while retaining plan flexibility and operational efficiency in selecting appropriate reviewers. We reiterate that this requirement applies when the MA organization or AIP expects to issue a partially or fully adverse medical necessity decision based on the initial review of the request and does not limit the scope of reviewers where the plan approves coverage or determines that an item or service is medically necessary. From the perspective of enrollees and providers who request coverage on an enrollee\u2019s behalf or submit clinical documentation to support a coverage request, we believe this review standard will increase the likelihood of a thorough clinical review. Requiring expertise related to the requested service, as we are proposing, will enhance the overall decision-making process and the quality of the review conducted at the organization determination level, particularly when a prior authorization or other utilization management requirement on the requested item or service necessitates review of specific clinical \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9523f80-a654-49fc-ab54-e744e24c604e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9523f80-a654-49fc-ab54-e744e24c604e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "082a2dc2-7976-4d8f-8f84-f4decfe44b8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "043b53c604475b22683f8b4b839d6dc74929e369c3fddbdd17852ed9b213930f"}, "3": {"node_id": "53478ac3-cf93-4d08-a0c8-44684a35e4e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2abb4539346fcc1ab074efd9be9a26d1b3a55f8bd253738bdd2d7d3521998dc4"}}, "hash": "19a2f6d479767073c33bc611e377f07f634670337b81af579c83d754b94a4f38", "text": "79511 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n90https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- \nGuidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/ \nmc86c12.pdf. documentation to support coverage. \nFurther, we believe this proposal may reduce coverage denials at the organization determination level that could then be subject to the administrative appeals process. As a whole, we believe that this proposal strikes the appropriate balance between the proper clinical review of organization determinations and minimizing overall burden in the administration of the Part C benefit for MA plans and AIPs. \nWhile the proposed requirement that \nthe physician or other appropriate health care professional have expertise in the field appropriate to the requested service may result in AIPs and other MA organizations reallocating staff resources in certain cases to ensure that someone with appropriate expertise is reviewing the request, we believe that the burden will be negligible and that this proposal will not require changes to AIPs and other MA organizations overall staffing. While performing a review of an organization determination request involves review of clinical documentation, this proposal would not impose any new information collection or recordkeeping requirements on AIPs or other MA organizations. \nIn the course of this rulemaking, we \nnoticed the need for a technical correction in \u00a7 422.590(b)(1), which cross references the effectuation requirements in \u00a7 422.618. Section 422.590(b)(1) erroneously cites to \u00a7 422.618(a)(1), but it should cite to the effectuation requirements at \u00a7 422.618(a)(2) related to favorable decisions on payment requests. Thus, we propose to make the technical correction in this rule. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal and the technical correction. \nI. Effect of Change of Ownership \nWithout Novation Agreement (\u00a7\u00a7 422.550 and 423.551) \nIn accordance with standards under \nsections 1857 and 1860 of the Act, each Medicare Advantage (MA) organization and Part D sponsor is required to have a contract with CMS in order to offer an MA or prescription drug plan. Further, section 1857(e)(1) and 1860D\u2013 12(b)(3)(D) of the Act authorizes additional contract terms consistent with the statute and which the Secretary finds are necessary and appropriate. Pursuant to this authority and at the outset of the Part C and Part D programs, we implemented contracting regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.550 and 423.551, respectively, which provide for the novation of an MA or Part D contract in the event of a change of ownership involving an MA organization or Part D sponsor (63 FR \n35106 and 70 FR 4561). \nOur current regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.550 \nand 423.551, as well as our MA guidance under \u2018\u2018Chapter 12 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual\u2014Effect of Change of Ownership\u2019\u2019\n90require that \nwhen a change of ownership occurs, as defined in the regulation, advance notice must be provided to CMS and the parties to the transaction must enter into a written novation agreement that meets CMS\u2019 requirements. If a change of \nownership occurs and a novation agreement is not completed and the entities fail to provide notification to CMS, the regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.550(d) and 423.551(e) indicate that the existing contract is invalid. Furthermore, \u00a7\u00a7 422.550(d) and 423.551(e) provide that if the contract is not transferred to the new owner through the novation process, the new owner must enter into a new contract with CMS after submission of an MA or Part D application, if needed. \nThe current regulation does not fully \naddress what happens when the contract becomes \u2018\u2018invalid\u2019\u2019 due to a change of ownership without a novation agreement and/or notice to CMS, or in other words, what happens to the existing CMS contract that was held by an entity that was sold. This presents an issue because CMS would still recognize the original entity as the owner, even if the contract is now held by a different entity. Therefore, we are proposing to revise \u00a7\u00a7 422.550(d)(1) and 423.551(e)(1) to make it clear that in this case, the affected contract may be unilaterally terminated by CMS in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 422.510(a)(4)(ix) and 423.509(a)(4)(ix), which establishes that failure to comply with the regulatory requirements contained in part 422 (or part 423 if applicable) is a basis for CMS to terminate an MA or Part D contract.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53478ac3-cf93-4d08-a0c8-44684a35e4e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "53478ac3-cf93-4d08-a0c8-44684a35e4e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "082a2dc2-7976-4d8f-8f84-f4decfe44b8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "043b53c604475b22683f8b4b839d6dc74929e369c3fddbdd17852ed9b213930f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9523f80-a654-49fc-ab54-e744e24c604e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "19a2f6d479767073c33bc611e377f07f634670337b81af579c83d754b94a4f38"}}, "hash": "2abb4539346fcc1ab074efd9be9a26d1b3a55f8bd253738bdd2d7d3521998dc4", "text": "In addition, we are strengthening our enforcement authority regarding this process, with the proposed amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 422.550(d) and 423.551(e). Pursuant to our authority under sections 1857 and 1860 of the Act, we propose to amend the regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.550(d) and 423.551(e) to outline the process CMS will follow, including imposing applicable sanctions before terminating a contract that has a change in ownership without a novation agreement, in accordance with CMS requirements. \nIn the interest of protecting and \neffectively managing the MA and Part D programs, CMS, through the application process, must ensure that MAOs \nthrough their respective legal entities are deemed eligible to contract with CMS. Thus, any change in ownership from one legal entity to another requires CMS to determine whether the new organization continues to meet the regulatory requirements for operating a contract under the MA and Part D programs. If this does not happen and a change in ownership from one legal entity to another occurs without CMS approval, it compromises our ability to ensure the integrity of the MA and Part D programs and further puts at risk our ability to monitor a contract\u2019s activity under the new legal entity, thereby putting enrollees at risk. We propose to provide an opportunity for organizations to demonstrate that the legal entity that is assuming ownership by way of novation is able to meet the requirements set forth by our regulations. \nWe propose to impose intermediate \nenrollment and marketing sanctions, as outlined in \u00a7 422.750(a)(1) and (a)(3) and \u00a7 423.750(a)(1) and (a)(3) on the affected contract, that will remain in place until CMS approves the Change of Ownership, (including execution of an approved novation agreement) or the contract is terminated.

Additionally, as specified in \u00a7\u00a7 422.760(b)(2) and 423.760(b)(2), CMS is permitted to impose CMPs of up to $25,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, for each enrollee directly adversely affected or with a substantial likelihood of being adversely affected by a deficiency. CMS has the authority to issue a CMP up to the maximum amount permitted under regulation, as adjusted annually\n91for each affected \nenrollee or per determination, however CMS does not necessarily apply the maximum penalty amount authorized by the regulation in all instances because the penalty amounts under the current CMP calculation methodology are generally sufficient to encourage compliance with CMS rules. \nOn December 15, 2016, CMS released \non its website, the first public CMP calculation methodology for calculating CMPs for MA organizations and Part D sponsors starting with referrals received in 2017. On March 15, 2019, CMS released for comment a proposed CMP calculation methodology on its website that revised some portions of the methodology released in December 2016. Subsequently, on June 21, 2019, CMS finalized the revised CMP calculation methodology document, made it available on its website, and applied it to CMPs issued starting with referrals received in contract year 2019 and beyond.\n92 \nOn January 19, 2021, CMS published \na final rule in the Federal Register titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly\u2019\u2019 (86 FR 5864).

CMS also tracks the yearly accrual of the penalty amounts and announces them on an annual basis. \nThe intent of the minimum penalty \nincrease policy was to establish the CMP calculation methodology document in regulation to ensure consistency and transparency with CMP penalty amounts. Although parts of the regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.760(b)(3) and 423.760(b)(3) have set standards for CMP penalties, in hindsight, CMS believes that other parts of the regulations unnecessarily complicated CMS\u2019s approach to calculating CMPs, which has the effect of limiting CMS\u2019s ability to protect beneficiaries when CMS determines that an organization\u2019s non-compliance warrants a CMP amount that is higher than would be normally be applied under the CMP methodology. In addition, although CMS always has had the authority to impose up to the maximum authorized under sections 1857(g)(3)(A) and 1860D\u201312(b)(3)(E) of the Act, parts of the minimum penalty increase policy may have inadvertently given the impression that CMS was limiting its ability to take up to the maximum amount permitted in statute and regulation. This was not the intent of the rule. For example, there may be instances where an organization\u2019s non- compliance has so substantially adversely impacted one or more enrollees, that CMS would determine it necessary to impose the maximum CMP amount, or an amount higher than the amount set forth in the CMP methodology guidance to adequately address the non-compliance. In order to clarify its ability to adequately protect beneficiaries and encourage compliance, CMS proposes to modify its rules pertaining to minimum penalty amounts. \nSpecifically, CMS proposes to remove \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.760(b)(3)(i)(E) and 423.760(b)(3)(i)(E), respectively, which is the cost-of-living multiplier. CMS also proposes to remove \u00a7\u00a7 422.760(b)(3)(ii)(A)\u2013(C) and 423.760(b)(3)(ii)(A)\u2013(C), which describes how CMS calculates and applies the minimum penalty amount increase. Lastly, CMS proposes to revise and add new provisions \u00a7\u00a7 422.760(b)(3) and 423.760(b)(3), which explains that CMS will set standard minimum penalty amounts and aggravating factor amounts for per determination and per enrollee penalties in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this paragraph on an annual basis, and restates that CMS has the discretion to issue penalties up to the maximum amount under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) when CMS determines that an organization\u2019s non-compliance warrants a penalty that is higher than would be \napplied under the minimum penalty amounts set by CMS. \nIf finalized, CMS would continue to \nfollow our existing CMP methodology and would only impose up to the maximum CMP amount in instances where we determine non-compliance warrants a higher penalty. This update would also be incorporated in forthcoming revised CMP calculation methodology guidance. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nK.

These laws, enforced by the HHS Office for Civil Rights, include Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18116 and implementing regulation at 45 CFR part 92) (Section 1557), which prohibits, inter alia, discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, and disability in health programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance; and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq. and implementing regulation at 45 CFR part 80) (Title VI), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. Regulations \nimplementing Section 1557 set forth specific requirements related to provision of language assistance services, including requirements for interpreter and translation services, when they are required as a reasonable step to ensure meaningful access to programs or activities by limited English proficient individuals. See 45 CFR part 92 for additional information. organizations and Part D sponsors. CMS \nalso relies on the authority in sections 1852(c)(1) and 1860D\u20134(a)(1)(B) of the Act, under which MA organizations and Part D sponsors must disclose detailed information about plans, to establish call center requirements. These proposed interpreter standards will ensure adequate and appropriate access to information for non-English speaking and Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Medicare beneficiaries, such that the information disclosure requirements for MA organizations and Part D sponsors are met and enrollment in MA and Part D plans is accessible for these groups. \nSpecifically, we propose to require \nMA organizations and Part D sponsors to use interpreters that adhere to generally accepted interpreter ethics principles, including confidentiality; demonstrate proficiency in speaking and understanding at least spoken English and the spoken language in need of interpretation; and interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressively, to and from such language(s) and English, using any necessary specialized vocabulary, terminology, and phraseology. \nCMS has consistently stated that MA \norganizations and Part D sponsors should use appropriate interpreters to ensure that non-English speaking and LEP beneficiaries have access to assistance. On January 2, 2008, CMS released an HPMS memo, \u2018\u2018Best Practices for Addressing the Needs of Non-English Speaking and Limited English Proficient (LEP) Beneficiaries,\u2019\u2019 which suggested that Part D sponsors and MA organizations review additional HHS guidance on developing an effective plan for language assistance for LEP beneficiaries. This guidance, titled \u2018\u2018Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons,\u2019\u2019 appeared in the Federal Register on August 8, 2003 \n(68 FR 47311) and provided the following criteria to determine the competency of interpreters: demonstrate proficiency in and ability to communicate information accurately in both English and in the other language; have knowledge in both languages of any specialized terms or concepts peculiar to the recipient\u2019s program or activity and of any particularized vocabulary and phraseology used by the LEP person; and understand and follow confidentiality and impartiality rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bf9a63d-acf3-4538-a361-52ed5b90d3cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bf9a63d-acf3-4538-a361-52ed5b90d3cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c8e9d3e-1d86-4bf7-9fe2-73954c54ec7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "754c684644a4694086fe0abd1cbc06ae4284924a0a2b032783df03f9c4f05bc5"}, "2": {"node_id": "0178f9bc-52fa-4034-a878-4b19e9a5c77f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "62764db787986d213f65ca9f86cc72113597b9dd96b2bf25869f3471f2bff741"}}, "hash": "3866a2c35e4533474a57bfa4c743cd19bf2167b3ccb0119a3eec211d553a77be", "text": "Additionally, since 2010, CMS has annually encouraged MA organizations \nand Part D sponsors to review and use the Office of Minority Health\u2019s (OMH) National Standards on Culturally and \nLinguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS), originally published in 2001 and most recently updated in 2018.\n94 \nThe CLAS standards include a requirement to provide competent language assistance services. Most recently, in our December 16, 2021 HPMS memo titled \u2018\u20182022 Part C and Part D Call Center Monitoring\u2014 Timeliness and Accuracy & Accessibility Studies,\u2019\u2019 we recommended that MA organizations and Part D sponsors use interpreters that adhere to generally accepted interpreter ethics principles, including confidentiality; demonstrate proficiency in speaking and understanding at least spoken English and the spoken language in need of interpretation; and interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressively, to and from such language(s) and English, using any necessary specialized vocabulary, terminology and phraseology. We selected these criteria in our guidance because they are similar to requirements for interpreters under 45 CFR 92.101(b)(3)(i)(A)\u2013(C), when an interpreter is required as a reasonable step to ensure meaningful access to programs or activities by LEP individuals under 45 CFR 92.101(b)(3)(i), which implements section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. 18116, (Pub. L 111\u2013148).\n95We note that we did not adopt in our guidance, and do not intend to adopt in this proposed rule, the standard for requiring an interpreter under 45 CFR 92.101(b)(1). Rather, we intend to continue to require that Part D sponsors and MA organizations provide an interpreter for non-English speaking and LEP individuals whenever such an individual contacts the toll-free customer call center under 42 CFR 422.111(h)(1)(iii) and 423.128(d)(1)(iii). \nIn the final rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for Contract Year 2012 and Other Changes\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2011 (76 FR 21431), CMS adopted provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iii) and \n423.128(d)(1)(iii) to require MA organizations and Part D sponsors to provide interpreters for non\u2013English speaking and LEP individuals who call the plan\u2019s toll-free customer call center. In the time since CMS created this requirement for MA organizations and Part D sponsors, there has been a significant increase in timely access to interpreters. For example, CMS data show that interpreters were being made available timely by MA and Part D plans during 66 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the calls we monitored in 2011; 82 percent and 81 percent, respectively, in 2015; and 88 percent and 86 percent, respectively, in 2021. \nIn the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on January 19, \n2021 (86 FR 5864) (the January 2021 final rule), CMS codified its standards for evaluating compliance by MA and Part D plans with the requirement to provide interpreters for calls to the plans\u2019 toll-free call centers by amending \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iii) and 423.128(d)(1)(iii). The amendments added requirements that interpreters must be available for 80 percent of incoming calls requiring an interpreter within 8 minutes of reaching the customer service representative and be made available at no cost to the caller. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4de9aa71-70d9-4584-b022-0fdacfdcef34": {"__data__": {"id_": "4de9aa71-70d9-4584-b022-0fdacfdcef34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a03a7a31-d9d9-4011-9506-18667e25130d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8a2ff51ba2cfabc121ebf15ac28cb80f9ad7e85f1fa4a1dedaadae6136589722"}, "3": {"node_id": "e09057f3-6472-41e9-8b96-a8e66307bbef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5a06a33a13abe0eb594a9c2b2eb11e652db0325ee6a31bee343bfcedf811c162"}}, "hash": "e8440ab877f18267d033c2362aac1e1f95d4097da9b22563f2d958969f091366", "text": "79514 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nThese requirements strengthened \nenrollees\u2019 and prospective enrollees\u2019 access to interpreters when they call a plan, and thus to information about how to access Medicare-covered benefits. \nBuilding on our previous regulatory \nproposals to establish and strengthen \nMA and Part D enrollee access to plan interpreter services, we propose to codify requirements for minimum qualifications for interpreters available to non-English speaking and LEP individuals at MA and Part D call centers. To accomplish this, we are proposing to modify \u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iii)(A) to require MA organizations\u2019 interpreters for LEP individuals to meet certain minimum qualifications. As proposed in new paragraphs (A)(1) through (3) these \nqualifications include, respectively: \n\u2022Adhering to generally accepted \ninterpreter ethics principles, including confidentiality; \n\u2022Demonstrating proficiency in \nspeaking and understanding at least spoken English and the spoken language in need of interpretation; and \n\u2022Interpreting effectively, accurately, \nand impartially, both receptively and expressively, to and from such language(s) and English, using any necessary specialized vocabulary, terminology, and phraseology. \nWe propose to establish the same \nrequirements for Part D sponsor interpreters by modifying \u00a7 423.128(d)(1)(iii)(A) and adding proposed new paragraphs (A)(1) through \n(A)(3) that mirror the proposed changes \nto \u00a7 422.111(h). \nWe note that on August 4, 2022, HHS \npublished a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which would codify a definition of qualified interpreter similar to what we are proposing here. \nWe solicit comments on this proposal. \nL. Call Center Teletypewriter (TTY) Services (\u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iv)(B) and 423.128(d)(1)(v)(B)) \nWe are proposing to make a technical \nchange to \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iv)(B) and 423.128(d)(1)(v)(B), which require that MA organizations and Part D sponsors, respectively, connect 80 percent of incoming calls requiring TTY services to a TTY operator within 7 minutes. Our proposed change is intended to remove any ambiguity that might result from our use of the term \u2018\u2018TTY operator.\u2019\u2019 The specific standards found at \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iv)(B) and 423.128(d)(1)(v)(B) were intended to require that that the caller reach a live person and confirm that said person is able to assist with general Medicare questions or questions about the plan\u2019s Part C or Part D benefits within a specific period of time. When an MA organization or Part D sponsor operates their own TTY device and thereby creates a direct TTY to TTY communication, the plan customer representative is also the TTY operator. However, where MA organizations and Part D sponsors utilize telecommunications relay systems, a TTY operator serves as an intermediary between the caller and the plan\u2019s customer service representative and is not able to answer the caller\u2019s questions about plan benefits. \nTo ensure that someone utilizing TTY \nservices is connected to a plan customer representative within 7 minutes, we propose to modify \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(1)(iv)(B) and 423.128(d)(1)(v)(B) to instead require the plan\u2019s call center establish contact with a customer service representative within 7 minutes on no fewer than 80 percent of incoming calls requiring TTY services. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \nM.

We also propose to establish both a lookback period and timeframe to complete overpayments and underpayment notices, as well as a de minimis threshold for such refunds and recoveries. We solicit comments regarding the addition of similar requirements in MA, specifically establishing a lookback period and de minimis threshold for refunding incorrect collections. \n2. Medicare Advantage Prohibition on \nMidyear Benefit Changes (\u00a7 422.254) \nIn our proposed rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Establishment of the Medicare Advantage Program\u2019\u2019 (69 FR 46865), which appeared in the Federal Register on August 3, 2004, and is hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u2018August 2004 MA proposed rule,\u2019\u2019 we acknowledged that in the previous Medicare+Choice program, organizations were permitted to offer MYBEs to existing benefit packages. We proposed to discontinue this policy, noting how we believed that it would no longer be appropriate to allow MA organizations to offer new plans or change an existing plan\u2019s benefits midyear because such revised (or new) MA plans would not reflect the bids which were approved during the normal approval process (as set forth in 42 CFR part 422, subpart K). We explained how MYBEs are de facto adjustments to benefit packages for which bids were submitted by MA organizations based on their estimated revenue requirements. Specifically, we expressed concern that allowing MYBEs could render the bid meaningless (69 FR 46899). \nIn our final rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Establishment of the Medicare Advantage Program\u2019\u2019 (70 FR 4640), which appeared in the Federal Register on January 28, 2005, and is hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u2018January 2005 MA final rule,\u2019\u2019 we adopted the MYBE policy described in the August 2004 MA proposed rule with modifications in response to comments from MA organizations requesting flexibility regarding MYBEs in order to improve \nenrollee experiences or adjust for unforeseen errors, under certain circumstances. Specifically, we adopted a limited MYBE policy to (1) permit a MYBE to be effective no earlier than July 1 of the contract year, and no later than September 1 of the contract year; (2) prohibit MA organizations from submitting MYBE applications later than July 31 of the contract year; and (3) require 25 percent of the value of the MYBE to be retained by the government. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6d62246-243a-49d6-b323-06abad5c1b86": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6d62246-243a-49d6-b323-06abad5c1b86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21bf463d-ec00-4387-ad61-87516fb92226", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bc1b9f1d44ee5947f8ee942408cc4d26c0397692090205f0d89812a968a3a6d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ece5e3b-45fc-4f00-b05f-e2c2a6aab05d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c024866874d61bad4431fe7b15470eac94f8ae15519f50b95cf2123ae33ca805"}}, "hash": "74994851b9cc5a12130a9cb1afc79926a0a103a098467ca56361198cc1c11ef5", "text": "79515 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nThe policy also required the MA \norganization to submit a revised bid and supporting documentation about how revenue requirements were overstated in the bid submitted for the contract year.

However, we are not proposing to prohibit MA plans from revising plan rules, such as prior authorization or referral policies, or from making network changes; the rules in \u00a7 422.111(d) regarding notice to enrollees about changes in plan rules are not proposed to be changed. Please see section III.D. of this proposed rule for our proposal to revise the rules in \u00a7 422.111(e) concerning notice of a change in an MA plan\u2019s provider network. Additionally, this proposal, if finalized, would not prohibit MA plans from covering required changes or additions to basic benefits, that is Part A and Part B benefits that all MA plans must cover, when those changes or additions to basic benefits are the result of a change in the law, such as newly enacted legislation, or rulemaking or a National Coverage Determination; such \nchanges are required to be made by MA plans, subject to section 1852(c)(5) of the Act and \u00a7 422.109 which provide for the Medicare FFS program to cover certain changes in Part A and Part B benefits. Our proposal encompasses other changes in MA non-drug, premiums and any cost sharing outside of required changes or exceptions we have noted here. Consequently, we hereinafter refer to these alterations as \u2018\u2018midyear benefit changes\u2019\u2019 (MYBCs). \nAlthough we finalized the policy in \nthe July 2008 final rule and have accordingly enforced it ever since, we now propose to add regulatory text explicitly prohibiting MYBCs and specifying when such changes will be prohibited. Specifically, we propose to clarify in regulatory text that any changes to non-prescription drug benefits, cost sharing, and premiums are prohibited starting after plans are permitted to begin marketing prospective contract year offerings on October 1 of each year for the following contract year (consistent with \u00a7 422.2263(a)) and through the end of the applicable contract year. This means that after marketing is permitted to begin for the 2024 contract year, MA organizations must offer the benefits described in approved bids through the end of the 2024 contract year. In other words, MA organizations are prohibited in this scenario from changing the benefits, cost sharing and premiums in their approved bids from October 1, 2023 until December 31, 2024, except for modifications in benefits required by law. \nConsistent with our current practice \nas described in the July 2008 final rule, prohibiting changes after marketing is permitted to begin provides MA organizations the flexibility to make changes during the bidding process when permitted by CMS to remain in compliance with the requirements set forth at \u00a7 422.254(b), while also maintaining the integrity of the bidding process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ece5e3b-45fc-4f00-b05f-e2c2a6aab05d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ece5e3b-45fc-4f00-b05f-e2c2a6aab05d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21bf463d-ec00-4387-ad61-87516fb92226", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bc1b9f1d44ee5947f8ee942408cc4d26c0397692090205f0d89812a968a3a6d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6d62246-243a-49d6-b323-06abad5c1b86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "74994851b9cc5a12130a9cb1afc79926a0a103a098467ca56361198cc1c11ef5"}}, "hash": "c024866874d61bad4431fe7b15470eac94f8ae15519f50b95cf2123ae33ca805", "text": "We note that per \u00a7 422.2263 following \nthe start of marketing on October 1 of each year, MA organizations may begin to market and publicize their plan offerings for the following contract year, such that organizations may compare their approved plans against competitors in order to make advantageous changes. As we noted the August 2004 and September 2006 MA proposed rules, allowing MYBCs undermines the integrity of the bidding process as it allows MA organizations to alter their benefit packages after the bidding process is complete. Further, MA organizations may use MYBCs to misrepresent their actual costs and noncompetitively revise their benefit packages later in the year (69 FR 46899, \n70 FR 4301, 71 FR 52016). \nAltering an approved plan to include \nnew benefits after marketing has started may also give MA organizations an unfair advantage over competitors when beneficiaries are selecting their plans during the initial coverage elections period (ICEP). We articulated in the July 2008 final rule that we believe newly age-eligible enrollees are attractive to MA organizations because of their relatively low utilization, as these individuals are new to the program and tend to be healthier (73 FR 43631). Therefore, to prevent MA organizations from inappropriately changing bids to appeal to low-utilization enrollees, an MA organization must provide the benefits described in the MA organization\u2019s final plan benefit package (PBP) (as defined in \u00a7 422.162(a)) until the end of the applicable contract year. The July 2008 final rule reiterated these points. Despite the issuance of the July 2008 final rule, however, we have continued to receive inquiries from MA organizations requesting changes to PBPs after the contract year has begun. \nWe note that MYBCs of this nature \nwould also violate the uniformity requirements set forth at \u00a7 422.100(d)(ii), which requires that an MAO must offer their plan to all beneficiaries in a service area \u2018\u2018at a uniform premium, with uniform benefits and level of cost sharing throughout the plan\u2019s service area, or segment of service area as provided in \u00a7 422.262(c)(2).\u2019\u2019 Altering the non- prescription drug benefits, premiums, or cost sharing midyear violates this requirement, even if the new benefit, premium, or cost sharing is offered to all of the plan\u2019s enrollees, as some enrollees would have paid for such benefits, premiums, or cost sharing already, and would not be eligible for reimbursement of these costs. In other words, some plan enrollees would have paid higher or lower amounts for the same benefits or services than other enrollees who paid depending on when the MYBC was put in effect. \nOn May 22, 2020, we issued guidance \nin a Health Plan Management System (HPMS) memorandum titled \u2018\u2018Information Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019\u2014COVID\u201319\u2019\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u20182020 COVID\u201319 \nguidance,\u2019\u2019 and available at https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19- updated-guidance-ma-and-part-d-plan- sponsors-may-22-2020.pdf) which specified changes in policy for MA Organizations following the declaration of the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency (PHE).

Specifically, MYBCs would be allowed when such MYBCs are: (1) provided in connection with the COVID\u201319 PHE; (2) beneficial to enrollees; and (3) provided uniformly to all similarly situated enrollees. Additionally, we permitted MA organizations to implement additional or expanded benefits that address issues or medical needs raised by the COVID\u2013 19 PHE, and provided examples like covering meal delivery or medical transportation services to accommodate the efforts to promote social distancing during the COVID\u201319 PHE. We further noted in our January 14, 2022 memo entitled \u2018\u2018Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201319) Permissive Actions Extended in Contract Year 2022\u2019\u2019 that we would exercise our enforcement discretion until the conclusion of the COVID\u201319 PHE. Despite the current COVID\u201319 guidance, MA organizations have continued to request changes to approved plan bids which are not consistent with the parameters specified in such guidance. \nWhile our proposed addition to the \nregulation text is not intended to supersede the 2020 COVID\u201319 guidance (should it remain in effect through the 2024 calendar year), we propose to add regulatory text to solidify longstanding policy to prohibit MYBCs starting after the plan has begun marketing prospective contract year offerings on October 1 of each year for the following contract year and until the end of the applicable contract year as a means to provide clarification for MA organizations and maintain the integrity of the bidding process. As discussed previously, this prohibition includes exceptions for changes in benefits required by applicable law. \nEmployer Group Waiver Plans \n(EGWPs) exclusively enroll the members of the group health plan sponsored by the employer, labor organization (that is, union) or trustees of funds established by one or more employers or labor organizations to furnish benefits to the entity\u2019s employees, former employees, or members or former members of the labor organizations; these plans generally have \u2018\u2018800 series\u2019\u2019 MA contracts with CMS. These EGWPs are not currently subject to this prohibition on MYBCs under existing CMS waivers for EGWPs. However, an MA organization is subject to the prohibition on MYBCs if the MA \norganization offers an MA plan that that enrolls both individual beneficiaries and employer or union group health \nplan members, (that is, a plan open to general enrollment); for those types of plans, the employer or union sponsor may make mid-year changes to offer or change only non-MA benefits that are not part of the MA contract (that is, are not basic benefits or MA supplemental benefits). (See 73 FR 43630 and Chapter \n9, section 20.3, of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, available at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/ Downloads/mc86c09.pdf.) \nBecause this proposal would add \nregulatory text regarding the MYBC policy which has already undergone notice and comment rulemaking, and does not change the scope of that prior non-codified rule, this provision is technical in nature, and there is no paperwork burden. Additionally, this provision will not impact the Medicare Trust Fund. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \n3. Part D Prohibition on Midyear Benefit \nChanges (\u00a7 423.265) \nSection 1860D\u201311(d) of the Act grants \nCMS the authority to review information pertaining to Part D sponsors\u2019 proposed plans and negotiate terms and conditions of the proposed bid and proposed plan with Part D sponsors. Section 1860D\u201311(e) of the Act grants CMS the authority to approve Part D sponsors\u2019 proposed plans. To implement sections 1860D\u201311(d) and (e) of the Act, we proposed regulations at \u00a7 423.272 in our proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Medicare \nPrescription Drug Benefit\u2019\u2019 (69 FR 46631), which appeared in the Federal Register on August 3, 2004 (hereinafter \nreferred to as the \u2018\u2018August 2004 Part D proposed rule\u2019\u2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "299803bd-002a-4e30-b2c6-b8cb7c654533": {"__data__": {"id_": "299803bd-002a-4e30-b2c6-b8cb7c654533", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c28928ae-d452-497f-b0e0-5ef17547740b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "674ad53016341d5fc833179a721a1b7f5f5c28fd0d7d6689c322b626713ec257"}, "2": {"node_id": "802227c4-d8bc-4424-b2b7-4c30fbc233f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c9104d5eae32d801b573df4c27bcba175938975115f4e47cbe3793450b96edea"}}, "hash": "b956bff485c4f5d686279e8bc7548f9fa048342fd9c4c09683d1c265de0b16ea", "text": "We finalized these regulations in our final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit\u2019\u2019 (70 FR 4193), which appeared in the January 28, 2005 issue of the Federal Register (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u2018January 2005 Part D final rule\u2019\u2019). \nIn response to comments to our \nAugust 2004 Part D proposed rule regarding the authority to enter into bid- level negotiation with Part D sponsors, and as was discussed in section III.M.2. of this proposed rule, we stated in our January 2005 Part D final rule that in order to maintain the integrity of the bidding process, we believed it was not appropriate to allow either MA organizations or Part D sponsors to waive premiums or offer midyear benefit enhancements, as they would be de facto adjustments to benefit packages for which bids were submitted earlier in the year. We also stated that these \nadjustments would be de facto acknowledgement that the revenue requirements submitted by the plan were overstated, and further, that allowing premium waivers or midyear benefit enhancements would render the bid meaningless (70 FR 4301). \nAs noted in section III.M.2. of this \nproposed rule, we previously referred to these changes as \u2018\u2018midyear benefit enhancements,\u2019\u2019 or MYBEs, and it stands to reason that midyear benefit changes, whether enhancements or reductions, are equally problematic from the perspective of bid integrity. Therefore, we hereinafter refer to these alterations as \u2018\u2018midyear benefit changes,\u2019\u2019 or MYBCs. \nAdditionally, section 1860D\u2013 \n11(e)(2)(C) of the Act requires that the bid reasonably and equitably reflect the revenue requirements of the expected population for the benefits provided under the plan. Therefore, in addition to indicating that the plan bid was overstated and rendering the bid meaningless, waiving or reducing the premiums, cost sharing, or both, that are reflected in the approved bid would indicate that the amounts provided in the bid were not necessary for the provision of coverage. \nWe draw a distinction here between \nchanges in \u2018\u2018bid-level\u2019\u2019 cost sharing (for example, the cost sharing associated with an entire tier of drugs) and changes in the cost sharing for an individual drug (for example, when such drug moves from one already approved tier of the benefit to another already approved tier of the benefit). As is discussed further in section III.Q. of this proposed rule, section 1860D\u20134(b)(3)(E) of the Act, as codified at \u00a7 423.120(b)(5),\n96 \nrequires that Part D sponsors provide appropriate notice before any removal of a covered Part D drug from a formulary and \u2018\u2018any change in the preferred or tiered cost-sharing status\u2019\u2019 of such a drug. Thus, the statute contemplates midyear changes in cost sharing of individual formulary drugs. Consequently, since the beginning of the Part D program, we have allowed \nformulary changes that result in changes to the cost sharing for individual drugs (for example, moving a single drug to a different cost-sharing tier), but have declined to permit Part D sponsors to change their benefit designs or waive or reduce premiums, \u2018\u2018bid-level\u2019\u2019 cost sharing (for example, the cost sharing \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "750be95d-926a-43dc-8b54-98a655c6d0d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "750be95d-926a-43dc-8b54-98a655c6d0d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7721161c-3ad7-4c14-b525-5cf5a9bfe388", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "757b566101a483656b67ab15a0c426ddbbd08a48ee9aa9ea3c56c6a824775fe2"}, "3": {"node_id": "0653bc17-e8a4-4b51-8b11-08b211aeddd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7080b338bdadbddee3afa0c5095b068d5185e4e0c7fb5fafbe9dc0ac1bdd1d07"}}, "hash": "73742925864249c9d728884380e1606666a867f8b6e4d3abceb060fc31c5e4e0", "text": "79517 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nassociated with an entire tier of drugs), \nor cost sharing (for some or all enrollees) once plans are permitted to market for the following contract year (on October 1, consistent with \u00a7 423.2263(a)) on the grounds that such activities would be inconsistent with the CMS-approved bid. \nAdditionally, section 1860D\u20132(a) of \nthe Act defines qualified prescription drug coverage to mean standard (Defined Standard or Actuarially Equivalent Standard) prescription drug coverage or alternative prescription drug coverage (with at least actuarially equivalent benefits) and access to negotiated prices in accordance with section 1860D\u20132(d) of the Act. In our proposed rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 (74 FR 54633), which appeared in the October 22, 2009 issue of the Federal Register (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u2018October 2009 proposed rule\u2019\u2019) we further interpreted section 1860D\u20132(a) of the Act as requiring the provision of uniform premium and benefits. We codified these requirements in our regulations at \u00a7 423.104(b) in our final rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 (75 FR 19677), which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2010. \nIn addition to violating the bid \nrequirements, as we noted in the preamble of the October 2009 proposed rule, a Part D sponsor\u2019s waiver of cost sharing midyear also violates the uniform benefit requirements, because doing so results in plans not providing the same coverage to all eligible beneficiaries within their service area (74 FR 54690). The CMS-approved benefit cannot be varied for some or all of the plan\u2019s enrollees midyear, as that would violate the uniform benefit provisions set forth in \u00a7 423.104(b). Even if the plan changes the benefit midyear for all of the plan\u2019s enrollees, this still violates the uniform benefits provision because some of the plan\u2019s enrollees would still have paid for benefits prior to the change. We note that during the COVID\u201319 PHE, CMS provided for specific flexibilities by Part D sponsors to ensure adequate pharmacy access that would otherwise violate the uniform benefit provisions. CMS exercised its enforcement discretion to temporarily permit Part D sponsors to fully or partly waive cost sharing for covered Part D drugs with \nmedically accepted indications for COVID\u201319. To clarify these points for all parties, \nwe propose to codify in regulation our longstanding subregulatory policy at new paragraph \u00a7 423.265(b)(5) which would require that once a Part D sponsor is permitted to market prospective plan year offerings for the following contract year (consistent with \u00a7 423.2263(a)), that is, as of October 1, it shall not change, and therefore, must provide, the benefits described in its CMS-approved plan benefit package (PBP) (as defined at \u00a7 423.182(a)) for the contract year without modification, except where a modification in benefits is required by law. \nAdditionally, we have been \nmonitoring compliance with this policy via our Part D Bid review and approval process, consistent with \u00a7 423.272. Consequently, there is no additional paperwork burden associated with codifying this longstanding subregulatory policy. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \n4. Failure To Collect and Incorrect Collections of Part D Premiums and Cost Sharing Amounts (\u00a7\u00a7 423.293 and 423.294) \nAs was described in section III.M.3. of \nthis proposed rule, Part D sponsors\u2019 waiver of cost sharing or premiums would violate the uniform premium and benefit requirements of section 1860D\u2013 2(a) of the Act and \u00a7 423.104(b). Similarly, Part D sponsors\u2019 incorrect collections of cost sharing and premiums also could have the effect of making the benefit non-uniform. \nThe current regulatory language at \n\u00a7 423.104(b) mirrors the language at \u00a7 422.100(d)(1) and (2)(i) with regard to uniform premiums and cost sharing. However, although the MA program adopted language at \u00a7 422.270 to address incorrect collections of premiums and cost sharing in the January 2005 MA final rule, the regulations in Part 423 do not address Part D sponsor requirements regarding incorrect collections of premiums and cost sharing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0653bc17-e8a4-4b51-8b11-08b211aeddd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0653bc17-e8a4-4b51-8b11-08b211aeddd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7721161c-3ad7-4c14-b525-5cf5a9bfe388", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "757b566101a483656b67ab15a0c426ddbbd08a48ee9aa9ea3c56c6a824775fe2"}, "2": {"node_id": "750be95d-926a-43dc-8b54-98a655c6d0d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "73742925864249c9d728884380e1606666a867f8b6e4d3abceb060fc31c5e4e0"}}, "hash": "7080b338bdadbddee3afa0c5095b068d5185e4e0c7fb5fafbe9dc0ac1bdd1d07", "text": "We intend to bring the Part D requirements into alignment with the existing MA requirements for incorrect collections, as well as establish new requirements regarding failure to collect premiums and cost sharing amounts.

We also propose to codify new requirements regarding failure to collect premiums and cost sharing amounts at \u00a7 423.294. Finally, we solicit comment regarding adding a similar policy to add new requirements for MAOs regarding failure to collect premiums and cost \nsharing in \u00a7 422.270. \nOur proposed Part D requirements \nwould require a Part D sponsor to make a reasonable effort to collect monthly beneficiary premiums under the timing established in \u00a7 422.262(e) (made applicable to Part D premiums in \u00a7 423.293(a)(2)) and ensure collection of cost sharing at the time a drug is dispensed. If for some reason the Part D sponsor fails to collect or ensure collection in a timely manner, the Part D sponsor would be required to make a reasonable effort to bill for and recover the premium or cost sharing amount after the fact. Any adjustments to the premium or cost sharing amount that occur based on subsequently obtained information would be made within the timeframe for coordination of benefits as established at \u00a7 423.466(b), which is 3 years from the date on which the monthly premium was due or on which the prescription for a covered Part D drug was filled. A Part D sponsor could decline to attempt to recover an amount if it is below a de minimis amount, as detailed below. \nOur proposed Part D requirements \nwould also require a Part D sponsor to make a reasonable effort to identify any amounts incorrectly collected from its Medicare enrollees, or from others on behalf of affected enrollees. Sponsors would have to issue refunds during the same 3-year timeline applicable to recoveries, as described previously, and need not issue refunds if they are below a de minimis amount. \nOur proposed Part D requirements \nwould differ from the existing requirements at \u00a7 422.270 in the following ways. The first modification to our proposed requirements for Part D sponsors is that we propose to clarify that the 3-year lookback period established in \u00a7 423.466(b) for coordination of benefits applies to retroactive claim or premium adjustments that result in refunds and recoveries at \u00a7 423.294(b)(2) and (4) and \u00a7 423.294(c)(2), respectively. Currently, a Part D sponsor is required to process retroactive claims adjustments within 45 days of receiving complete information, per \u00a7 423.466(a), and there is no requirement for the timing of retroactive premium adjustments. While \u00a7 423.466(b) allows 3 years for \ncoordination of benefits, there is currently no limit in the regulation for how far back retroactive premium adjustments or claims adjustments unrelated to coordination of benefits must be made. For example, if a Part D sponsor in 2022 identifies an error in their prior years\u2019 drug pricing files that resulted in beneficiaries being charged \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca8124b2-e8cf-4d00-a17a-9fb675a5ad08": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca8124b2-e8cf-4d00-a17a-9fb675a5ad08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00aceda7-5118-4451-bd57-6e52df2f5080", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b9a84777c1e9810359aad150c2cf1daaf6b16ccacf302736f13c95599a1b93e1"}, "3": {"node_id": "2607187a-f5af-4ed1-b194-3f6d84ef3b7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "58980a579ea522bbb6c44c04a8353103c578e1de5007023c1e1b6147dc8c0c64"}}, "hash": "30bc4af0d334143127e83486d02a8dedbcefad89ea6ad181675f530fc1c9fc89", "text": "79518 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nincorrect cost sharing from 2015 to \n2020, the current regulation might require them to refund and/or recover amounts for prescriptions beneficiaries received as long as seven years ago. This is not only inconsistent with our coordination of benefits requirements, which would only require adjustments for the past 3 years, but is potentially confusing to beneficiaries. By proposing to establish a 3-year lookback period in \u00a7 423.294(b)(2) and (4) and \u00a7 423.294(c)(2), we would align the timeframe established in \u00a7 423.466(b) for coordination of benefits with the timeframe for premium adjustments and claims adjustments unrelated to coordination of benefits. Not only would this 3-year period coincide with the timeframe established in \u00a7 423.466(b) for coordination of benefits with State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs) and other entities, including beneficiaries and others paying on the beneficiaries\u2019 behalf, but it would also align with the timeframe for redeterminations in \u00a7 423.1980(b) and (c). A Part D sponsor would not be required to make a premium or claims payment adjustment if more than 3 years has passed from the date of service, just as a Part D sponsor is required to coordinate benefits for a period of 3 years. \nIn section IV.N. of this proposed rule, \nwe are proposing to codify at \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(v) current policy that excepts certain prescription drug plan (PDP) members from being disenrolled for failure to pay plan premiums. Additionally, as also discussed at section IV.N. of this proposed rule, we propose at revised \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(v) a disenrollment exception if the Part D sponsor has been notified that an SPAP, or other payer, is paying the Part D portion of the premium, and the sponsor has not yet coordinated receipt of the premium payments with the SPAP or other payer. We also (1) expect Part D sponsors to issue collection notices and, (2) consistent with the requirements at \u00a7 423.44, require Part D sponsors to make a reasonable attempt at collection, notwithstanding the requirements at \u00a7 423.44 for involuntary disenrollment. Nonetheless, we would not expect a Part D sponsor to disenroll a Part D enrollee for such Part D sponsor\u2019s failure (when the plan made the error) to collect the proper payment and subsequent failure to collect an underpayment. Section 50.3.1 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual also provides that we expect a Part D sponsor to have billed the Part D enrollee prior to the start of the grace period for the actual premium amount due (emphasis added), with such \nnotice/bill specifying the due date for \nthat amount. \nAdditionally, specific to cost sharing, \nunder current regulations at \u00a7 423.566(b)(5), a decision on the amount of cost sharing for a drug constitutes a coverage determination. If a claim adjudicates at an incorrectly low amount, or if other actions by a Part D sponsor result in the Part D enrollee being asked to pay an incorrectly low cost-sharing amount, such adjudication or action is a coverage determination. If the Part D sponsor becomes aware of the error, the Part D sponsor would reopen the previously adjudicated coverage determination consistent with the reopening rules at \u00a7\u00a7 423.1980 through 423.1986. If the Part D sponsor issues an adverse revised determination, the notice must state the rationale and basis for the reopening and revision and any right to appeal. \nSecond, at \u00a7 423.294(b)(2) and (4) and \n\u00a7 423.294(c)(2), respectively, we propose to clarify that the 45-day timeframe in \u00a7 423.466(a) applies to the processing of refunds and recoveries for both claims and premium adjustments. This would make the timeframes for the refund or recovery of premium adjustments the same as for claims adjustments and for refunds and recoveries related to the low-income subsidy program, which under \u00a7 423.800(e) are the same as the requirements of \u00a7 423.466(a). In other words, whenever a Part D sponsor receives, within the 3-year lookback period, information that necessitates a refund of enrollee overpayment of premiums, cost sharing, or both, or recovery of underpayments of premiums, cost sharing, or both, the Part D sponsor would be required to issue refunds or recovery notices within 45 days of the Part D sponsor\u2019s receipt of such information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2607187a-f5af-4ed1-b194-3f6d84ef3b7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2607187a-f5af-4ed1-b194-3f6d84ef3b7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00aceda7-5118-4451-bd57-6e52df2f5080", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b9a84777c1e9810359aad150c2cf1daaf6b16ccacf302736f13c95599a1b93e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca8124b2-e8cf-4d00-a17a-9fb675a5ad08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "30bc4af0d334143127e83486d02a8dedbcefad89ea6ad181675f530fc1c9fc89"}}, "hash": "58980a579ea522bbb6c44c04a8353103c578e1de5007023c1e1b6147dc8c0c64", "text": "Nothing in this proposal would alter the requirements of \u00a7 423.293(a)(4) with respect to the options a Part D sponsor must provide \nPart D enrollees for retroactive collection of premiums. \nWe note we are not proposing any \nchanges to the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 422.2420(c) and 423.2420(c), which provide that uncollected premiums that could have been collected still count as revenue. \nThe final difference between our \nproposed requirements for Part D sponsors and existing Part C requirements is that we propose to apply a de minimis amount, calculated per Prescription Drug Event (PDE) transaction or, for premium adjustments, per month, for these refunds and recoveries. As proposed at \u00a7 423.294(b) and (c)(1), if a refund or recovery amount falls below the de minimis amount set for purposes of \u00a7 423.34(c)(2) for low income subsidies (currently at $2 for 2022), the Part D sponsor would not be required to issue a refund or recovery notice. For instance, if a sponsor in 2024 discovered that it had charged incorrect premiums amounts to certain beneficiaries for a 12-month period from January through December of 2022 and the de minimis amount for 2024 is $2, the sponsor would not have to issue recovery notices to any beneficiary who owed $24 or less total for the 12-month period. This proposal clarifies that the existing coordination of benefits (COB) requirements in \u00a7 423.466 encompass payment adjustments. As such, the proposed timeframe for the proposed requirements to refund or recover incorrectly collected cost sharing and premium amounts would not result in any additional costs to Part D sponsors, Part D enrollees, or the government. Conversely, because there was previously no historical limit or threshold for such refunds and recoveries, establishing both a 3-year lookback period and de minimis amount would remove significant administrative burden on plan sponsors and the government, particularly in circumstances where the amount to be refunded or recovered is less than the postage required to provide a refund or recovery notice. Consequently, this provision would not impact the Medicare Trust Fund, and there would be no additional paperwork burden, as recovery notices are already required under \u00a7 423.466, and \u00a7 423.293 already provides a process for the retroactive collection of premiums. \nCurrent MA regulations set forth at \n\u00a7 422.270 do not contain requirements for MA organizations to refund or recover incorrect collections of cost- sharing or premiums with regard to a de minimis amount or a lookback period. On the contrary, \u00a7 422.270(b) states that an MA organization must agree to refund all amounts incorrectly collected from its Medicare enrollees, or from others on behalf of the enrollees, and to pay any other amounts due the enrollees or others on their behalf. With regard to timing of recovering underpayments when an enrollee is not at fault, \u00a7 422.262(h) states an enrollee may make payments by equal monthly installment spread out over at least the same period for which the premiums were due, or through other arrangements mutually acceptable to the enrollee and the Medicare Advantage organization.

Consistent with that operational policy, we do not review applications that are submitted after the established deadline. Entities submitting applications after the deadline do not receive a new or expanded Part C (either a general MA contract or approval to offer a SNP) or D contract for the following benefit year. An entity missing the deadline also does not receive a notice of intent to deny under \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(c)(2) or 423.503(c)(2) and is not entitled to a hearing under \u00a7\u00a7 422.660 or 423.650. \nCMS noted in the final rule which \nappeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2011 titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for Contract Year 2012 and Other Changes\u2019\u2019 (76 FR 21431), hereafter referred to as the April 2011 final rule, that, in order to meet the submission deadline, some entities had submitted applications that were so lacking in required information as to fail to constitute a valid submission (76 FR 21527). If permitted to proceed with such an application, the entity would be able to complete their application by taking advantage of two later opportunities (including the period following the notice of intent to deny) to cure deficiencies. These \u2018\u2018placeholder\u2019\u2019 applications would allow entities more time to submit complete applications than applicants that submitted complete applications by the application deadline. We stated in the preamble to the April 2011 final rule that we considered this an abuse of the application review process and have therefore treated such substantially incomplete applications as invalid since the enactment of the April 2011 final rule. \nIn the April 2011 final rule, we stated \nthat we believed that substantially incomplete applications were submitted in part because of confusion about our authority to enforce the application deadline (76 FR 21527). This confusion was likely a result of the then-effective provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(c)(2)(i) and 423.503(c)(2)(i), which stated that CMS would provide an applicant a notice of intent to deny when the entity \u2018\u2018has not provided enough information to evaluate the application.\u2019\u2019 We stated that we had intended this language to afford an entity that had made a good faith effort to complete an application the opportunity to provide materials necessary to cure discrete application deficiencies, not to provide an unintended protection and additional time to entities that submitted \u2018\u2018placeholder\u2019\u2019 applications. In order to correct this misunderstanding and to allow us to enforce our application submission deadline, CMS amended the regulation to remove the quoted language in \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(c)(2)(i) and 423.503(c)(2)(i). Since that time, we have treated substantially incomplete applications as invalid applications that are not entitled to a notice of intent to deny or a hearing under \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(c)(2) or 423.503(c)(2) or entitled to a hearing under \u00a7\u00a7 422.660 or 423.650.

This proposed modification to the regulatory text is consistent with the longstanding policy to treat substantially incomplete applications as if they were not submitted by the application deadline and therefore the submitting entity is not entitled to review of its submitted material or an opportunity to cure deficiencies. \nWe also propose at \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(a)(3)(ii) \nand 423.503(a)(4)(ii) to codify our definition of a substantially incomplete application as one that does not include responsive materials to one or more sections of its MA or Part D application, respectively. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 422.501(c) and 423.502(c), CMS requires entities seeking to qualify as an MAO (or to qualify to offer a SNP) and/or Part D sponsor to submit an application in the form and manner required by CMS. Applications for service area expansions are subject to the same rules and review processes as we treat the expansion of a plan service area as a new application for a new area. We prescribe the form and manner in an application published annually. This application is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act review process. The form and manner vary somewhat from year to year, but \ngenerally include several sections that require an entity to demonstrate compliance with specific categories of program requirements. For instance, Part D applications for new Part D contracts include: (1) a series of attestations whereby the applicant agrees that it understands and complies with various program requirements; (2) a contracting section that requires entities to demonstrate compliance with Part D requirements by submitting certain first tier, downstream, and related entity contracts and network pharmacy templates; (3) a network section that requires entities to submit lists of contracted pharmacies that meet geographic and other access requirements; (4) a program integrity section that requires entities to submit documentation that they have documented and implemented an effective compliance program as required by \u00a7 423.504(b)(vi); and (5) a licensure and solvency section that requires entities to meet applicable licensure and fiscal solvency requirements. MA applications require substantially similar information related to the operation of an MA plan, and SNP applications include additional sections related specifically to SNP requirements for the type of SNP the applicant seeks to offer. Consistent with past practice, CMS proposes to treat an application that does not include required content or responsive materials for one or more of these sections as substantially incomplete. In our assessment, applications that fail to include significant amounts of responsive materials, including failing to include required content or responsive material for any section of the application, in materials submitted by the application submission deadline are merely submitting placeholder applications that do not merit additional opportunities to meet CMS requirements. \nAn example of a Part D application \nthat would be incomplete and therefore excluded from further consideration under the proposed rule is one that failed to upload a retail pharmacy list that would allow CMS to determine whether it met pharmacy access requirements. This would include failure to submit a list at all, submitting a list containing fictitious pharmacies, or submitting a list that contained so few pharmacies that CMS could only conclude that no good faith effort had been made to create a complete network. CMS would also deem as substantially incomplete any application that failed to submit any executed contracts with first tier, downstream, or related entities that the applicant had identified as providing Part D services on its behalf. \nAn example of a MA application that \nwould be incomplete and therefore excluded from further consideration is one that failed to upload either a State license or documentation that the State received a licensure application from the applicant before the CMS application due date.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "252241e1-d9ee-4aee-878b-eeb0c320eba2": {"__data__": {"id_": "252241e1-d9ee-4aee-878b-eeb0c320eba2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b4437c6-1a13-4b7b-bd20-4eac05c733a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "87427c1ac08ae0bc12fda3e544afe72026162e358638f955d9a5f698b736c774"}, "2": {"node_id": "9534b745-6a6d-4bcd-bfc5-f9e1d1376ec4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "95488c0db1e56d7f98bed102567902d29e689ceaf6342c7df5e08460acaef196"}}, "hash": "2c0da7c171fad3695df8d7dd05b7d4472cc07e0a1f8c266f3afe9af852e850f9", "text": "Another example of an incomplete MA application would be one that failed to upload network adequacy materials, including failing to submit network lists for designated provider types, submitting fictitious providers, or submitting a list that contained so few providers that CMS could only conclude that no good faith effort had been made to create a complete network. \nAn example of a SNP application that \nwould be incomplete and therefore excluded from further consideration is one that failed to upload a model of care (MOC) that would allow CMS to determine whether or not it met MOC element requirements. This would include failure to submit MOC documents at all or submitting incomplete documents that did not contain all of the required MOC elements. \nFinally, we propose at \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.502(a)(3)(iii) and 423.503(a)(4)(iii) to explicitly state that determinations that an application is substantially incomplete are not contract determinations as defined at \u00a7\u00a7 422.641 and 423.641, respectively. Because they are not contract determinations, determinations that an application is substantially incomplete are not entitled to receipt of specific notices or appeal under Parts 422 and 423, subpart N. CMS has consistently taken this position when determining an application is substantially incomplete because a submission that is so incomplete as to not be deemed a valid application did not meet the application deadline and cannot be meaningfully reviewed. Nevertheless, a few entities have used the contract determination hearing process to appeal CMS\u2019s determination that they did not submit a substantially complete application by the application deadline. In such cases, the Hearing Officer has ruled that such determinations were not contract determinations entitled to hearings under \u00a7\u00a7 422.660 and 423.650. \nCMS does not believe that our \nproposed regulatory provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 422.502(a)(3)(i) and 423.503(a)(4)(i) will have a significant impact on the Part C or D programs. Only a handful of entities have attempted to submit substantially incomplete applications in recent years. CMS believes that codifying our treatment of substantially incomplete applications will further discourage entities from submitting placeholder applications and ensure that materials submitted by the application deadline represent entities\u2019 good faith efforts to meet application requirements. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \n3.

This threshold is based on the Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons (67 FR 41455 through 41472, published in June 2002) that implemented Executive Order 13166 (signed in August 2000). In addition, per \u00a7 417.428, cost plans with contracts under section 1876 of the Act must follow the same marketing and communication regulations; we apply the same standards to cost plans under this regulation based on our authority in section 1876(i)(3)(D) of the Act.

As discussed in the May 2022 final rule, CMS considers the materials required under \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e) and 423.2267(e) to be vital to the beneficiary decision making process; ensuring beneficiaries with limited English proficiency are aware of and are able to access interpreter services therefore provides a clear path for this portion of the population to properly understand and access their benefits (87 FR 27821). \nIn addition, MA organizations and \nPart D sponsors must comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, and implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 92. The regulations at 45 CFR 92.102(b) require plans to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including interpreters and information in alternate formats, to individuals with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, where necessary to afford such persons an equal opportunity to benefit from the service in question. Section 92.102(b)(1) defines the auxiliary aids and services for plans to provide to enrollees. For written materials this includes but is not limited to braille, large print, data/audio files, relay services, and TTY communications. We further explained the obligation of plans to provide accessible communications for individuals with disabilities in an August 30, 2017, Health Plan Management System memorandum titled, \u2018\u2018Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Accessible Communications for Individuals with Disabilities, Pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care \nAct (Section 1557).\u2019\u2019\n98 \nHowever, CMS has learned from \noversight activities, enrollee complaints, and stakeholder feedback that enrollees often must make a separate request each time they would like a material in an alternate language or need auxiliary aids and services. In addition, during CMS program audits and oversight activities we have found that special needs plans (SNPs) do not always translate individualized care plans (ICPs) into enrollees\u2019 preferred languages, even when the enrollee has expressed a preference for translation as part of completing the health risk assessment. To address these issues, we are proposing here, based on our authority under the Medicare statute, to adopt regulations to impose additional Medicare marketing and communications standards on plans to ensure access to important information and materials for individuals who have limited English proficiency or need auxiliary aids or services. \nThe materials required under \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e) and 423.2267(e) and ICPs are vital to how individuals access services and make decisions about their health care. These materials furnish important information about coverage and benefits under Medicare health and drug plans. We believe this proposal will make it easier for beneficiaries to understand the full scope of available Medicare benefits (as well as Medicaid benefits available through the D\u2013SNPs, where applicable), increasing their ability to make informed health care decisions, and promote a more equitable health care system by increasing the likelihood that MA enrollees have access to information and necessary health care. \nThe U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2019 \nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) 1- year estimates show that 12.2 percent of individuals 65 years of age and older speak a language other than English in the home.\n99Nearly 8 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries are individuals with limited English proficiency, many of whom need an interpreter or other language assistance to communicate \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6025873-5a5a-4b80-8871-1080e7313628": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6025873-5a5a-4b80-8871-1080e7313628", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1e71941-8786-497a-a429-97f7229b3858", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "48ff93be09c28ecc1e8fe8da56a07e4c29c5ec94ebced15dc2c94137586bc628"}, "3": {"node_id": "62717ddd-3d52-470f-8dff-77bfebd7f5dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "50ab223b5a4a5e57ca21bf23fe6ff682d12cfbc28593b968f8afea5400aff147"}}, "hash": "fba6717c86a0e5515bf5338325cad2da63fa30cfc9db4d54e7fd2542b0b26cce", "text": "79522 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n100Refer to https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/ \nAgency-Information/OMH/Downloads/Language- \nAccess-Plan.pdf. \n101Refer to https://data.census.gov/cedsci/ \ntable?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.census.gov%2Fcedsci%2Ftable%3Fq%3DS1810%26tid%3DACSST1Y2019.S1810%26hidePreview%3Dfalse&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1810. \n102Refer to https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/ \nfull/10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.435. \n103Refer to https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/ \nAgency-Information/OMH/Downloads/Language- Access-Plan.pdf. \n104Refer to https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/ \n10.1377/forefront.20200724.76821/full/. 105Refer to https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/ \nAgency-Information/OMH/Downloads/Language- Access-Plan.pdf. \n106Refer to https://www.cms.gov/files/document/ \nomh-visual-sensory-disabilities-brochure-508c.pdf. effectively.100The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s \n2019 American Community Survey 1 \nyear estimate also finds that 2.3 percent of the population is blind or low vision and 3.6 percent are deaf or have hearing loss, with 13.7 percent of adults over 65 reporting hearing loss or deafness, and 6 percent of adults over age 65 reporting blindness or low-vision.\n101 \nCommunication and language barriers are associated with decreased quality of care and poorer health outcomes. In addition, individuals with limited English proficiency are less likely to have routine health visits, more likely to defer needed health care, and more likely to leave the hospital against medical advice.\n102Effective \ncommunication is critical to providing high-quality care. Reliance on unqualified individuals to interpret medical information can lead to misunderstandings, poor outcomes, or even death.\n103 \nWe believe that it is a substantial \nburden for enrollees to have to request each material in an alternate language or request auxiliary aids and services for each material and that requiring \nenrollees to do so could impede access to care. It is also possible that enrollees may require both auxiliary aids and services for materials and an alternate language (for example Spanish braille). In addition, to ensure the ICPs are developed in consultation with the enrollee as required at \u00a7 422.101(f)(1)(ii), it is important that ICP materials be provided in the enrollee\u2019s preferred language and, where appropriate, in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services. Studies consistently show the negative health outcomes that patients with limited English proficiency experience due to the barriers they encounter when interacting with their doctors and care team members, accessing interpreters, and addressing insurance concerns. These outcomes are further exacerbated by vulnerable patients often not knowing their right to have qualified interpreters and other language access provisions at no extra cost.\n104We have \nbecome attuned to this issue through our work with Medicare-Medicaid Plans \n(MMPs). In 2019, CMS conducted a review of MMPs to learn how they capture, record, and use enrollees\u2019 language preferences and any need for auxiliary aids and services. We found that MMPs use multiple enrollee touch points to capture this information, including welcome calls, health risk assessments, nurse advice lines, and other interactions associated with member services, enrollment, prescription services, appeals and grievances, and care management. To collect and store this information, MMPs have taken steps such as establishing centralized email accounts within their organizations to capture all translation and auxiliary aid and service requests they receive and to ensure greater consistency and completion of requests, developing database reports that list their enrollees and any identified language or auxiliary aid or service preferences, and storing the information in their eligibility system. \nAs a result, we believe that there are \nmany ways for MA organizations and Part D sponsors to learn of an enrollee\u2019s need for auxiliary aids and services and language preferences and maintain this information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62717ddd-3d52-470f-8dff-77bfebd7f5dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "62717ddd-3d52-470f-8dff-77bfebd7f5dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1e71941-8786-497a-a429-97f7229b3858", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "48ff93be09c28ecc1e8fe8da56a07e4c29c5ec94ebced15dc2c94137586bc628"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6025873-5a5a-4b80-8871-1080e7313628", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fba6717c86a0e5515bf5338325cad2da63fa30cfc9db4d54e7fd2542b0b26cce"}}, "hash": "50ab223b5a4a5e57ca21bf23fe6ff682d12cfbc28593b968f8afea5400aff147", "text": "The CMS Guide to Developing a Language Access Plan can provide MA organizations and Part D sponsors with helpful information to ensure that persons with limited English proficiency have meaningful access to services.\n105In addition, the Improving \nCommunication Access for Individuals Who are Blind or Have Low Vision brochure can similarly assist organizations in developing policies to better serve these individuals.\n106We \nencourage plans to educate enrollees on the availability of translated materials and accessible formats using auxiliary aids and services through such avenues as enrollee newsletters, advertising, or other educational forums. MA plans may use a reward program, as permitted \nunder \u00a7 422.134, to provide rewards as a means to encourage enrollees to provide information regarding their need for an alternate language or auxiliary aids and services; in our view, providing this information to the MA plan promotes improved health and the efficient use of healthcare resources (as required by \u00a7 422.134 for reward programs) as it ensures that materials and information are adequately furnished to be understood and used by the enrollee in understanding and accessing covered benefits. \nWe would like to minimize barriers to \nenrollees receiving materials in alternate languages and accessible formats using auxiliary aids and services and remove any ambiguity associated with MA and Part D plan responsibilities for providing materials in alternate languages and accessible formats using auxiliary aids or services and for SNPs to provide ICPs in alternate languages and accessible formats using auxiliary aids and services. Therefore, we propose to re-designate the paragraphs at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(3) and 423.2267(a)(3) as \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(5) and 423.2267(a)(5) and add new paragraphs at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(3) and 423.2267(a)(3) to require MA organizations and Part D sponsors to provide materials to enrollees on a standing basis in any non-English languages that is the primary language of at least 5 percent of the individuals in a plan benefit package service area as defined under \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(2), 423.2267(a)(2) and proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(4) and 423.2267(a)(4), which are is discussed later in this section, and in any accessible formats using auxiliary aids and services upon receiving a request for the materials in another language or using auxiliary aids and services or otherwise learning of the enrollee\u2019s preferred language or need for an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services. This means that once a plan learns of an enrollee\u2019s preferred language and/or need for auxiliary aids and services\u2014whether through an enrollee requesting a material in a preferred language or using auxiliary aids and services, during a health risk assessment, or another touch point\u2014the plan must provide required materials in that language and/or accessible format using auxiliary aids and services as long as the enrollee remains enrolled in the plan or until the enrollee requests that the plan provide required materials in a different manner. We have also proposed language at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(3) and 423.2267(a)(3) to extend this requirement to the individualized plans of care described in \u00a7 422.101(f)(1)(ii) for SNP enrollees. The proposed requirement would allow enrollees to avoid having to submit a request to receive required materials in a preferred language and/or using auxiliary aids and services each time the MA or Part D plan distributes a required material. We note that plans are responsible for providing materials in both a preferred format and using auxiliary aids and services when needed (for example Spanish braille).

MA and Part D plans must comply with both the rules at \u00a7 422.2267 and \u00a7 423.2267 and the non- discrimination requirements in 45 CFR part 92. Where one set of regulations imposes a higher or different standard but it is not impossible for the plan to comply with both, the plan must comply with both. Because cost plans, per \u00a7 417.428, are subject to the regulations in part 422, subpart V, these requirements also apply to cost plans. \nThere are no information collections \nrelated to creating a standing request for translated materials or materials using auxiliary aids and services. We believe the burden associated with these proposed requirements is exempt from the requirements of PRA as defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) because the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with the requirement would be incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities. We believe most cost plans, MA organizations, and Part D sponsors have translators on staff or access them via contractors because of existing translation and auxiliary aid requirements. \n2. Require FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and \nApplicable Integrated Plans To Translate Materials Into the Medicare Translation Standard Plus Additional Medicaid Languages \nOver 1.8 million individuals dually \neligible for the Medicare and Medicaid programs speak a language other than English at home or do not speak English fluently.\n107In addition, dual eligibility \nis a strong predictor of poorer outcomes in an array of Medicare programs,\n108 \nand dually eligible beneficiaries are far more likely than other Medicare beneficiaries to be from racial or ethnic minority groups (48 percent vs. 22 \npercent). Many dually eligible beneficiaries have low health literacy yet need to navigate a more complex system of coverage than non-dually eligible beneficiaries. \nPer the definition of specialized MA \nplans for special needs individuals in \u00a7 422.2, all SNPs must be MA\u2013PDs that comply with both Part 422 and Part 423 requirements. Sections 422.2267(a)(2) \nand 423.2267(a)(2) require dual eligible special needs plans (D\u2013SNPs), like all other MA\u2013PD plans, to translate materials into any non-English language that is the primary language of at least 5 percent of the individuals in a plan benefit package service area. We propose to amend \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 and 423.2267 with a new paragraph (a)(4) that requires that FIDE SNPs and HIDE SNPs, as defined at \u00a7 422.2, and applicable integrated plans (AIPs), as defined at \u00a7 422.561, translate all Medicare materials listed in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e) and 423.2267(e) into any languages required by the Medicaid translation standard as specified through their capitated Medicaid managed care contract in addition to the language(s) required by the Medicare translation standard at \u00a7 422.2267(a)(2). Generally, we expect that the Medicaid translation requirements would be the regulatory standard at \u00a7 438.10; however, a State may impose a higher or more stringent translation requirement on its Medicaid managed care plans than is required by \u00a7 438.10, so we believe referring to the capitated Medicaid managed care contract rather than \u00a7 438.10 is appropriate for this proposed new requirement. Specifically, \u00a7 438.10(d)(3) requires that entities make written materials that are critical to obtaining services available in the prevalent non-English languages in the service area. Section 438.10(a) defines prevalent as a non-English language determined to be spoken by a significant number or percentage of potential enrollees and enrollees that are limited English proficient. Section 438.10(d)(1) requires that the State establish a methodology for identifying the prevalent non-English languages spoken by enrollees and potential enrollees throughout the State.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e348ab5-3c39-41ff-9fc8-db4742308d77": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e348ab5-3c39-41ff-9fc8-db4742308d77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "45eb9f06-e8e8-4223-8ee4-0588755c9b2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ef2b38d14b040246a176d930deb57d6fb9a4361d6259321f7db5e45698a92954"}, "2": {"node_id": "83a0e893-dc8a-4148-be49-3d1d9afd94e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "645adbfcbd7235304fe6688946261648c21e06a2972c8a89e950749d87e0063c"}}, "hash": "94f5064087337b71c6782bd419a7c3cc20c8ea9faa7fb90d6a00521be52fd82f", "text": "Under the definitions for FIDE SNP, HIDE SNP, and AIP, each of these types of plan has a companion or affiliated Medicaid managed care plan, which would itself be subject to \u00a7 438.10 and the applicable State\u2019s translation requirements for Medicaid materials described in \n\u00a7 438.10. We propose to extend the translation standards applicable to the Medicaid materials used by FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs to the Medicare materials used by those plans to ensure that the dually eligible enrollees in all FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs receive all of the materials necessary for accessing and understanding all of their benefits (both Medicare and Medicaid) in a language that the enrollees understand. For example, if current \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 \nand 423.2267 only require translation \ninto Spanish for Medicare materials but the State Medicaid agency requires translation into Chinese as well as English and Spanish, then our proposed revisions to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 and 423.2267 would also require that the affected FIDE SNP, HIDE SNP, or AIP translate the Medicare materials listed in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e) and 423.2267(e) into Chinese as well as Spanish. \nThese modifications at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 \nand 423.2267 do not create exceptions to other laws that govern translation of written materials provided to enrollees that we have previously described. Rather, our intent is to make it easier for dually eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, or AIPs to understand the full scope of Medicare and Medicaid benefits available through such D\u2013SNPs, which would increase their ability to make informed health care decisions. It would also reduce the likelihood of an enrollee receiving materials in different languages (for example, some in English and some in Spanish) depending on whether the materials are governed by Medicare or Medicaid requirements. \nWe are considering applying the \nproposed new requirement to additional or different groups of D\u2013SNPs, such as limiting the proposal to AIPs or to organizations with D\u2013SNP-only contracts as described under \u00a7 422.107(e), or expanding the requirement to all D\u2013SNPs and D\u2013SNP look-alikes (that is, the MA plans that meet the standards in \u00a7 422.514(d)) during a period before the D\u2013SNP look- alike plan is nonrenewed or terminated. We decided to focus our proposal on all FIDE SNPs and HIDE SNPs, as defined at \u00a7 422.2, and AIPs, as defined at \u00a7 422.561, because these plans have capitated contracts with State Medicaid agencies and must already translate Medicaid materials to comply with their Medicaid managed care contracts, and would likely either have staff that are capable of translating materials into these languages or contract with organizations to perform these translations. In addition, an increasing number of dual eligible individuals are in FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs where the same organization provides \ncoverage of both the Medicare and Medicaid services for the enrollee. \nWe understand that our proposal \nwould require some FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs to translate the Medicare materials listed in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e) and 423.2267(e) into additional languages.

Likewise, section 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(vi) of the Act directs that the Secretary use rules similar to and coordinated with the MA rules at section 1851(h) of the Act for approval of marketing materials and application forms for Part D plan sponsors. Section 1860D\u20134(l) of the Act applies certain prohibitions under section 1851(h) of the Act to Part D sponsors in the same manner as such provisions apply to MA organizations. \nIn addition, under section 1852(c) and 1860D\u20134(a) of the Act, CMS can require organizations to provide certain materials to Medicare beneficiaries concerning MA and Part D plan choices. These statutory provisions help ensure Medicare beneficiaries are informed and protected when making an election to enroll in an MA (including MAPD) or Part D plan. We believe the changes proposed in this regulation strengthen CMS\u2019 ability to ensure MA and Part D marketing to beneficiaries is not misleading, inaccurate, or confusing.

Sections 422.2261(a)(3) and 423.2261(a)(3) prohibit third-party and downstream entities from submitting materials directly to CMS, unless specified by CMS. Following an operational change in May 2021, CMS began permitting TPMOs to submit certain marketing materials. In cases where a TPMO document only markets one MA organization/Part D sponsor, there would be no change for the TPMO, meaning they would still send the document in through the MA organization/Part D sponsor who would submit it into HPMS. For TPMOs that develop materials for more than one MA organization/Part D sponsor, the TPMO would submit the material directly to CMS. Based on CMS\u2019 operational change we are proposing to require TPMOs, as defined at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2260 and 423.2260, to submit their marketing materials developed for multiple MA organizations and Part D sponsors (and their specific plans) to CMS through HPMS. Specifically, we are proposing to remove \u00a7\u00a7 422.2261(a)(3) and 423.2261(a)(3), which as implemented prohibited TPMOs from submitting materials the TPMO alone developed, and modifying \u00a7\u00a7 422.2261(a)(2) and 423.2261(a)(2) to require that where marketing materials have been developed by a TPMO for multiple plans, the TPMO must submit those materials that the TPMO has designed and developed to CMS, and such submission may only occur after the TPMO receives the prior approval of each of the MA organizations or Part D sponsors on whose behalf the materials \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e98f4790-2b24-4a1e-ae1e-8deb68d538ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "e98f4790-2b24-4a1e-ae1e-8deb68d538ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88354df2-7555-4284-b7a7-9a0900bd3e94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7d8a4581727de432f23658bda7efb7c24fc5c8b726e01b558b9641cdcfafa49a"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d271e2d-84d2-413c-8851-cafabdfcf7c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d56a77d9e1ecc51e48387450b759746ccb1ed748df17668db44ea8fc2660f482"}}, "hash": "3a91d81232d0ea98f4f9e31e3c5c556d9684f8e043361616a304b8e2ca7adac7", "text": "79525 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nwere designed and developed by the \nTPMO. \nThe HPMS is CMS\u2019 system of record \nfor marketing materials. In the January 19, 2021 final rule, we modified \u00a7\u00a7 422.2261(a)(3) and 423.2261(a)(3) to provide CMS the flexibility to allow third parties to submit materials directly to CMS in the future (86 FR 5998). CMS made this modification in anticipation of changes to HPMS. CMS released an updated marketing module in HPMS in May of 2021. Prior to this release, third- party materials were submitted into HPMS, but the TPMO was required to send materials to an MA organization or Part D sponsor and have the MA organization or Part D sponsor submit the materials on the TPMO\u2019s behalf. System changes in 2021 permitted third parties and downstream entities, such as TPMOs, to submit materials directly to CMS following the receipt of prior approval from at least one MA organization or Part D sponsor. The January 19, 2021 final rule enabled the agency to allow submission by third parties and downstream entities because of the timing and uncertainty of the revamped HPMS marketing module. \nSince issuing the January 19, 2021 \nfinal rule, we have modified HPMS so that TPMOs may submit materials that are being used for multiple MA organizations, Part D sponsors, or plans. We are now proposing to require, rather than permit, TPMOs submit to CMS any material that the TPMO develops for multiple MA organizations and Part D sponsors that meets the definition of marketing and that TPMOs receive prior approval, by each MA organization or Part D sponsor, of the material being submitted on behalf of each of the MA organization or Part D sponsor. Failing to require submission may result in these materials not being subject to CMS review. Thus, we are proposing to remove \u00a7\u00a7 422.2261(a)(3) and 423.2261(a)(3) and modify \u00a7\u00a7 422.2261(a)(2) and 423.2261(a)(2) to add that TPMOs must submit their materials designed on behalf of and with prior approval from the applicable MA organizations or Part D sponsors. \nCMS is proposing to add a new (xix) \nto \u00a7 422.2262(a)(1) and a new (xviii) to \u00a7 423.2262(a)(1) to address the use of the Medicare name, CMS logo, and products or information issued by the Federal \nGovernment, including the Medicare card. CMS is aware of concerns from external stakeholders about marketing activities and documents that appear to be from Medicare, CMS, or the Federal Government. Through beneficiary complaints and CMS surveillance activities, over the years, we have seen the word \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 in names of store fronts (that is, The Medicare Store), on notices or postcards where \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 is in large font while disclaimers are miniscule, and in television advertisements where a beneficiary could think that the advertising is coming from CMS. We have also seen logos, which are very similar to the Health and Human Services (HHS) logo on websites and print materials. These logos have featured circles with writing around the circle and a bird, wings or other images that appear to be the same image used by the Federal Government. In addition to the store front, postcards, and television advertisements, there are also numerous third-party internet sites with \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 in the URL or a logo similar to the HHS logo, potentially causing a beneficiary to click on a private site when they intend to go to Medicare.gov or are seeking official \nMedicare information or access. Often, it appears as if the materials urging the beneficiary to \u2018\u2018take action\u2019\u2019 are from Medicare or that these third parties represent Medicare or the Federal Government. With the increase of third parties in the marketplace, based on CMS\u2019 surveillance and complaints received, especially through 1\u2013800\u2013 MEDICARE, we are concerned that an increasing number of beneficiaries are being misled into believing the entity they are contacting is Medicare or the Federal Government.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d271e2d-84d2-413c-8851-cafabdfcf7c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d271e2d-84d2-413c-8851-cafabdfcf7c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88354df2-7555-4284-b7a7-9a0900bd3e94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7d8a4581727de432f23658bda7efb7c24fc5c8b726e01b558b9641cdcfafa49a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e98f4790-2b24-4a1e-ae1e-8deb68d538ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3a91d81232d0ea98f4f9e31e3c5c556d9684f8e043361616a304b8e2ca7adac7"}}, "hash": "d56a77d9e1ecc51e48387450b759746ccb1ed748df17668db44ea8fc2660f482", "text": "One specific example, provided by a Medicare beneficiary, is a postcard with the beneficiary-named address with \u2018\u2018Medicare Notice\u2019\u2019 in large, bold letters at the top along with \u2018\u2018Personal & Confidential\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Important Medicare Information.\u2019\u2019 This postcard also had a \u2018\u2018Medicare Information\u2019\u2019 box listing a \u2018\u2018Customer ID\u2019\u2019, formatted to look like an official Medicare beneficiary number. This misleading postcard appeared to be an official document disseminated by the Federal Government. In our review of complaints received through 1\u2013800\u2013 MEDICARE, CMS discovered other examples of beneficiaries who mistakenly believed they were calling Medicare rather than a private MA or Part D plan or its agent or broker, likely based on the receipt of a flyer using the word \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 in a way that conveyed to the beneficiary that they must call the telephone number on the mailer. These complaints illustrate that the use of the Medicare name is at times confusing and misleading to Medicare beneficiaries. \nA top CMS priority, consistent with \nsections 1851(h)(2) and 1860D\u2013 01(b)(1)(B)(vi) of the Act and CMS\u2019s implementing regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2262 and 423.2262, is to ensure that MA organizations and Part D sponsors \ndisseminate information to beneficiaries that is accurate and not misleading. We are therefore concerned that the use of the term \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 in situations like those described above erroneously leads beneficiaries to believe that Medicare- related communications or advertising are disseminated or endorsed by Medicare or the Federal Government, when in actuality such communications are being disseminated by the MA organizations/Part D sponsors themselves, or by entities operating on behalf of the MA organizations or Part D sponsors. Although the types of plan communications described above that feature the word \u2018\u2018Medicare\u2019\u2019 typically include disclaimers that state the information presented is not connected to or endorsed by the Federal Government or the Medicare program, these disclaimers are often tiny, difficult to read, and are mixed in with other CMS required disclaimers as well as plan-developed, non-required, disclaimers. While CMS already prohibits inaccurate or misleading information under \u00a7\u00a7 422.2262(a)(1)(i) and 423.2262(a)(1)(i), we believe it is important to specifically prohibit the misleading use of the Medicare name, CMS logo, and products or information issued by the Federal Government (including the Medicare card) in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2262(a)(1) and 423.2262(a)(1). We are not including the Medicare Part D mark, as CMS gives Part D sponsors contractual permission to use the mark. By adding a new (xix) and (xviii) we are firmly and clearly prohibiting the improper use of these terms and logos. Therefore, we propose adding a new paragraph (xix) to \u00a7 422.2262(a)(1) and a new (xviii) to \u00a7 423.2262(a)(1) which specifically prohibits the use of the Medicare name, CMS logo, or official products, including the Medicare card, in a misleading manner. \nSince CMS contracts with MA \norganizations and Part D sponsors, CMS holds these organizations accountable for the actions of their first tier, downstream and related entities, per \u00a7\u00a7 422.504(i) and 423.505(i). If CMS determines that the Medicare name, CMS logo, or official products like the Medicare card, have been used in a misleading manner by a first tier, downstream or related entity (FDR), CMS would address the issue with the MA organization or Part D sponsor on whose behalf the FDR was operating and hold the sponsoring organization accountable for the misleading information. \nIn our January 2021 final rule, we \nprohibited plan use of unsubstantiated \nstatements except those used in taglines \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b56e5e-7142-4378-87fc-0e038bdfa218": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b56e5e-7142-4378-87fc-0e038bdfa218", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae7383f9-a136-4696-a6e7-9cb15ef26432", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "791801b64dd9fbde24d81a211170575e35ff85c456e134f4c294972fab80d034"}, "3": {"node_id": "54cb8478-7268-4cce-adcd-a355753240cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d1b63afe352df446d998682cf09fe9b4a1066491446d1d8b7acb09970812c991"}}, "hash": "ad49c13976974f72be92029c755c368c2ac3606ea1d6a6b52b25ee73e5af6be4", "text": "79526 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n109https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ \nManagedCareMarketing/Downloads/2016- \nMedicare-Marketing-Guidelines-Updated.pdf. and logos in 42 CFR 422.2262(a)(1)(ii) \nand 423.2262(a)(1)(ii). Prior to the January 2021 final rule, we had prohibited the use of unsubstantiated superlatives and pejoratives, except when used in logos and taglines, through our Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidance. We now propose to further restrict the use of superlatives by prohibiting all superlatives unless substantiating supporting data is also provided with the material and essentially adopt a regulation that builds upon our prior guidance. We are proposing this for all superlatives, including those used in logos and taglines. Previously, CMS generally required plans to provide substantiating data to support the use of a superlative. However, that substantiating information was only provided to CMS, resulting in the beneficiary seeing the superlative without no context. Currently, the beneficiary has no knowledge of how the superlative is determined, potentially misleading the beneficiary to believe a statement which may be partially or mostly true, but lacking context and important specificity. For example, an MA plan may advertise that it has the largest network, which on a \nnational basis may be accurate. However, when looking at a particular service area, this MA plan may have the smallest network. Permitting the use of superlatives without specific information explaining the basis or context, is potentially misleading to beneficiaries so we have reconsidered the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 422.2262(a)(1)(ii) and 423.2262(a)(1)(ii) as previously finalized. \nCMS believes it is critical to provide \neither actual data or information, such as reports or studies, that forms the basis for a superlative statement in order for beneficiaries to review and understand the context and reference point for the superlative. This documentation and/or data can be referenced through footnotes explaining the basis, noting the source, with enough information for a beneficiary to locate, or providing the actual comparison done to determine the superlative. For example, if a plan stated that they have the lowest premiums, the plan would need to state their premium and the premiums of other plans in the service area, or reference a study, review or other documentation that supports the superlative and with which the beneficiary can make accurate comparisons between plans. \nWe are also proposing to add a \nrequirement that the supportive \ndocumentation and/or data be based on current data. Our proposed regulation \ntext requires that the supportive documentation or data must reflect data, reports, studies, or other documentation to have been published either in the existing contract year or the prior contract year. For example, a health plan could not make the statement in CY 2022 that they have the largest provider network in an area using 2018 data. Rather, in CY 2022, the statement that a health plan has the largest network in an area must be supported by documentation and/or data published as of January 1, 2021 or later. Data and the underlying situations can be dynamic and change over time, therefore, CMS is proposing that recent data, meaning the current or the prior contract year data, are the only data that \nmay be used to substantiate superlatives. We believe any data older than the prior contract year may be misleading, given the age of the data and the potential of the data to have changed. Based on this, we propose to modify paragraphs \u00a7\u00a7 422.2262(a)(1)(ii) and 423.2262(a)(1)(ii) to prohibit the use of superlatives, unless sources of documentation and/or data supportive of the superlative is also referenced in the material and to provide that such supportive documentation and/or data must reflect data, reports, studies, or other documentation that has been published in either the current contract year or prior contract year. \nIn \u00a7\u00a7 422.2263(b) and 423.2263(b) we \npropose adding a new (8) which prohibits organizations from advertising benefits not available in a service area, unless doing so is unavoidable in a local market.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54cb8478-7268-4cce-adcd-a355753240cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "54cb8478-7268-4cce-adcd-a355753240cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae7383f9-a136-4696-a6e7-9cb15ef26432", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "791801b64dd9fbde24d81a211170575e35ff85c456e134f4c294972fab80d034"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6b56e5e-7142-4378-87fc-0e038bdfa218", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ad49c13976974f72be92029c755c368c2ac3606ea1d6a6b52b25ee73e5af6be4"}}, "hash": "d1b63afe352df446d998682cf09fe9b4a1066491446d1d8b7acb09970812c991", "text": "This prohibition is codifying our previous guidance, as previously outlined in section 30.1 of the 2016 Medicare Marketing Guidelines (MMG),\n109providing that marketing \nactivities should be limited to a plan\u2019s service area unless doing so was unavoidable, such as advertising in a local newspaper that may be distributed outside a service area. In cases where marketing outside a service area was unavoidable, CMS\u2019s guidance provided that the plan\u2019s service area be disclosed. \nOver the past few years, CMS has seen \na significant increase in national marketing which promotes benefits such as dental, vision, and money back on a beneficiary\u2019s Social Security check. While many of these benefits are available to a large number of beneficiaries, they are not available in all service areas or to all Medicare beneficiaries in the amounts often advertised. For example, in 2021 there \nwere national advertisements that claimed a beneficiary \u2018\u2018could get up to $144 back\u2019\u2019 on their Social Security check, which would be accomplished through a reduction in the beneficiary\u2019s Medicare Part B premium. A premium reduction of this magnitude would have covered most of the standard 2021 Part B premium of $148.50. However, the number of counties or states where one or more available plans offered the advertised Part B premium reduction of $144 was small. In fact, for CY 2021, Florida and Puerto Rico were the only states or territories that had plans with a reduction of $140 or more, and in CY 2022 the only states or territories that had plans with a reduction of $140 or more were California, Florida and Puerto Rico. Further, although there \nwere plans available in these states, the plans offering the $140 or more buy down were not available in all counties. Since beneficiaries in more than 60% of states only have access to plans that offer a Part B premium reduction of $99.00 or less (CY 2022), advertising on a national or even regional level that a beneficiary can get up to the full amount or even close to the full amount is potentially misleading. And although over 30% of states and territories offer Part B premium reduction of $100 or more, this reduction is not available in all counties in each State and territory. These national advertisements publicize that a beneficiary can get up to a certain dollar amount (for example, $144) even if there are no plans available in that state that offer $144 or any dollar amount close to $144. CMS believes that if a plan offering \u2018\u2018up to\u2019\u2019 the top dollar amount is advertised as available for enrollment, then such a plan offering that top dollar amount should be available to beneficiaries who are receiving or exposed to the advertisement where they reside; otherwise we believe it is potentially misleading to potential enrollees. A beneficiary calling, based on an advertisement touting up to $144 back, would expect that plans would be available that would provide a reasonable Part B premium reduction. However, the actual reduction may be minimal, anywhere from $1 to $25, significantly far from the \u2018\u2018up to\u2019\u2019 advertised amount; or in other cases, there may not even be a Part B premium reduction in that particular service area. We believe this practice\u2014touting a reduction far greater than what is available has the effect of getting beneficiaries to contact the company, hoping for financial assistance, only to be told there is little to no Part B \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3864441-923e-46d9-9099-98b04ff95f81": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3864441-923e-46d9-9099-98b04ff95f81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3265a6c4-b441-4c15-ab75-383f5e54a5ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0408bc5ed74f1110bd2d597e591291dcce113edaf0104fb7fafd2323fb4192bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "05cfe7c5-cc28-4e52-9573-525b73823e5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bb65f8b6084e99c5f9f8e66d48d08fce5b836ee9834db1be544302dfb36c98ca"}}, "hash": "d1d857b8eaa7b46dd5135ec5027e1b034c9bb3d1503737ac5d50825c6e086846", "text": "79527 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n110CMS has retained the recordings of these calls. \nThe calls include sensitive information, and as \nsuch, we feel it would be inappropriate and illegal to include them as part of this public record. 111HPMS is the system of record for storing \nmarketing websites submitted to CMS for review and approval. premium reduction\u2014is a misleading \ntactic that is more likely designed to attract a beneficiary\u2019s attention so that the beneficiary will call the number and then, be subject to additional marketing and potentially switched to a plan not that is not well suited to meet the beneficiary\u2019s health care needs. \nA similar issue exists for other MA \nbenefits such as dental, vision, and hearing as well as Part D benefits, non- formulary medications and over-the- counter medications. There have been national advertisements that promote plans with high benefit amounts for certain benefits (for example, up to $2,500 in dental benefits). CMS believes advertising up to a $2,500 dental benefit on a national level is misleading when some markets may not even have access to a plan with dental or others only have access to a plan with limited dental (for example, $500). While many beneficiaries have access to MA plans with some level of additional dental, vision and hearing benefits, advertising benefits up to a large dollar amount (for example, $2,500) is misleading when the MA plan options available to a beneficiary provide a significantly lower value benefit (for example, $500). \nCMS has seen advertisements which \nmarket up to $144 dollars back on the beneficiaries\u2019 Social Security check, or thousands of dollars in hearing, dental and vision, to entice a beneficiary to call the 1\u2013800 number possibly believing they can receive the maximum amount of benefits advertised. CMS has listened to recorded calls between a beneficiary and an agent in which the beneficiary starts off by asking about how to get $144 back in their Social Security check. Based on its review of recorded calls,\n110CMS has learned that once the \nbeneficiary places a call to the advertised number, the agent may market a plan that does not provide a Part B premium reduction at all or that offers a premium reduction at a much lower level than the advertised dollar value, or a plan with more limited dental, hearing or vision than was advertised. Once the agent or broker has the beneficiary on the line, the beneficiary is either put in a position of trying to end the call or listening to an agent sell a plan in which the beneficiary was not interested, potentially leading the beneficiary into enrolling in a plan that does not offer the advertised benefits. Because of the initial call, which was based on unavailable benefits, the beneficiary may end up enrolling in a plan that does \nnot best meet the health care needs of the beneficiary. In this situation, the beneficiary may have benefited by staying in their existing plan, and may even have stayed enrolled in their existing plan, if not for the advertisement urging the beneficiary to call to \u2018\u2018get the money they deserve.\u2019\u2019 \nAs mentioned above, when a plan \nadvertises benefits which are not available to beneficiaries in the service area where the advertisement airs, that type of marketing is misleading. We believe that beneficiaries should only receive marketing that advertises benefits actually available to the beneficiary where the beneficiary resides (that is, in a service area that covers where the advertisements air). Therefore, we are proposing a new (8) \nat \u00a7\u00a7 422.2263(b) and 423.2263(b) that provides that MA organizations and Part D sponsors may not engage in marketing that advertises benefits that are not available to beneficiaries in the service area where the marketing appears unless unavoidable in a local market. \nWe are also proposing a new (9) at \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.2263(b) and 423.2263(b) that prohibits marketing unless the names of the MA organizations or Part D sponsors that offer the benefits are being advertised are clearly identified. In cases where the MA organization or Part D sponsor uses a specific marketing name, as identified in HPMS, that marketing name can be used in place of the MA organization or Part D sponsor name. CMS has seen an increase in the marketing of benefits, through television, websites, and mailers that mention additional benefits such as dental, vision, hearing, as well as low or zero-dollar premiums. These advertisements do not identify which product(s), plan(s), or specific plan(s) benefits are being advertised, but rather act as a lead generator to obtain beneficiary contact information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05cfe7c5-cc28-4e52-9573-525b73823e5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "05cfe7c5-cc28-4e52-9573-525b73823e5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3265a6c4-b441-4c15-ab75-383f5e54a5ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0408bc5ed74f1110bd2d597e591291dcce113edaf0104fb7fafd2323fb4192bd"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3864441-923e-46d9-9099-98b04ff95f81", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d1d857b8eaa7b46dd5135ec5027e1b034c9bb3d1503737ac5d50825c6e086846"}}, "hash": "bb65f8b6084e99c5f9f8e66d48d08fce5b836ee9834db1be544302dfb36c98ca", "text": "When a beneficiary calls, returns a flyer, or clicks on a link on a web page, the advertising entity (which may be either an MA organization, a Part D sponsor, or a TPMO) may be able to obtain a beneficiary\u2019s contact information, which is then used by that entity for unlimited future calls or for providing that information to other entities that then contact the beneficiary. One particular internet site\n111requires an individual to \nenter their name, email address, and phone number prior to looking at any plan information. The disclaimer at the bottom of the ad (and often in much smaller font) states \u2018\u2018By entering my contact information and clicking \u2018\u2018Next\u2019\u2019 above, I consent to receive emails, telephone calls, text messages and artificial or pre-recorded messages from. . .licensed insurance agents or their affiliates and third-party partners, regarding health insurance products and services including Medicare Advantage Plans and/or Prescription Drug Plans, at the email address and telephone number provided above, including my wireless number (if provided), using an automated telephone dialing system.\u2019\u2019 By \u2018\u2018automated telephone dialing system,\u2019\u2019 the language seems to be referring to what are commonly referred to as robo-calls. In order for the beneficiary to get any information, they are forced to agree to be contacted not just once based on the initial inquiry, but for unlimited calls, texts, and emails from the internet site they visited, as well as any other company to whom the internet site gave or sold the beneficiary\u2019s information. We do not believe beneficiaries realize or want their contact information to be provided to other entities just because the beneficiary wanted to get information about available plans from one internet site. We believe that many of the unsolicited contact complaints that CMS has received (through 1\u2013800\u2013 MEDICARE, online complaint system, anecdotally from stakeholders, etc.) are the result of a beneficiary inadvertently or unknowingly agreeing to having their personal information provided or sold to others entities, who then call the beneficiary and market MA products. \nCMS believes there are specific, \nimportant reasons for advertisements to contain MA organization and Part D sponsor names. First of all, we believe including the names in the advertisement will help the beneficiary understand that they are calling a plan or a plan representative and not Medicare, the government, or a non- partisan entity. Adding the names provides information to put the beneficiary in control of whether they even want to contact the agent because by having the name on an advertisement, the beneficiary can research the MA organization or Part D sponsor, including their Star Ratings and complaints, or discuss the plan with relatives or friends whom they trust to help make health care decisions. The beneficiary can then make a more informed decision on whether they want to contact the agent to learn about that particular plan. Without knowing the plan name, the beneficiary may find themselves in a position of listening to an agent (especially if that agent is in \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd837e5e-4dd8-440d-b609-9a8d789a305a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd837e5e-4dd8-440d-b609-9a8d789a305a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d305346e-7e9d-48a1-8b2b-50bbf6560be8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "38e24836b7c845bffd58b5014a3e3e6c3afa4fcc8a8cef89c92e2a4a2c409e51"}, "3": {"node_id": "5973a7b1-9d7b-47aa-b8c0-d727266e09c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c153c9749df5c241dfa89ac222a3182587e74f5e142d876fe86258ef5b40cdb6"}}, "hash": "91b89877ba798107397e3992773b599a883ffd390fb6695225ddcceb561ce71b", "text": "79528 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nthe beneficiary\u2019s home) market a plan \nthat the beneficiary is not interested in joining. \nNot only does this proposed policy \nassist beneficiaries, it will also assist CMS and MA organizations and Part D sponsors to ensure the marketing reflects the appropriate MA organizations and Part D sponsors. CMS is proposing to require TPMO- developed marketing to be submitted into HPMS and currently permits TPMOs to submit marketing materials into HPMS. Under our proposal, once submitted, each MA organization or Part D sponsor would decide whether they want the TPMO to use that marketing piece on their behalf. If an MA organization or Part D sponsor \u2018\u2018opts into\u2019\u2019 the piece, the TPMO may then use it on their behalf and marketing those organizations. If the MA organization or Part D sponsor \u2018\u2018opts out\u2019\u2019 of the marketing piece, then the TPMO would not have permission to market those specific organizations. By requiring MA organization and Part D sponsor names both CMS and the organization would then be able to ensure that only those MA organizations and Part D sponsors who opted into the TPMO using the piece are being advertised in that piece. And if CMS determines a piece is misleading, we will then be able to identify the organizations from the advertisement, compare them to the ones that opted in and address the issue with those organizations who opted into the TPMO piece. This will allow CMS to quickly notify the MA organization or Part D sponsor of the issues, have the organization resolve the issues, and get the misleading materials out of circulation quickly. \nTherefore, we are proposing a new (9) \nat \u00a7 422.2263(b) to prohibit MA organizations from marketing any products or plans, benefits, or costs, unless the MA organization or marketing name(s) (as listed in HPMS of the entities offering the referenced products or plans) are identified in the marketing material. We are also proposing a new (9) at \u00a7 423.2263(b) to prohibit Part D sponsors from marketing any products or plans, benefits, or costs, unless the Part D sponsor or marketing name(s) (as listed in HPMS of the entities offering the referenced products \nor plans) are identified in the marketing material. \nIn addition, we propose to set \nrequirements on how the names of the sponsoring organization are displayed or identified in marketing materials. In reviewing television, print, and online marketing, the disclaimers are often small, not displayed long enough, read too fast, or are difficult to find. We propose adding requirements in this new paragraph (9) to ensure the information is visible. We propose adding that print advertisements must have MA organization, Part D sponsor, or marketing names in 12-point font and may not be solely in the disclaimer or fine print. We use the phrase \u2018\u2018fine print\u2019\u2019 as it is generally defined to mean printed matter in small type or in an inconspicuous manner. For television, online, or social media-based advertisements, we propose that these names must either be displayed during the entire advertisement in the same font size as displayed benefits and phone numbers, or be read within the advertisement at the same pace as advertised benefits or phone numbers. For radio or other advertisements that are voice-based only, we propose that these names must be read at the same speed as the phone number. To implement these new requirements, we are proposing new paragraphs (b)(9)(A), (B), and (C), respectively. \nWe are proposing to add a new (10) \nto \u00a7\u00a7 422.2263(b) and 423.2263(b) to address the marketing of \u2018\u2018savings\u2019\u2019 for beneficiaries. As part of our marketing surveillance and reviews, CMS has seen advertisements touting that a beneficiary can save $9,000 or more on their prescription drugs, or over $7,000 in health care expenses if they join a particular MA plan or Part D plan. In the example referring to savings for prescription drugs, this advertisement included a small disclaimer stating that the \u2018\u2018savings\u2019\u2019 figure is based on the usual and customary price someone without prescription drug insurance would pay. In other examples, MA organizations, Part D sponsors, or TPMOs are marketing dual eligible Special Needs Plans (D\u2013SNPs) that provide \u2018\u2018savings\u2019\u2019 of over $7,000.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5973a7b1-9d7b-47aa-b8c0-d727266e09c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "5973a7b1-9d7b-47aa-b8c0-d727266e09c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d305346e-7e9d-48a1-8b2b-50bbf6560be8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "38e24836b7c845bffd58b5014a3e3e6c3afa4fcc8a8cef89c92e2a4a2c409e51"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd837e5e-4dd8-440d-b609-9a8d789a305a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "91b89877ba798107397e3992773b599a883ffd390fb6695225ddcceb561ce71b"}}, "hash": "c153c9749df5c241dfa89ac222a3182587e74f5e142d876fe86258ef5b40cdb6", "text": "In this situation, the \u2018\u2018savings\u2019\u2019 described in the advertisement refers to the Part B Medicare premium and copay amounts that are covered by Medicaid for fully dual-eligible beneficiaries or are the costs saved through the Prescription Drug savings program, which is based on income. However, with both of these examples, most beneficiaries are not saving the advertised amount of money because they would never have incurred many of those out-of-pocket expenses. Specifically, a beneficiary that already has prescription drug coverage (such as a current Part D plan or other creditable prescription coverage from before the individual became eligible for Medicare) would not save $9,000 in out-of-pocket costs by switching to the advertised plan because they already had coverage for their drugs through a different plan. This advertised \u2018\u2018savings\u2019\u2019 is only \napplicable if the beneficiary currently had no drug coverage, meaning they had to pay for all of their drugs out of pocket. Likewise, the above example of advertisements marketing D\u2013SNPs, the advertisements generally have very small, fine print that says the individual may need to be income eligible or Medicare and Medicaid eligible in order to receive the advertised savings. However, since dual eligible beneficiaries already have Medicaid coverage or are already in a dual plan they are not saving the full $7,000 because they never paid the full $7,000 in their old or existing plan. Further, if the beneficiary is eligible to have Medicaid pay certain costs on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf (such as payment of Part B premiums) or is protected from paying cost sharing by \u00a7 422.504(g)(1)(iii), the advertised savings are not unique to the advertised plan in any way. \nWe believe that these commercials \nand other types of advertising (for example, direct mailers) are techniques that TPMOs, MA organizations, and Part D sponsors use to entice a beneficiary into calling a 1\u2013800 number for plan X, mistakenly believing that she or he will save thousands of dollars by switching plans, as identified in the examples above. To address our concerns about beneficiaries being misled, we propose to add a new paragraph (b)(10) at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2263 and 423.2263 to prohibit MA organizations and Part D sponsors from including information about savings available to potential enrollees that are based on a comparison of typical expenses borne by uninsured individuals, unpaid costs of dually eligible beneficiaries, or other unrealized costs of a Medicare beneficiary. \nNext, we propose adding a new \nparagraph (A) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(a)(2)(i) and 423.2264(a)(2)(i) to add to the current prohibition of door-to-door solicitation. Business Reply Cards (BRC) and other types of documents where the beneficiary requests additional information are intended to allow the agent to reach out to the beneficiary via telephone, email, or direct mail. One particular agent asked CMS if the BRC gives them the legal right to visit a beneficiary\u2019s home unannounced. We do not believe a beneficiary filling out a BRC necessarily indicates a beneficiary\u2019s intention give permission for an agent to show up unannounced, at their home, requesting to market MA or Part D plans to that beneficiary. CMS considers this activity to be door-to-door \nsolicitation. Therefore, we propose adding a new (A) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(a)(2)(i) \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2ce1e20-74ca-470e-97c7-3b0267073754": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2ce1e20-74ca-470e-97c7-3b0267073754", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa1fee5a-7e2a-4630-b0c3-5b7710891788", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "054a20c782eb9bf5b2788072fc9dcc99291fc34bf9882e9534f6228081a4d2dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "2374feeb-ab14-47a2-80a4-c70f2483dad9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "258ebe3b2d5451a1fd3338be84e03373be613e6b9f5fa8bfa0d9b398679915a2"}}, "hash": "46b1701dd45b5f8ea4dfde2129dc2c5b52c622052ed0125c7f3ba8217632b042", "text": "79529 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nand 423.2264(a)(2)(i) which provides \nthat contacting a beneficiary at his or her home is considered to be door-to- door solicitation unless an appointment at the beneficiary\u2019s home at the applicable date and time was previously scheduled. \nCurrently, regulations at \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(b) and 423.2264(b) permit MA organizations and Part D sponsors to contact existing members, and to a limited extent, former members, as plan business. In \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(b) and 423.2264(b) we define plan business activities to include calling current members to discuss Medicare products. In addition, in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(b)(2) and 423.2264(b)(2), we currently require that MA organization and Part D sponsors provide beneficiaries an opportunity to opt out of being contacted concerning plan business. However, we have interpreted and implemented this regulation as requiring MA organizations and Part D sponsors to present the opt-out opportunity one time, regardless of how many subsequent contacts an enrollee receives. We are proposing, in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(b)(2) and 423.2264(b)(2), a change that would require each MA organization and Part D sponsor to provide the opt-out information to all its enrollees, regardless of plan intention to contact, at least annually in writing, instead of just one time. Over time, beneficiaries may realize that having plans contact them regarding marketing is not necessary. Beneficiaries, by only receiving the opt-out option once under current regulations, may fail to realize that they have the option to opt out at any time. By requiring a written annual notification from plans, our proposed new requirement will ensure beneficiaries are reminded that they may decide at any time to opt out of being contacted by their MA organization/Part D Sponsor about plan business. \nTherefore, we are proposing MA \norganizations/Part D Sponsors provide beneficiaries with additional notice, in an annual written communication, about their ability to opt out of being contacted about plan business. We are deferring to plans on how best to communicate this, as we believe that they are in the best position to develop appropriate language based on the plan business they conduct. In addition, we are not proposing the specific written format that plans must utilize when communicating this information during the year, nor specifying when the plan must provide this information during each contract year. MA organizations/ \nPart D sponsors may provide this opt- out notification as a single letter, in a welcome packet, or another method of \nwritten communication. The enrollee\u2019s decision to opt out of contacts for purposes of plan business will remain in effect until an enrollee chooses to opt in. We solicit comment on whether CMS should expand the existing and proposed notice requirements in some fashion as a way to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are not marketed MA/Part D plans in a way that is similar enough to cold calling that it should be prohibited. \nOur regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c) and \n423.2264(c) regulate what is permitted at sales and educational events as well as conduct that is prohibited at these events. Currently, MA organizations and Part D sponsors, including agents and brokers, may not market specific MA/ Part D plans or benefits at educational events. However, CMS currently permits MA organizations and Part D sponsors participating in educational events to set up future personal marketing appointments and to collect beneficiary contact information including Scope of Appointment forms (SOAs) at educational events. Our regulations also permit marketing events to immediately follow an educational event, provided the beneficiary is made aware of the change and is given an opportunity to leave prior to the beginning of the marketing event. \nIn 2018, prior to the implementation \nof \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c) and 423.2264(c), the MCMG prohibited many of these activities, such as holding marketing events following an educational event, distributing SOA cards, and setting up future individual marketing appointments. Since the January 2021 final rule, CMS\u2019 review of marketing to beneficiaries has expanded. We have reviewed complaints about confusing and misleading marketing tactics received through 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE and have heard from industry groups concerned about the changes in our policy regarding educational events. Since the 2021 final rule, complaints to CMS have increased alleging unsolicited contact.

Section 1851(j)(1) of the Act prohibits sales and marketing to take place at educational events. Such events are meant to provide information on how Medicare works including the options of Original Medicare, Medigap plans, Part C, and Part D. These events are aimed \nat informing beneficiaries on what Medicare covers and the different options a beneficiary has when they are Medicare-eligible or are looking at the options they have to switch the way they receive their Medicare benefits. In other words, these events are meant to provide generic information about the different options, rather than to persuade beneficiaries to enroll in any type of plan (for example, MA\u2013PD or Medigap) or in a plan offered by any specific sponsoring organization. \nAlthough the collection of beneficiary \ninformation through SOAs or BRCs was previously permitted, we now believe that collection of contact information at educational events should not be permitted. As mentioned in our May 2022 final rule, the number of marketing complaints has increased significantly over the past few years. Specifically, a significant portion of these complaints involve unsolicited contact. A likely contributor to these contacts is a beneficiary not realizing the contact form provides permission to be called by an agent at some time in the future. CMS has also heard from beneficiary groups requesting that CMS reinstitute the beneficiary protections from the MCMG that were not included in the January 2021 final rule regarding educational events. \nThe beneficiary attends an \neducational event to learn about Medicare, unlike a sales event where a beneficiary has decided that they want to look further into a plan to enroll. Collecting contact information at educational events potentially unduly pressures a beneficiary into providing their personal information. Agents passing out SOA cards, possibly watching beneficiaries fill them out, and then collecting these cards can put a beneficiary in an uncomfortable position of having to decide whether they want to oblige or draw attention by declining. This especially may be the case if the beneficiary feels like they should provide this information in exchange for attending the educational event, which could include the provision of a meal and helpful question and answer opportunities in addition to general information. We believe the beneficiary needs to be in charge of and control whether they want to be contacted, by whom, and in what form. Therefore, to ensure such decisions remain with the beneficiary, we propose to amending the regulations that list the activities that are permissible to include in educational events (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(1)(ii) and \n423.2264(c)(1)(ii)) by removing the paragraphs that authorizes obtaining \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "599e9d52-c853-48ae-8784-98b75f6cef6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "599e9d52-c853-48ae-8784-98b75f6cef6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "add9f32f-9afb-4e9f-9193-db315e8cb516", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c1ea1c049baa20074b0c836422e87ee0dc9b8aa169c72553c949371aa2df1872"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e60caec-0f16-4317-89c8-e0bf0a97b52a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0463763daa0b2c6f3d6f376a9d14dd45fc769d9f75f60a5d76fcc79310dea56b"}}, "hash": "de7dfe7cad8277391ac90f891fae14a561f8e580b4bd7c70216bb013d35e58ce", "text": "79530 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nbeneficiary contact information, \nincluding Scope of Appointment forms. \nThe current regulations at \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(1)(ii)(C) and 423.2264(c)(1)(ii)(C) also permit agents to set up future personal marketing appointments at educational events. Similar to SOAs and contact information, we believe that beneficiaries should be in charge of with whom they speak, when they meet with an agent, and what products they want to discuss with that agent. In the case of educational events, the beneficiary generally attends the event to learn about Medicare, not to facilitate a sales meeting where the beneficiary is urged to enroll in a plan. Once an agent speaks with a beneficiary at an educational event, the beneficiary may feel pressured into setting up a marketing appointment. The \u2018\u2018on the spot\u2019\u2019 request at an educational event does not provide the beneficiary enough time to consider whether they want an someone to come to their home and market a plan to them for the purpose of enrollment. We believe that an educational event should be solely for education; not lead generation or future marketing opportunities for agents. Therefore, we also propose removing \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(1)(ii)(C) and 423.2264(c)(1)(ii)(C), which currently permit organizations and agents to set up future marketing appointments at educational events. \nCMS is also concerned about \nmarketing events directly following an educational event. As stated above, educational events are meant to provide information on how Medicare works, including the options of Original Medicare, Medigap plans, Part C, and Part D, not meant to persuade beneficiaries to enroll in a plan. Beneficiaries attending an educational event directly followed by a marketing event may feel pressured into staying for the marketing event at the conclusion of the educational event. For example, an agent may hold an educational event providing free meals and desserts, which is directly followed by a marketing event. Beneficiaries may feel pressured into staying for the marketing event because of the offer of a free meal at the event that follows the educational event. Although our current regulations require there be an opportunity to leave prior to the sales event, we do not regulate how long that needs to be, nor do we prescribe what the agent can or cannot say regarding the sales event. Beneficiaries may feel obligated to stay for a variety of reasons, including not having enough time to gather their \nbelongings or feeling awkward leaving when others are staying, adding additional pressure to stay and possibly \nenroll in an MA or Part D plan, especially when they only came to the event to learn about Medicare and the options available to them. Furthermore, attending a marketing event right after an educational event may raise the risk of beneficiaries being confused that the benefits of an MA or Part D plan in general are actually unique to the specific plan options that are being marketed. For example, a factual and impartial statement like, \u2018\u2018It is important to consider your out-of-pocket costs and which drugs you take when deciding on your enrollment options\u2019\u2019 in the educational event could be followed up in the marketing event that uses the same phrasing and terms in describing a specific plan\u2019s benefits. The beneficiary might conflate these issues if the educational and marketing meetings are held so close in time. \nWhen CMS permitted marketing \nevents to immediately follow educational events, we were concerned about beneficiaries having to go to two separate events at different times, potentially in two different places. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the use of technology. The COVID\u201319 pandemic resulted in fewer face-to-face communications and more technology- based marketing, such as Zoom calls and live events on the internet. If a beneficiary attends an educational event and wants further information about a specific MA or Part D product, the beneficiary can go to a marketing event or ask for a one-on-one appointment either in person or through communications technology. Although there are still many beneficiaries that may not have significant knowledge about digital technology, we believe the number of beneficiaries that understand the technological options will increase. The use of technology has provided more options for beneficiaries, and with the increase in technology education CMS is proposing, the need for sales events to follow educational events because of travel considerations will become less important. \nBy separating educational events from \nthe marketing events, beneficiaries are afforded the time to consider all their questions and options. The beneficiary can reach out to the agent if and when they want to hear more about the particular plan the agent is selling.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e60caec-0f16-4317-89c8-e0bf0a97b52a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e60caec-0f16-4317-89c8-e0bf0a97b52a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "add9f32f-9afb-4e9f-9193-db315e8cb516", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c1ea1c049baa20074b0c836422e87ee0dc9b8aa169c72553c949371aa2df1872"}, "2": {"node_id": "599e9d52-c853-48ae-8784-98b75f6cef6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "de7dfe7cad8277391ac90f891fae14a561f8e580b4bd7c70216bb013d35e58ce"}}, "hash": "0463763daa0b2c6f3d6f376a9d14dd45fc769d9f75f60a5d76fcc79310dea56b", "text": "CMS believes this proposal to separate marketing from educational events will alleviate the pressure a beneficiary may feel to stay for a marketing event and will protect beneficiaries from undue \npressures to enroll in a plan for which they may not be interested or a plan that does not best meet their health care needs. Based on this, we are proposing to prohibit marketing events from taking place within 12 hours of the educational event in the same location. We are proposing changes to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(2)(i) and 423.2264(c)(2)(i) to read, \u2018\u2018Marketing events are prohibited from taking place within 12 (twelve) hours of an educational event, in the same location. The same location is defined as the entire building or adjacent buildings.\u2019\u2019 We believe a 12- hour window is important to ensure beneficiaries are not pressured into attending a sales event. This will usually give beneficiaries until the next calendar day, providing sufficient time to think about the impartial and factual information provided at the educational event. We are concerned that a short window, such as 10\u201315 minutes, will not provide beneficiaries with enough time to finish conversations, pack their belongings, and leave the facility prior to the sales event starting. If a beneficiary is unable to leave during the break, we are concerned that the beneficiary may be \u2018\u2018guided\u2019\u2019 to the sales event or pressured into attending by being told the event won\u2019t last long or that there will be no pressure to join, or will be made to feel obligated to go to the sales event. CMS believes the best way to protect beneficiaries by being pressured into attendance would be for the sales event to be at a different time, with a sufficient amount of time between the two events. We also believe it is necessary to limit this new requirement to when the sales event is in the same location as the educational event. This ensures that an agent or broker can hold a sales event the same day as an educational event, provided the sales event is in a different location. If an agent wishes to have a sales event three miles from an educational event, we do not want to limit the ability of the agent or broker to do so. Therefore, we are proposing to revise paragraph (c)(2)(1)(1) of \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264 and 423.2264 to prohibit marketing events from taking place within 12 hours of an educational event, at the same location. \nSections 1851(j)(2)(A) and 1860D\u2013 \n4(l)(2) of the Act require an advance agreement with a prospective enrollee on the scope of the marketing appointment, which must be documented. Our regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(3)(i) and 423.2264(c)(3)(i) reiterate this requirement, designating this requirement as a Scope of Appointment. Both the statute and the regulations require an advance agreement between the beneficiary and the agent.

We propose codifying our previous marketing (MCMG) guidance by prohibiting personal marketing appointments from taking place until after 48 hours have passed since the time the SOA was completed by the beneficiary. However, we are not proposing to include \u2018\u2018when practicable\u2019\u2019 in the proposed regulation. We believe \u2018\u2018when practicable\u2019\u2019 nullifies the purpose of the 48 hour timeframe, given the many reasons that might be cited for why waiting the full 48 hours is not \u2018\u2018practicable,\u2019\u2019 such as the beneficiary living an hour away, the beneficiary wanting to discuss the products immediately following the signing of the SOA, the beneficiary may feel pressured by the agent to discuss the product immediately, or the beneficiary needs to arrange to have the person that helps them with health care decisions available at the meeting. The reasons for why a meeting must occur within the 48 hour timeframe are numerous and subjective, meaning what is practicable for one person may not be practicable for another, thus we are concerned about our ability to enforce the regulation if we include \u2018\u2018when practicable\u2019\u2019 in requiring advance agreement at least 48 hours before the meeting. In addition, given today\u2019s technology and the fact that we permit SOAs to be completed via telephone, electronically, or in paper form, obtaining a SOA 48 hours prior to the appointment should not present a significant burden for either beneficiaries or the plan representatives and agents that engage in these meetings.

Sections \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g)(1) and 423.2274(g)(1) require that MA organizations/Part D sponsors ensure TPMOs acting on their behalf adhere to any requirements that apply to the plan itself. Therefore, the requirement for noting the scope of a personal marketing appointment (that is, the SOA) is \napplicable to TPMOs. Currently, CMS requires permission to be granted and completed, concerning the products that will be discussed, prior to the marketing discussion. The existing regulations do not stipulate a timeframe in which the beneficiary may be contacted after an SOA is completed or an expiration date after which the SOA is invalid. \nCMS also is aware that MA \norganizations, Part D sponsors and TPMOs encourage beneficiaries to fill out business reply cards (BRC) or similar mechanisms so the MA organization/Part D sponsor or TPMO has permission to contact the beneficiary at a later date. BRCs are different from SOAs in that the SOA must have the products to be discussed on the document, while many times the BRC is simply obtaining contact information (that is, name, phone number, address, email). While SOAs are required, BRCs are not required. However, we have the same concerns with BRCs as we do with SOAs, BRCs often are open-ended, allowing an MA organization, Part D sponsor or TPMO to contact a beneficiary at any point in the future. For example, a beneficiary could fill out a BRC in October of 1 year and be contacted by the MA organization/ Part D sponsor or TPMO 24 months later, well beyond the timeframe that the beneficiary would reasonably expect to be contacted about their plan choices and decision-making when they filled out the card.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f653ea82-1a66-4d12-8ae4-c901af3d4c5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f653ea82-1a66-4d12-8ae4-c901af3d4c5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54e8822a-1380-4400-a7ac-eea9943e3deb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3eba863280fe7b8d81f5667d8daa2054f80a085321ef9239f5dbcc7cbbd10d0b"}, "2": {"node_id": "11e70872-7c98-4b66-9cbd-7c4a854eaa80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b5bdf3d9b4a86616642174e027fb6eb3f04894dfd9a19a5f2faa14cc1566e6f6"}}, "hash": "f955a47c4f54a7fe632746fc7e8064fa6931ad3757468ed873ea034df373a71d", "text": "CMS is proposing to modify the \ncurrent regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(3)(iii)(A), 422.2264(c)(3)(iii)(B), 423.2264(c)(3)(iii)(A) and 423.2264(c)(3)(iii)(B) to limit the validity of the SOAs and BRCs in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(3)(iii)(A) and 423.2264(c)(3)(iii)(A), and the SOAs in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(c)(3)(iii)(B) and 423.2264(c)(3)(iii)(B), to six months from the beneficiary\u2019s signature date or the beneficiary\u2019s request for more information. BRCs and requests for additional information are not applicable to paragraph (B) because CMS does not have the authority to regulate how long a BRC is valid for non-MA/Part D products. A beneficiary\u2019s permission to allow contact by an MA organization/Part D sponsor or a TPMO is not, and should not be, open-ended. Beneficiaries who request information regarding MA organizations/Part D sponsors are requesting information at that present time. Since the purpose of the SOA or BRC is for beneficiaries to discuss plan \nproducts applicable for the present or following contract year, having the SOA or BRC expire after 6 months satisfies \nthat purpose, and would prevent agents from using it in perpetuity and thus avoiding the statutory and regulatory prohibitions on unsolicited contact and cold calling. If a beneficiary wants the agent tied to the SOA or BRC to continue contacting them beyond 6 months, the agent may secure and document that permission through a new SOA, BRC, or similar mechanism. \nIn accordance with \u00a7 422.2265(b)(4), \nMA organizations are required to have a searchable provider directory on their website.

We believe this proposal is necessary to assist beneficiaries in finding particular providers. For example, if an organization only provides a beneficiary with the ability to search by location, the beneficiary would have significant difficulties finding a particular specialty or a particular provider. In section III.A.3. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to add two new requirements to \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i) that organizations must include providers\u2019 cultural and linguistic capabilities and identify certain providers waived to treat patients with MOUD in their provider directories. As adopted and with our proposed revisions, \u00a7 422.111(b)(3)(i) requires organizations to include these two new elements in their provider directories, therefore, our proposed modification to \u00a7 422.2265(b)(4) would require the organization\u2019s provider directory be searchable by these two new elements. By requiring website provider directories be searchable by every element, our proposal would ensure that a beneficiary would be able to locate specific provider specialties, as well as providers by names, addresses, or other elements the organization has listed in the online provider directory. Therefore, we propose to modify \u00a7 422.2265(b)(4) to require the directory be searchable by every element. \nCMS is also proposing to modify the \npre-enrollment checklist (PECL) requirements at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(4) and 423.2267(e)(4).

It ensures beneficiaries understand important documents and what information is in such documents, such as the Evidence of Coverage, which provides all costs, benefits, and plan coverage. The PECL also includes information designed to help beneficiaries, such as a reminder to make sure their doctors, pharmacies, and prescriptions are either in the plan\u2019s network or covered in their formulary. Finally, the existing PECL reminds beneficiaries of certain plan rules, formularies, and out-of-network services are not covered except for emergency and urgently needed care, and that benefits and costs may change on January 1 of each year. \nIn \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(4)(viii) and \n423.2267(e)(4)(viii), we propose to add \u2018\u2018Effect on current coverage\u2019\u2019 to the list of information that must be referenced as part of the PECL. Over the past 2 years, CMS has been doing an in-depth review of 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE complaints. Our reviews revealed numerous beneficiary complaints that they were not aware their current coverage, such as an existing MA plan, a Medigap plan, or their Tri-care plan would end once they enrolled in an MA plan. Thus, CMS is proposing to add effect on current coverage to the list of information that plans must provide to prospective enrollees in the PECL, as we believe it will provide additional education to beneficiaries on the implications of choosing an MA or Part D plan and ensure beneficiaries are fully aware that this selection will cause their existing coverage to end. \nIn \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(4) and \n423.2267(e)(4), we are also proposing that the PECL be reviewed with the prospective enrollee during telephonic enrollments as well as provided when hard-copy enrollment forms are provided. As previously mentioned, the PECL provides information necessary for beneficiaries to understand the details of the plan for which they are enrolling. Although the PECL must be provided with an enrollment form, \nCMS\u2019 review of telephonic enrollments revealed that the neither the PECL nor its substance was being conveyed to beneficiaries during the enrollment process. Specifically, complaints received by 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE included beneficiaries who called 1\u2013800\u2013 MEDICARE to inform the Agency via the toll-free line that agents failed to inform the beneficiary that their doctors \nwere not in the MA plan\u2019s network, were inaccurately told that there would be no costs, or were inappropriately told that their existing coverage would not be affected by enrolling into a new MA or Part D plan. During CMS\u2019 review of the telephonic enrollment audio recordings between beneficiaries and agents, it was clear that some beneficiaries were confused that their current coverage would be ending. It also was clear that some were misled by the agent and were told that their existing benefits would not change, and others were never informed by the agent that enrollment into an MA or Part D plan would cancel the beneficiary\u2019s current coverage. There also were cases where the agent failed to go over the beneficiary\u2019s current providers or Part D drugs. In addition, few, if any, calls with agents included explanations that all of the benefits and cost sharing for the plan could be found in the plan\u2019s Evidence of Coverage. \nBy requiring the PECL to be reviewed \nwith prospective enrollees as part of telephonic enrollments, we hope to ensure that beneficiaries are better informed about the details surrounding the plan for which they are enrolling. Under this proposal, MA organizations and Part D sponsors would decide whether they require their contracted agents and brokers to read the PECL in its entirety or to require that each item contained on the PECL be discussed. It is CMS\u2019 expectation that the agent ensures the beneficiary understands the items in the PECL. Agents may do this by receiving an affirmative answer to whether the prospective enrollee understands the information provided, as well as asking the prospective enrollee if she or he has any questions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8049a3ad-4f8f-4e83-9861-32643462b85e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8049a3ad-4f8f-4e83-9861-32643462b85e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c832a3f0-f39f-40b8-bc62-f725a92f8d3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3317dee7a5dfe5932a22450f2d1ac708da3892940190ee0ec62494de25d458ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5e105d7-578a-43c5-9887-e883419d90b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f59c459a1a759c58d2a7766210cf169b11722ec5005fa383941f0280cb5d934b"}}, "hash": "bcfed85087259dcad05705021ccf6246f918fddfd1b091bb141bd213e37981e0", "text": "CMS believes that an actual review of the PECL elements with prospective enrollees will decrease inaccurate information and misunderstandings, resulting in fewer 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE complaints and higher beneficiary satisfaction. \nTherefore, CMS is proposing to add \nthe reference to \u2018\u2018Effect on current coverage\u2019\u2019 to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(4)(viii) and 423.2267(e)(4)(viii) and requiring, in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(4) and 423.2267(e)(4), that the PECL be reviewed with the \nprospective enrollee during telephonic enrollments. \nCMS also is proposing a change to \n\u00a7 422.2267(e)(5)(ii)(A) to require Summary of Benefits medical benefits be listed in the top half of the first page and in the order currently listed in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(5)(ii)(A)(1) through 422.2267(e)(5)(ii)(A)(10). Currently, \u00a7 422.2267(c)(2) states that model materials, like the Summary of Benefits, must follow CMS\u2019 order of content when specified. This existing regulation permits CMS to specify the order of content presented in MA required model materials. CMS has already specified the order of information on medical benefits in the Summary of Benefits instructions, mirroring the regulatory list of medical benefits provided at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(5)(ii)(A)(1) through (10). By requiring all plans to list certain benefits in the same location and in a specified order, beneficiaries will be able to more easily compare benefits across different plans and in a more standardized way. The ability for beneficiaries to review and compare benefits across different MA Plans will assist beneficiaries in making a more informed health care choice. \nWe are also proposing a change to 42 \nCFR 422.2267(e)(10) and 423.2267(e)(13), which provides that the non-renewal notice is a model communications material through which plans must provide the information required under \u00a7\u00a7 422.506 and 423.507, respectively. Per \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(c) and 423.2267(c), model materials and content are those required materials and content created by CMS as an example of how to convey beneficiary information. Modifications to model materials, including the non- renewal notice, can be made at the MA organization\u2019s/Part D sponsor\u2019s discretion within certain limits outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(c) and 423.2267(c). Our current non-renewal document and accompanying instructions do not permit plan changes, except where noted, to the non-renewal notice. To ensure accuracy and consistency, we are proposing to update \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(10) and 423.2267(e)(13) to specify that the non-renewal notice is a \u2018\u2018standardized communications material\u2019\u2019 so that it is clear these materials must be used without modifications except where noted. This is necessary to ensure that the vital information contained in the non-renewal notice about a beneficiary\u2019s alternative healthcare options and the timing for the plan to make a selection are conveyed in a way that CMS has determined is accurate and understandable. Beneficiaries receiving the non-renewal notice are provided a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) (as per \u00a7 422.62(b)(1)) with deadlines to make new health care decisions. This notice provides beneficiaries with this information, as well as other plans available to them. As a model notice, MA organizations/Part D sponsors would be able to place this vital information anywhere in the document, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "322565b2-223f-4f11-aaf0-7aba5fbb7f25": {"__data__": {"id_": "322565b2-223f-4f11-aaf0-7aba5fbb7f25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3e98183-2bd6-4620-80c4-68fe44ad396f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "99adb13a9af4116b2708f64105e21f51ccc45fd136cbb7053804eca7a307e0a7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dbd3d28-8129-49c9-a2d6-985524a8d19b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f18473e2aafe533175117cec502b820e2c127719ad03619eba78ce3b481cfd5c"}}, "hash": "f2d352c9e21d1738c505f8569705c998e0d6a18d17aa33177e57d45d8d803262", "text": "79533 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \npotentially highlighting their other plan \noptions, instead of providing equal prominence to all health care choices. Our proposal would eliminate that possibility. \nIn the May 2022 final rule, CMS \nimplemented a Third Party Marketing Organization (TPMO) disclaimer at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41). The required disclaimer states, \u2018\u2018We do not offer every plan available in your area. Any information we provide is limited to those plans we do offer in your area. Please contact Medicare.gov or 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE to get information on all of your options.\u2019\u2019 We currently require TPMOs that represent more than one MA or Part D plan in a given service area, but do not represent all plans, to verbally convey the disclaimer within the first minute of a sales call, electronically convey the disclaimer when communicating with a beneficiary via email or online chat, or prominently display the disclaimer on their website, and to include the disclaimer on all marketing materials. We are proposing to modify this disclaimer to add State Health Insurance Programs (SHIPs) as a source of information for beneficiaries. We are also proposing that an additional disclaimer requirement, which would require all TPMOs to list names of the MA organizations or Part D sponsors with which they contract in the applicable service area. \nAlthough TPMOs may contract with \none or more MA organizations and Part D sponsors, they do not necessarily contract with all available options in a service area. When a beneficiary contacts a TPMO that does not contact with all MA organizations or Part D sponsors in a particular service area, the beneficiary may not know that the TPMO does not sell or represent all of the available options. To ensure beneficiaries in this situation are aware that other options exist, the disclaimers at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41) require TPMOs to notify the beneficiary that a complete list of plans could be obtained from 1\u2013800\u2013 MEDICARE or Medicare.gov. We are proposing to modify \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41) to provide that TPMOs in this situation also notify beneficiaries that they may contact their local SHIP for more information. SHIPs \nare another resource that beneficiaries can contact to obtain unbiased information on all available health and drug plan options. We believe adding SHIPs to this disclaimer provides beneficiaries with important and unbiased information regarding other sources of assistance. \nIn addition, CMS is proposing that \nTPMOs disclose the names of the MA organizations or Part D sponsors with \nwhich they contract. This ensures that beneficiaries are aware of all of their choices when communicating a TPMO. In CMS\u2019s review of hundreds of sales, marketing, and enrollment audio calls, CMS found over 80% of the calls only mentioned one plan option from one MA organization. The audio reviews CMS conducted also showed that agents rarely, if ever, informed the beneficiary that there were multiple plans available in the service area. Although the agent may have researched other plans on behalf of the beneficiary the agent was assisting, information about those plan options was rarely communicated to the beneficiary, and thus the beneficiary may not have known about their other options to make an informed decision about the plan that best meets the beneficiary\u2019s needs. \nCMS is proposing to revise the \nexisting TPMO disclaimer at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41) to require TPMOs that do not contract with every available MA organization or Part D sponsor in a service area to include a list the MA organizations or Part D sponsors with which they do contract in the beneficiary\u2019s service area. In addition, because the existing TPMO disclaimer at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41) does not apply to TPMOs that contract with every MA organization or Part D sponsor in a given service area, CMS is also proposing to revise \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(e)(41) and 423.2267(e)(41) to include a new disclaimer for TPMOs that do contract with every MA organization or Part D sponsor in the service area.

You can always contact Medicare.gov, 1\u2013800\u2013 \nMEDICARE, or your local State Health Insurance Program for help with plan choices.\u2019\u2019 \nWe are proposing a technical change \nto \u00a7 423.2267(e) to add new paragraphs (e)(43) and (e)(44), to include the comprehensive medication review (CMR) written summary which, in accordance with \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B), Part D sponsors must provide to all MTM program enrollees who receive a CMR, as well as the safe disposal information that, in accordance with \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(E), Part D sponsors must provide to all plan enrollees targeted for MTM. As noted in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 5984), we intended \u00a7 423.2267(e) to be a complete list of all required materials and content. The CMR written summary and safe disposal information are materials that Part D sponsors are already required to provide under existing regulations at 42 CFR 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B) and (E), and were inadvertently omitted from this section during the previous rulemaking. Because MA\u2013PDs must comply with Part D regulations per \u00a7 422.500, this proposal regarding the MTM and safe disposal instructions will also apply to MA\u2013PDs. \nBased on our review of complaints \nand audio calls, we are concerned about the level of oversight that MA organizations and Part D sponsors provide over their contracted agents and brokers. In our review of complaints and discussions with MA organizations and Part D sponsors, MA organizations and Part D sponsors appear to be reactive instead of proactive in addressing inappropriate agent and broker behavior. CMS has received complaints through 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE as well as other CMS staff. Once a complaint is received, the complaint is provided to the applicable MA organization or Part D sponsor to review, investigate, and take appropriate action. However, this method of oversight is more reactive, and requires organizations and sponsors to respond to issues that CMS has already been made aware. As a result, we are concerned that inappropriate behavior by agents and brokers is not being sufficiently addressed and corrected by MA organizations and Part \nD sponsors. In \u00a7\u00a7 422.2272 and 423.2272, we propose requiring \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca33dab0-1cb0-44a8-ab05-9322af3fe643": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca33dab0-1cb0-44a8-ab05-9322af3fe643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6302459-7a16-42f7-b11e-0e2d98828ed1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "305a45111f0a22249289ea022468344dd69f44f5f8cfbd331446992548e37ac2"}, "3": {"node_id": "2524e5db-9952-4de5-a2f9-24b9aa384fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "57a57e25530131d62f5356449b4ecc20accfa6694097a0a6572c3b5000cfb5b1"}}, "hash": "89439d6ec13441598d74ba28ccf4076aeca0ebc8da14c8fa39494b33099d31e1", "text": "79534 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nsponsoring organizations have an agent \nand broker monitoring and oversight plan that ensures agents and brokers are adhering to CMS requirements and that the MA organization or Part D sponsor is actively monitoring and reporting agents and brokers to CMS who are not compliant with CMS requirements. \nWe believe a thorough oversight and \nmonitoring plan will assist in identifying and stopping poor performing agents and brokers more quickly, whether they are independent, captive, or employed agents or brokers. To that end, CMS requires MA organizations and Part D sponsors to oversee the agent and brokers with which they contract (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(c) and 423.2274(c)). A proper oversight program includes the review of internal grievances, 1\u2013800\u2013MEDICARE complaints, random samplings of past audio calls, listening to sales/marketing/ enrollment calls in real-time, secretly shopping in-person education and sales events, and secretly shopping web- based education and sales events. These types of activities will improve the overall marketing and sales activities of plans. MA organizations and Part D sponsors should be able to identify areas where agents and brokers have not been adequately trained, agents and brokers who may not fully understand the product offerings, and agents and brokers who improperly market to beneficiaries. MA organizations and Part D sponsors can then quickly act, such as tailored training or disciplinary measures, based on the specific issues for each agent or broker. Once an MA organization or Part D sponsor identifies the non-compliance, the MA organization or Part D sponsor would then be required to report that agent or broker non-compliance to CMS. This will assist plans and sponsors in gauging the scope of marketing issues, and help plans and sponsors in developing methods to stop inappropriate agent and broker activity. Therefore, we are proposing to add a new (e) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2272 and 423.2272 to read, \u2018\u2018Establish and implement an oversight plan that monitors agent and broker activities, identifies non- compliance with CMS requirements, and reports non-compliance to CMS.\u2019\u2019 \nSection 1856(b) of the Act provides \nCMS the authority to publish regulations creating standards for organizations to carry out the MA program. CMS is proposing to adopt, at a new paragraph (c)(12) of \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274 and 423.2274, additional standards for agents and brokers in their marketing of MA and Part D plans to beneficiaries to \nrequire that sponsoring organizations ensure that agents and brokers discuss specific topics and information with beneficiaries prior to enrollment. We believe that adopting these standards is consistent with and achieves a similar goal as the statutory requirement in section 1851(j)(2)(D) of the Act that compensation to agents and brokers create incentives for agents and brokers to enroll beneficiaries in the plan that best meets their health care needs. For an agent or broker to ensure the beneficiary is in a plan that best meets their needs, the agent or broker needs to obtain enough information to determine the health care needs of the beneficiary. If the agent or broker fails to have sufficient information to ensure that he or she is enrolling the beneficiary in a plan that best meets the beneficiary\u2019s health care needs, but is compensated for enrolling the beneficiary in a plan, we believe that section 1851(j)(2)(D) of the Act is undermined. CMS is concerned that agents and brokers too often fail to adequately determine the kind of health plan into which a beneficiary wishes to enroll, such as a plan that offers a lower premium and higher copays, one that has specific providers in their network, or one that provides coverage for a certain durable medical equipment. Therefore, in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(c) and 423.2274(c), we are proposing that all agents and brokers (employed, captive, and independent agents) go through a CMS-developed list of items that must be asked and/or discussed during the marketing and sale of an MA plan or Part D plan. \nCMS has listened to hundreds of \nmarketing and enrollment audio calls. In the majority of these calls (over 80 percent), agents and brokers failed to ask pertinent questions to help a beneficiary enroll in a plan that best meets his or her needs. CMS listened to calls where the agent or broker only asked about primary care providers and prescription drugs. There were also calls that CMS listened to where the agent or broker only discussed \u2018\u2018extra benefits\u2019\u2019 such as dental and vision.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2524e5db-9952-4de5-a2f9-24b9aa384fc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2524e5db-9952-4de5-a2f9-24b9aa384fc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6302459-7a16-42f7-b11e-0e2d98828ed1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "305a45111f0a22249289ea022468344dd69f44f5f8cfbd331446992548e37ac2"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca33dab0-1cb0-44a8-ab05-9322af3fe643", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "89439d6ec13441598d74ba28ccf4076aeca0ebc8da14c8fa39494b33099d31e1"}}, "hash": "57a57e25530131d62f5356449b4ecc20accfa6694097a0a6572c3b5000cfb5b1", "text": "During many of the calls CMS reviewed, the agent or broker failed to ask important questions, such as whether there was a specialist that the beneficiary wished to see (or currently sees) and whether that specialist was in the plan\u2019s network, whether the beneficiary would prefer lower copays and a higher premium or vice versa, which hospitals the beneficiary preferred, or whether the beneficiary wanted dental and hearing benefits. Some calls were under twenty (20) minutes in length. This short time period led CMS to question whether an agent or broker could have realistically obtained the necessary information from the beneficiary in order to adequately \ndetermine their needs and wants, review available options, and complete the enrollment. \nIn order to properly assist a \nbeneficiary in choosing a Medicare health and/or drug plan, the agent or broker must have sufficient information about the beneficiary\u2019s needs and goals. We do not believe a beneficiary can be enrolled in a plan that best meets his or her needs when, for example, an agent or broker fails to ask the beneficiary about their current providers, including specialists and preferred hospitals or other facilities. To ensure a beneficiary\u2019s needs are reviewed, CMS is proposing to add a new (12) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(c) and 423.2274(c), requiring an MA organization or Part D sponsor ensure that the agent\u2019s/broker\u2019s sales call goes over each CMS required question or topic, including information regarding primary care providers and specialists (that is, whether or not the beneficiary\u2019s current providers are in the plan\u2019s network), prescription drug coverage and costs (including whether or not the beneficiary\u2019s current prescriptions are covered), costs of health care services, premiums, benefits, and specific health care needs. CMS would provide in sub- regulatory guidance more detailed questions and areas to be covered based on these general topics. \nIf agents and brokers are required to \nask beneficiaries certain questions, or cover certain topics, prior to beginning the enrollment process, we expect that beneficiaries will be more knowledgeable about the plans that are available to them, and thus better able to make an informed choice. We are not proposing that agents or brokers would be required to read standardized questions or statements regarding the topics discussed here. Rather, we are proposing that certain required topics are addressed, prior to the enrollment, whether it be asking questions about the medications the beneficiary takes or covering topics such as the premium the beneficiary will be charged for the plan. We propose to add a new (12) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(c) and 423.2274(c) which will read, \u2018\u2018Ensure, prior to an enrollment, CMS\u2019 required questions and topics regarding beneficiary needs in a health plan choice are fully discussed.

Topics include information regarding pharmacies (that is, whether or not the beneficiary\u2019s current pharmacy is in the plan\u2019s network), prescription drug coverage and costs (including whether or not the beneficiary\u2019s current prescriptions are covered), premiums, and other services (such as over-the- counter medications and other incentives).\u2019\u2019 \nCurrently in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g)(2)(ii) and \n423.2274(g)(2)(ii), TPMOs must record all calls with beneficiaries. This regulation was put into effect to ensure that TPMOs, including agents and brokers, were appropriately marketing to beneficiaries. As stated above, CMS\u2019s experience with reviewing complaints and in listening to recorded calls revealed many instances where agents and brokers have failed to provide enough information, confused beneficiaries, and, most concerning, provided inaccurate information about plan benefits. In other cases, these entities led beneficiaries to believe the beneficiaries were calling Medicare rather than an insurance agent. This requirement for recording all calls with beneficiaries was proposed on January 6, 2022, and finalized in the May 2022 final rule; we had received few pertinent comments prior to the rule being finalized. However, following this rule, CMS has heard from trade organizations, plans, as well as individual agents regarding the obligation to record all calls. Many of these post-final rule questions and comments centered around whether \u2018\u2018smaller\u2019\u2019 agent companies had to record conversations. Some of the comments received after the final rule requested clarification on whether all calls really needed to be recorded. \nCMS is not proposing to change the \nrequirement that TPMOs, including agents and brokers, regardless of their size, must record calls. However, we are proposing to limit calls that must be recorded from all calls to only those calls regarding sales, marketing, and enrollment. CMS believes the current requirement is too broad because under the current requirement calls placed to merely set up an in-person meeting, make sure the beneficiary received the plan welcome packet, or ask non- marketing questions, such as when the plan will be effective, must all be recorded. We believe this is an unnecessary burden since our goal is to obtain call recordings to ensure the \nmarketing, sales, and enrollment activities conducted by agents, brokers and TPMOs meet the applicable \nregulatory requirements. Therefore, we are proposing to modify \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g)(2)(ii) and 423.2274(g)(2)(ii) to limit the calls that must be recorded to the complete duration of marketing, sales, and enrollment calls. The definition of marketing in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2260 and 423.2260 will apply to new paragraph (g)(2)(ii) and we intend the words \u2018\u2018sales\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018enrollment\u2019\u2019 to include the plain meaning of those terms. \nIn addition to modifying \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g)(2)(ii) and 423.2274(g)(2)(ii) to only require marketing, sales, and enrollment calls to be recorded, we are also proposing to add language to clarify the platform(s) of calls which much be recorded. Since implementing the May 2022 final rule, we have received questions asking whether technology-based meetings (for example, Zoom meetings) need to be recorded. CMS considers meetings taking place on Zoom, Facetime, Skype, or other technology-based platforms to be the same as telephonic calls with the same concerns as telephonic calls. Technology is changing the way people interact and Medicare beneficiaries aging into the program are more likely to have experienced newer technologies and may be more comfortable using technology. In addition, during the COVID\u201319 pandemic, many beneficiaries learned to use different technologies to keep in touch with people. Moreover, because of the pandemic, many agents and brokers have moved to using these newer technologies, holding meetings through web-based technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e03f031f-4cbd-46eb-8a92-44d830750069": {"__data__": {"id_": "e03f031f-4cbd-46eb-8a92-44d830750069", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a648d8c3-8320-4950-a146-8c9a0943814a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4f2b0716f2b1a5f400594a26775f464196faa19cecb3106443c4dc0307f4c45d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d930e0e8-d3d0-476b-b8ad-4f4ca20f98e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "67b06dba0bd96d0a04343492ec468b3d3e562dd74e5496c0b68106b3070dd303"}}, "hash": "19f7d7ddee295d0b48b843462d0c5ba6a27a8376882420c774c061c25fa1604b", "text": "Based on the reasons stated above, we \npropose to modify \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g)(2)(ii) and 423.2274(g)(2)(ii) to read \u2018\u2018Record all marketing, sales, and enrollment calls, including calls occurring via web- based technology, in their entirety.\u2019\u2019 \nFinally, in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g) and \n423,2274(g), we are proposing to add a new paragraph (4) to address issues with TPMOs distributing beneficiary contact information to multiple entities, in any manner, including selling this information. When a beneficiary calls a 1\u2013800 number from a direct mail flyer, a television advertisement, or an internet advertisement, the beneficiary most likely believes they are only \ncalling\u2014and requesting contact with\u2014 the entity that answers the call. However, some of these entities, in quickly read disclaimers or through disclaimers in very small print, that actually inform the beneficiary that their information may be sold to other entities. The contact information (name, address, phone number) obtained by these entities is then sold to one or more field marketing organizations and/or agents/brokers. In turn, these other entities then call the beneficiary, using the initial incoming call and the contact information obtained by the TPMO from that incoming call, as a form of permission to reach out and contact the beneficiary. \nWhen a beneficiary calls a company \nbased on an advertisement, CMS asserts that the beneficiary is only expecting to connect with that particular company, not to have return calls made to their personal home or cell number from other companies. Through environmental scanning efforts, however, CMS has learned that the selling and reselling of beneficiary contact information is happening as described here and that beneficiaries are unaware that by placing the call or clicking on the web-link they are unwittingly agreeing for their contact information to be collected and sold to other entities and providing consent for future marketing activities. \nWe do not believe beneficiaries \nknowingly give their permission to receive multiple calls from multiple different entities on the basis of a single call made by a beneficiary. We believe beneficiaries intend in these scenarios that their information will be received only by one entity, that being the plan that will ultimately receive the beneficiary\u2019s enrollment request. Additionally, providing a quickly-read disclaimer or providing a disclaimer in very small print or in an inconspicuous place when that disclaimer indicates that a beneficiary\u2019s contact information may be provided or sold to another party, are considered misleading marketing tactics because these entities are using beneficiary data and contact information in a manner in which the beneficiary did not intend. Organizations that require the beneficiary to agree to allowing their contact information to be resold prior to speaking with a representative or having access to any information are another example of this. In these situations, a beneficiary initiates contact with one organization and then ends up receiving calls from multiple other unrelated entities. In light of the statutory prohibition on unsolicited contact (\u00a7\u00a7 1851(j)(1)(A) and 1860D\u201304(l)(1)), and the regulatory interpretation of that prohibition (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2264(a)(3) and 423.2264(a)(3)), this practice goes beyond the scope of what we consider permissible. Therefore, we are proposing to add a new (4) to \u00a7\u00a7 422.2274(g) and 423.2274(g) to read, \u2018\u2018Personal beneficiary data collected by \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc56e4b0-a2fc-4894-9c4a-ae74f4e483b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc56e4b0-a2fc-4894-9c4a-ae74f4e483b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbdf6c1e-7d53-43ef-b46d-3b48062cc001", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e725a95573bf4c1e927c6805af191f64575f2387215435c90ba27250084dbbd7"}, "3": {"node_id": "12af50fe-f6c4-4829-840b-155e1c99b354", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6c7597d12a707a40f590dec82764600f33bed8f9bf5c8efd8d639797cac66291"}}, "hash": "2f936df0fc8f0f9ff8894bcbe03eb21b0622ad624ba69c46d057073d177a3aed", "text": "79536 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n112Section 1860D\u20134 of the Act on beneficiary \nprotections for qualified prescription drug coverage \nincludes requirements for beneficiary access such as the development and application of formularies.

Section III.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule includes our proposal to permit Part D sponsors that meet certain requirements to immediately substitute a new interchangeable biological product for its corresponding reference product; a new unbranded biological product for its corresponding brand name biological product; or a new authorized generic for its corresponding brand name equivalent. Section III.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule also includes a proposal for a third category of negative formulary changes defined as immediate negative formulary changes. \nCurrently, we exempt Part D sponsors \nthat make immediate generic substitutions under the regulation from providing transition supplies; we now propose in section III.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule to exempt Part D sponsors making any immediate negative formulary changes (that is, all types of immediate substitutions and also market withdrawals) from providing transition supplies. We also propose to conform our regulations to provide that the same timing rules would apply for all immediate negative formulary changes, that is they all could take place at any time. \nSection III.Q.3. of this proposed rule \nproposes to align our regulatory requirements for appropriate advance notice of formulary changes to guidance and longstanding operations, including streamlining certain requirements. 2. Approval of Changes to Approved Formularies \na. Background: Statutes, Regulations, \nand Longstanding Operational Implementation of Changes to Approved Formularies \nSection 1860D\u201311(e)(2) of the Act \nprovides that the Secretary may only approve Part D plans if certain requirements are met, including the provision of qualified prescription drug coverage.\n112Section 1860D\u201311(e)(2)(D) \nof the Act specifically predicates approval on a finding by the Secretary that plan design, including formulary and tiered formulary structure, is not likely to substantially discourage enrollment by certain Part D eligible individuals. Section 1860D\u20134(c)(1)(A) of the Act calls for \u2018\u2018a cost-effective drug utilization management program, including incentives to reduce costs when medically appropriate.\u2019\u2019\n113 \nWe have taken a number of steps to \nimplement the approval process. For instance, under \u00a7 423.272(b)(2)(i), CMS does not approve a bid for which the plan design and benefits (including any formulary and tiered formulary structure) or utilization management program are likely to substantially discourage enrollment by certain individuals.

For example, \u00a7 423.120(b)(1) requires Part D sponsors to establish pharmacy and therapeutic committees to develop and review formularies as specified, and \u00a7 423.120(b)(2) requires provision of an adequate formulary. \nEach year we undertake a multi-step \nprocess to review and approve all formularies submitted by Part D sponsors as part of their annual bid packages. We review each formulary, and associated utilization management tools, to ensure that they do not discourage enrollment by beneficiaries with certain types of disease states. We do this by utilizing formulary review checks such as: provision of drugs across different classes and categories per \u00a7\u00a7 423.120(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) and 423.272(b)(2); consistency with best practice formularies currently in widespread use; clinical merit per \n\u00a7 423.120(b)(1)(v); and treatment guidelines for disease states in \u00a7 423.120(b)(2)(iii). As part of the process, we reach out to Part D sponsors when necessary to provide an opportunity to address any issues identified during our review prior to final approval. \nThe statute contemplates changes to \napproved formularies: section 1860D\u2013 4(b)(3)(E) of the Act specifies that Part D sponsors may remove a covered Part D drug or change its preferred or tiered cost-sharing status after providing appropriate notice. We understand that the statute does not contemplate a static formulary. Prescription drug therapies are constantly evolving, and new drug availability, medical knowledge, evidence-based clinical guidelines, and opportunities for improving safety and quality in prescription drug use at a lower cost will inevitably occur over the course of the year. \nRealizing that implementing new \ndevelopments may require formulary changes, we support formulary changes that would allow enrollees to quickly benefit from the latest clinical research, new potentially lower-cost options, or possibly result in better health outcomes. For instance, \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iii) permits Part D sponsors to immediately remove drugs from their formularies when Food & Drug Administration (FDA) deems them unsafe and drug manufacturers remove them from the market. Similarly, \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iv) permits a Part D sponsor that adds an equivalent generic drug, and otherwise meets requirements, to immediately remove a brand name drug or change its preferred or tiered cost-sharing status. In addition, in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2019 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-Service, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the April 16, 2018 Federal Register (hereinafter referred to as the April 2018 final rule), we reduced the time for advance direct notice of certain formulary changes from 60 to 30 days. \nThat said, as discussed at section \nIII.M. of this proposed rule, midyear changes to the Part D benefit can violate \nuniformity and undermine the integrity of bids. And despite the statute\u2019s contemplation of changes in the tiered or preferred cost sharing status of a specific drug, which accords with the goal of providing an opportunity for Part D sponsors to respond to new information specific to a particular drug by making changes that could result in \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0986e0d-c565-49d7-b181-af3226070770": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0986e0d-c565-49d7-b181-af3226070770", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c2e4de2-9a6c-4b70-ba94-56043ccaebba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d66233fb41bb23c565ea3dffb87a45ffc2c958646e493147014f03bdb3099c5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ed55dd5-6aba-424b-a376-c8d754c48aa7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b311a74c3b1e9a5318fab5e1da43c14b67bb3bf29b59ca320aa275ec33a1b9c1"}}, "hash": "8b37309d81c98d427849b8cf5b7b7e658d8f3b81424f494f974022d9e552afcd", "text": "79537 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n114Section 423.120(b)(6) exempts \n\u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iii) and (iv), which permit Part D \nsponsors to immediately remove drugs deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn by their manufacturers or make immediate generic substitutions as specified. better treatment for enrollees, the statute \ndoes not contemplate allowing plans to make large scale changes to their formularies after they have undergone the robust approval process described above. Permitting large scale formulary changes midyear could lead to \u2018\u2018bait and switch\u2019\u2019 concerns. During open enrollment, beneficiaries decide whether to enroll (or remain) in particular plans based on the benefit, including drugs offered on the formulary and tier placement, and as represented to them by the Part D sponsor. Formulary stability is extremely important so that enrollees maintain access to the benefit they chose. Moving too often from one drug to a different drug for non-clinical reasons could also pose undue threats to enrollee health. Indeed, the current regulation, \u00a7 423.120(b)(6), prohibits Part D sponsors from removing drugs or making changes to preferred or tiered cost-sharing status between open enrollment up through the first 60 days of the contract year except as specified.\n114 \nTo balance the need for a rigorously \nvetted, stable formulary against the need to permit formulary changes that respond to developments such as new drug therapies and knowledge, we have, since the start of the program, permitted certain drug-specific changes to approved formularies. \nOur process for reviewing and \napproving changes to approved formularies can be broken out into several categories, each of which is subject to a different level of CMS review and/or approval. Consistent with existing Chapter 6 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual (PDBM), we are proposing to codify our process for review and approval of changes to approved formularies. \nb. Proposed Provisions for Approval of \nFormulary Changes \nIn this rule, we propose to define \nseveral types of formulary changes, adopt rules for CMS approval of negative formulary changes, revise requirements for implementation of certain formulary changes that may be made immediately, and update and streamline our notice requirements. As part of this proposal, we are proposing organizational changes to the existing regulations to streamline them and improve their clarity. (1) Proposed Definitions \nIn our existing guidance in PDBM \nChapter 6, we use the term \u2018\u2018negative formulary change\u2019\u2019 and categorize negative formulary changes as either \u2018\u2018maintenance\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018non-maintenance.\u2019\u2019 Our policies with respect to the form of sponsor submission, means of CMS approval, and which individuals are considered to be affected by an approved formulary change differ as between \u2018\u2018maintenance\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018non- maintenance\u2019\u2019 negative formulary changes. We now propose to codify our existing policy with respect to negative changes to approved formularies, including when and how notice must be provided to \u2018\u2018affected enrollees.\u2019\u2019 \nIn \u00a7 423.100 we propose to define \nnegative formulary changes as the following changes with respect to a Part D drug: (1) removing the drug from a formulary; (2) moving the drug to a higher cost-sharing tier; or (3) adding or making more restrictive prior authorization (PA), step therapy (ST), or quantity limits (QL) requirements for the drug. We would note that QL restrictions would not include safety edits described at \u00a7 423.153(c)(2) to prevent unsafe or inappropriate dosing of drugs. CMS does not require such edits to be submitted to CMS as part of the formulary. Accordingly, we propose that negative formulary changes do not include safety-based claim edits which are not submitted to CMS.

Maintenance changes are changes generally expected to pose a minimal risk of disrupting drug therapy or are warranted to address safety concerns or administrative needs (for example, drug availability such as shortages and determining appropriate payment such as coverage under Part B \nor Part D). In our experience the vast majority of negative formulary changes are \u2018\u2018maintenance\u2019\u2019 changes that CMS routinely approves, and the vast majority of maintenance changes are generic substitutions, in which the Part D sponsor removes a brand name drug and adds its generic equivalent. \nConsistent with our current manual \npolicy and operations, we propose at \u00a7 423.100 to define \u2018\u2018maintenance changes\u2019\u2019 to mean the following negative formulary changes: (1) making any negative formulary changes to a drug and at the same time adding a corresponding drug at the same or lower cost-sharing tier and with the same or less restrictive PA, ST, or QL requirements (other than those meeting the requirements of immediate substitutions currently permitted and that we propose to permit below); (2) removing a non-Part D drug; (3) adding or making more restrictive PA, ST, or QL requirements based upon a new FDA-mandated boxed warning; (4) removing a drug deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from sale by the manufacturer if the Part D sponsor chooses not to treat it as an immediate negative formulary change; (5) removing a drug based on long-term shortage and market availability; (6) making negative formulary changes based upon new clinical guidelines or information or to promote safe utilization; or (7) adding PA to help determine Part B versus Part D coverage. We additionally intend through the use of the plural tense to clarify that Part D sponsors may request to apply more than one negative formulary change simultaneously to that drug. \nNon-maintenance changes, which are \ninfrequently warranted, are negative formulary changes that limit access to a specific drug without implementing a corresponding offset (such as adding an equivalent drug) or addressing safety or administrative needs. We propose to define \u2018\u2018non-maintenance change\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.100 to mean a negative formulary change that is not a maintenance change or (as discussed in the next paragraph) an immediate negative formulary change. \nTo these two longstanding categories \nof negative formulary changes, maintenance and non-maintenance, we \nwould introduce in \u00a7 423.100 a third category to capture negative formulary changes that fall within certain parameters and that may be made immediately. We propose to define \u2018\u2018immediate negative formulary changes\u2019\u2019 as those which meet the requirements as either an immediate substitution or market withdrawal \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f31083f2-2b11-4ce2-a8bd-dee96f8a029e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f31083f2-2b11-4ce2-a8bd-dee96f8a029e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "729590e0-1b0e-4157-9566-c014e1a76306", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f139d8c6f0640cb3a092c85e88dda3bd933f1e59930d40a2fe8a8a66b5ed46ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfb25d39-223f-42c2-adf6-3437c4806fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6c9fe68aa7dd9cabe6fc93e8b3286afb08113eb0b94ad800d03b7f154c299719"}}, "hash": "d89d966f8878e8c71efd687fee4d3afdd2f624567a2681dc9b436e5f4be25017", "text": "79538 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n115See FDA website entitled \u2018\u2018FDA List of \nAuthorized Generic Drugs\u2019\u2019 at: https://www.fda.gov/ \ndrugs/abbreviated-new-drug-application-anda/fda- list-authorized-generic-drugs#:\u223c:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Cauthorized%20generic%E2%80%9D%20drug,product%20as%20the%20branded%20product.

We note, however, that while such changes may be made immediately, Part D sponsors retain the option to implement such changes as maintenance changes. This means, those Part D sponsors that can meet all applicable requirements would have a choice as to whether to make such changes immediately and thereafter provide notice of specific changes or submit a negative change request and provide specific notice of such changes 30 days before they occur. \nTo effectuate our proposal, discussed \nin section III.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule, to permit certain immediate substitutions in the case of authorized generics, interchangeable biological products, and unbranded biological products, we propose to define \u2018\u2018corresponding drug\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 423.100 to mean, respectively, a generic or authorized generic of a brand name drug, an interchangeable biological product of a reference biological product, or an unbranded biological product of a biological product. \nFinally, we propose to move our \ncurrent regulatory description of \u2018\u2018other specified entities\u2019\u2019 currently in \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(i) to be a standalone definition of the term in \u00a7 423.100 that lists State Pharmaceutical Assistant Programs (SPAPs), entities providing other prescription drug coverage, prescribers, network pharmacies, and pharmacists as specified. \n(2) Proposed Approval and \nImplementation of Maintenance and \nNon-Maintenance Changes \nWe propose to codify our existing \npractice with respect to CMS review and approval of negative formulary changes. Specifically, we propose in \u00a7 423.120(e) that Part D sponsors may not make any negative formulary changes to the CMS- approved formulary except as specified in the regulation. We would maintain our existing requirements for immediate implementation of certain formulary changes for immediate substitutions and market withdrawals at \u00a7 423.120(e)(2), with some modifications, as discussed in section III.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule. \nWe propose to codify our existing \npolicy with respect to maintenance changes, which would, at proposed \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(i), permit Part D sponsors that have submitted a maintenance change request to assume that CMS has approved their negative change request if they do not hear from CMS within 30 days of submission. We propose to codify our existing policy with respect to non-maintenance changes as well, which would specify at \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(ii) that Part D sponsors \nmust not implement non-maintenance changes until they receive notice of approval from CMS. We also propose to codify our longstanding policy that affected enrollees are exempt from approved non-maintenance changes for the remainder of the contract year at \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(ii). \nAs discussed further in section \nIII.Q.2.b.(3). of this proposed rule, we also propose revisions to our current requirement at \u00a7 423.120(b)(6), which prohibits Part D sponsors from making certain changes between the beginning of the annual election period until 60 days after the beginning of their contract year to reference negative formulary changes and to appear at \u00a7 423.120(e)(4).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfb25d39-223f-42c2-adf6-3437c4806fc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfb25d39-223f-42c2-adf6-3437c4806fc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "729590e0-1b0e-4157-9566-c014e1a76306", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f139d8c6f0640cb3a092c85e88dda3bd933f1e59930d40a2fe8a8a66b5ed46ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "f31083f2-2b11-4ce2-a8bd-dee96f8a029e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d89d966f8878e8c71efd687fee4d3afdd2f624567a2681dc9b436e5f4be25017"}}, "hash": "6c9fe68aa7dd9cabe6fc93e8b3286afb08113eb0b94ad800d03b7f154c299719", "text": "(3) Immediate Negative Formulary \nChanges \nUnder current regulations at \n\u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iv), a Part D sponsor meeting certain requirements can add a new equivalent generic drug to its formulary and immediately remove a brand name drug or change its preferred or tiered cost-sharing and then provide retrospective direct notice to affected enrollees. Such generic substitutions are exempt from the transition process under \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(i)(B) and are not subject to the limitation on when formulary changes may take place under \u00a7 423.120(b)(6). In addition, under current regulations at \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iii), Part D sponsors can immediately remove drugs deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from sale by their manufacturers. As a matter of operations, CMS has most recently not required Part D sponsors to submit negative change requests for immediate generic substitutions. (Instances of drugs removed when FDA deems them unsafe or a drug manufacturer withdraws them from sale are infrequent.) \nOur current immediate generic \nsubstitutions policy has generated the \nquestion of whether Part D sponsors can immediately substitute drugs in other circumstances, such as substituting an authorized generic for its brand name equivalent. A central goal of our formulary policy is to provide flexibility to Part D sponsors to substitute a drug when such substitution poses minimal risk to disrupting an enrollee\u2019s drug therapy. For this reason, we are proposing in this rule to broaden the scope of permitted immediate substitutions so that Part D plans can make such substitutions not only in the case of a generic equivalent, but also in the case of authorized generics and for certain biological products. We propose to permit immediate substitution of authorized generics for the brand name \nproduct under the same terms that are currently permitted for generic equivalents. By generic equivalents, we mean drugs approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in accordance with section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that are therapeutically equivalent to a brand name drug. Authorized generics, as defined in section 505(t)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, are marketed under their corresponding brand name drug\u2019s New Drug Application (NDA)\n115 \nand are the exact same drug product as their corresponding brand name drugs. We therefore propose to revise the \nregulation to define an authorized generic drug at \u00a7 423.4 and to include the immediate substitution of authorized generics at \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i). \nWhen we first adopted the immediate \nsubstitution policy, we stated that the regulation would not apply to biological products, but that we would reconsider the issue when interchangeable biological products became available in Part D. At the time of this writing, there is at least one interchangeable biological product\n116and there is also an \nunbranded biological product marketed under the same license. Other licensed interchangeable biological products may become available in Part D in the future. Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate to expand our policy to include interchangeable and unbranded biological products when immediate substitution would not disrupt existing therapy.

Key to our decision to permit such substitutions was the fact that the rule would apply only to therapeutically equivalent generics of the affected brand name drug because such generics are the same as an existing approved brand-name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, and quality. Congress defined \u2018\u2018interchangeable\u2019\u2019 in reference to biological products, stating that interchangeable biological products \u2018\u2018may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care professional who prescribed the reference product.\u2019\u2019\n117FDA noted \non a web page for consumers that this is similar to how generic drugs are routinely substituted for brand name drugs.\n118 \nAll 50 states now permit or require \nsubstitution of interchangeable biological products for prescribed biological products when available, subject to varying requirements regarding patient and prescriber notice, documentation of the substitution, and patient savings as a result of the substitution, among other safeguards.\n119 \nIn the context of a growing market for interchangeable biological products, to follow the lead of FDA in encouraging uptake of these products, and to provide flexibility that could to lead to better management of the Part D benefit that does not impede State pharmacy practices, we propose at \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i) to permit Part D sponsors meeting the applicable requirements to immediately substitute a reference biological product on its formulary with the corresponding interchangeable biological product. In support of that proposal, we also propose the following definitions at \u00a7 423.4: An \u2018\u2018interchangeable biological product\u2019\u2019 would mean a product licensed under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)) that FDA has determined to be interchangeable with a reference product in accordance with sections 351(i)(3) and 351(k)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.\u00a7 262(i)(3) and 262(k)(4)).\n120A \u2018\u2018biological \nproduct\u2019\u2019 would mean a product \nlicensed under section 351 of the PHSA and a \u2018\u2018reference biological product\u2019\u2019 would mean a product as defined in section 351(i)(4) of the PHSA. \nIn addition to interchangeable \nbiological products, unbranded biological products have recently become available.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7e4a76-7e1f-451e-a451-2b1412b92ec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "df7e4a76-7e1f-451e-a451-2b1412b92ec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9b8bf03-dbdf-4afc-ad06-c56864d6cb0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8e6309c8463853a2b5dc77994316133fe7ecba6713f9a59e0d612e8c6bc6a573"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4894a06-e8ca-4f14-9b78-5bdeac0076d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e6c272d26b479e4140627105aafa01859a799efbad22b5ff71424966078854ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "10908ea4-4100-48bc-8595-7c7e88cbb886", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "830d9c52b81c992ce26df0ec9f471196b82c450d39343de2f89c05974811a75d"}}, "hash": "75d695067d9938e44b03d9eac790745fda9a50da6a14b7529472206e5ba3d5b0", "text": "In addition to interchangeable \nbiological products, unbranded biological products have recently become available.

Nevertheless, we encourage Part D plan sponsors to offer more biosimilar \nproducts on their formularies. \nTo reflect the fact that this regulation \nas proposed would then permit immediate switches for more types of drugs than generic drugs, we propose to refer to all of these changes as \n\u2018\u2018immediate substitutions\u2019\u2019 rather than \u2018\u2018immediate generic substitutions,\u2019\u2019 and drugs eligible to be immediately substituted as \u2018\u2018corresponding drugs\u2019\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 423.4. \nAdditionally, through use of the \nplural tense (\u2018\u2018negative formulary changes\u2019\u2019), we intend in our proposed description of immediate substitutions in \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i) to make clear that a Part D sponsor that otherwise meets our requirements that adds a corresponding drug and chooses to retain, rather than remove, the drug currently on its formulary may apply more than one negative formulary change to that drug (for instance, add an interchangeable biologic product to the formulary and both move the reference product currently on the formulary to a higher cost-sharing tier and add prior authorization requirements). \nOur proposal would exempt negative \nimmediate changes that meet our requirements from the negative change request and approval process discussed earlier in III.Q.2., but would require Part D sponsors to submit such changes in their next required or scheduled CMS formulary updates. We also propose to renumber \u00a7 423.120(b)(6) to appear at \u00a7 423.120(e)(4). That section currently requires that, other than immediate generic substitutions or instances in which a plan removes a drug deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from sale by a manufacturer, Part D sponsors cannot remove a covered Part D drug from its formulary or make any change in the preferred or tiered cost-sharing status of a formulary drug between the beginning of the annual election period until 60 days after the beginning of their contract year. We propose to revise this provision to refer to negative formulary changes and exempt all immediate negative formulary changes\u2014be they immediate substitutions or market withdrawals. \nAs noted earlier, the current \nregulation exempts Part D sponsors that make immediate generic substitutions from the regulatory requirement to provide transition supplies. The regulations do not specify that such an exemption exists for drugs deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from sale by their manufacturers. We now propose to include market withdrawals as well as all types of immediate substitutions: \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(i)(B) would exempt Part D sponsors making any immediate negative formulary changes from providing transition supplies of such affected drugs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10908ea4-4100-48bc-8595-7c7e88cbb886": {"__data__": {"id_": "10908ea4-4100-48bc-8595-7c7e88cbb886", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9b8bf03-dbdf-4afc-ad06-c56864d6cb0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8e6309c8463853a2b5dc77994316133fe7ecba6713f9a59e0d612e8c6bc6a573"}, "2": {"node_id": "df7e4a76-7e1f-451e-a451-2b1412b92ec7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "75d695067d9938e44b03d9eac790745fda9a50da6a14b7529472206e5ba3d5b0"}}, "hash": "830d9c52b81c992ce26df0ec9f471196b82c450d39343de2f89c05974811a75d", "text": "VerDate Sep<11>2014 23:56 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "589d39d1-a1d8-4ff2-80a7-5f3f8c3c9f0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "589d39d1-a1d8-4ff2-80a7-5f3f8c3c9f0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e80ce8b3-5627-43b5-abaa-6a2eb1f5ea42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "39ea08b7170f8c9009756cad8f652902dcb1f9d56b5fc4ef5645deff23c583c9"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f87f34e-e014-47d0-bc72-4750c107dfce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "25a8253bef1381702bf4c657c6dacab5daf2ec1564d776c3762ab9e94e1fc36b"}}, "hash": "ec690ca737f67ca2276fd24c28137ea8a7b49311b83e5743050f04f33c2c0be2", "text": "79540 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n(4) Relation to Inflation Reduction Act \nof 2022 \nSection 11001 of the IRA amended \nsection 1860D\u20134(b)(3)(I)(i) of Act to require the inclusion on a plan\u2019s formulary of selected drugs for which a maximum fair price is in effect with respect to the plan year. Section 1860D\u2013 4(b)(3)(I)(ii) of the Act specifies that nothing in clause (i) shall be construed as prohibiting a Part D sponsor from removing such a selected drug from a formulary if such removal would be permitted under \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iv) or any successor regulation. We propose to identify \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i) as the successor regulation to \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iv) for purposes of section 1860D\u20134(b)(3)(I)(ii) of the Act. \n3. Notice Requirements \na. Background: Statutes, Regulations, \nand Guidance on Notice of Changes \nSection 1860D\u20134(b)(3)(E) of the Act \nrequires Part D sponsors to provide \u2018\u2018appropriate notice\u2019\u2019 to the Secretary, affected enrollees, physicians, pharmacies, and pharmacists before removing a Part D drug from a formulary or changing the preferred or tiered cost- sharing status of such a drug. We implemented this statute in regulations issued at the start of the program in the January 2005 Part D final rule and updated in the April 2018 final rule. We consider various forms of advance notice to be appropriate in different situations, and in some cases our current regulations reflect these distinctions, such as in the case of permitted immediate generic substitutions (which we propose earlier to broaden to include other substitutions of corresponding drugs), where advance general notice is appropriate so long as direct notice is provided at a later time. \nIn this section of the proposed rule, \nwe are proposing various changes to update and streamline the requirements that apply to the provision of notice of formulary changes and to propose revised requirements for appropriate advance notice of such changes. These proposals will bring our regulations into better alignment with our longstanding practice as reflected in PDBM Chapter 6. \nb. Alignment of Approval and Notice \nPolicy \nWe propose a series of changes to our \nnotice requirements, both to reorganize and streamline them, as well as to provide for faster implementation of all formulary changes (other than negative formulary changes), such as moving a drug to a lower cost-sharing tier or making a utilization management tool \nless restrictive. \nFirst, we propose in \u00a7 423.120(f)(1) to \nspecify that only maintenance and non- maintenance negative formulary changes would require 30 days\u2019 advance notice to CMS and other specified entities, and in writing to affected enrollees. We are also proposing to retain at \u00a7 423.120(f)(1) an alternative option for Part D sponsors to provide an affected enrollee who requests a refill an approved month\u2019s supply of the Part D drug under the same terms as previously allowed, as well as written notice of the change. We further propose in \u00a7 423.120(f)(5)(i) to require Part D sponsors to provide advance general notice of other formulary changes to all current and prospective enrollees and other specified entities, in formulary and other applicable beneficiary communication materials advising that the formulary may change subject to CMS requirements; providing information about how to access the plan\u2019s online formulary and contact the plan; and stating that the written notice of any change made when provided would describe the specific drugs involved. For immediate substitutions, we would require information on the steps that enrollees may take to request coverage determinations and exceptions. Our current model documents already largely provide advance general notice of such changes. Section 423.120(f)(5)(ii) as proposed would further state that Part D sponsors provide enrollees and other specified entities notice of specific formulary changes by complying with \u00a7\u00a7 423.128(d)(2) and provide CMS with notice of specific changes through formulary updates. \nWe propose to revise and renumber \nthe existing regulation to specify that, except for negative immediate changes, negative formulary changes require at least 30 days advance notice. Consistent with our proposal for approval of maintenance changes, a Part D sponsor could submit the negative change request, which would constitute its notice to CMS, and notice to other specified entities at the same time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f87f34e-e014-47d0-bc72-4750c107dfce": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f87f34e-e014-47d0-bc72-4750c107dfce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e80ce8b3-5627-43b5-abaa-6a2eb1f5ea42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "39ea08b7170f8c9009756cad8f652902dcb1f9d56b5fc4ef5645deff23c583c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "589d39d1-a1d8-4ff2-80a7-5f3f8c3c9f0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ec690ca737f67ca2276fd24c28137ea8a7b49311b83e5743050f04f33c2c0be2"}}, "hash": "25a8253bef1381702bf4c657c6dacab5daf2ec1564d776c3762ab9e94e1fc36b", "text": "This would permit the Part D sponsor to implement the maintenance change once it is deemed approved under \nproposed \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(i)\u2014although facing the risk of sending notice of a change that is subsequently disapproved by CMS. \nPart D sponsors currently submit \nnegative change requests to CMS via HPMS that specify the negative change\u2019s intended effective date, which under our proposed approach, would have to be at least 30 days after submission for a maintenance change. However, \nconsistent with our proposal under \u00a7 423.120(f)(3)(ii) to prohibit Part D sponsors from implementing non- maintenance changes until they receive notice of approval from CMS, Part D sponsors would not be permitted to provide notice to other specified entities or affected enrollees, or to otherwise update formularies or other materials, until CMS has approved the non- maintenance change. \nWe propose to update \n\u00a7 423.128(d)(2)(iii), to require online notice of negative formulary changes. As we observed in our April 2018 final rule (83 FR 1607 and 1608), online postings that are otherwise consistent with our requirements for notice to \u2018\u2018other specified entities (currently described in \u00a7 423.120(b)(5) and, as discussed in section II.W.2.b.(1). of this proposed rule, proposed to be defined in \u00a7 423.100) may constitute sufficient notice of formulary changes. Consistent with this observation and that \u00a7 423.128(d)(2)(ii) requires an online formulary to be updated monthly, our proposed revisions would clarify that the requirement to provide notice to other specified entities is satisfied by the Part D sponsor\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 423.128(d)(2). \nAs suggested in PDBM, Chapter 6, \n\u00a7 30.3.4.2, sponsors may elect to provide other specified entities an annual notice providing information on the sponsor\u2019s formulary change policy (that is, timing of notice, methods of communication \nwith beneficiaries, and any electronic notices providers may receive at the point-of-sale regarding formulary status) and the sponsor\u2019s website where these entities can verify the formulary status of particular drugs. \nc. Notice of Negative Immediate \nChanges \nConsistent with our existing \nrequirements for immediate generic substitutions (which we propose above to broaden to include other corresponding drugs), we propose to require advance general notice of immediate substitutions and market withdrawals at \u00a7 423.120(f)(2), followed by written notice to affected enrollees as soon as possible under \u00a7 423.120(f)(3), but by no later than the end of the month following any month in which a change takes effect. \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.120(f)(4) to \nmaintain our current requirements for the contents of the direct written notice, but reorganize and renumber them for clarity. We also propose to revise the regulation at \u00a7 423.120(f)(4)(iv) to require information on appropriate alternative drugs that treat the same \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22d28fe9-c87a-4bba-a818-f79d43c16d23": {"__data__": {"id_": "22d28fe9-c87a-4bba-a818-f79d43c16d23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93642f83-2890-4403-befa-9591e764112a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8c023ee099dafb72fb7c1204887166fb72df253791da63ef6975f3af1a9e8a90"}, "3": {"node_id": "b415205d-3321-4f4e-a4b8-3d6927ab5d90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b0ba9ef56334d46ff833c5875b0511253dd66a114de055b9da32848f3773ea8a"}}, "hash": "b77046f5bad09c9000be84d0568a33eb6aa05038a090217bc44ec15593f1df8b", "text": "79541 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \ncondition in the same or a lower cost- \nsharing tier in addition to retaining the long standing requirement for information on expected cost-sharing. We are providing more flexibility by removing the requirement that the alternative drugs must be in the same therapeutic category or class: while alternative drugs are likely to be, they might not necessarily be in the same therapeutic category or class based on a plan\u2019s classification system. Therefore, we are increasing flexibility with the understanding the Part D sponsor\u2019s P&T committee would identify clinically appropriate formulary alternatives at the time the formulary change is being evaluated. \nWe further propose that the contents \nof the written notice would be the same regardless of when the notice must be provided. That is, for notices of maintenance and non-maintenance changes, which must be provided to affected enrollees at least 30 days in advance per \u00a7 423.120(f)(1), and for notices of negative immediate changes, which can be provided after the changes take effect per \u00a7 423.120(f)(3), the content of the written notice would remain largely the same. Consistent with existing requirements, the notice proposed in \u00a7 423.120(f)(4) would contain the name of the affected drug, the type of negative formulary change being made and why, alternatives and expected cost sharing, and for immediate substitutions, how an affected enrollee can obtain a coverage determination or exception. \nLastly, we propose to make \nconforming amendments to cross citations in \u00a7\u00a7 423.104(d)(2)(iv)(A)(6) and 423.128(e)(6) as applicable that we have moved the bulk of our discussion on changes to the formulary from \u00a7 423.120(b)(5) and (6) to \u00a7 423.120(e) \nand (f). \n4. Conclusion \nWe would like to take this \nopportunity to note that sections \n\u00a7\u00a7 423.2265(c)(1)(v) and 423.2265(c)(1)(ii) respectively require Part D sponsors each year to provide a Formulary to current enrollees along with an Annual Notice of Change, for which the model language instructs enrollees to review the drug list to confirm continued coverage for their drug. However, while we do not require plans to identify specific formulary changes impacting enrollees for the next contract year, several years of experience have shown that educating beneficiaries about formulary changes helps reduce beneficiary confusion and complaints at the start of the plan year. We encourage plans, particularly those with significant formulary or benefits \nchanges due to PBM transition, plan crosswalks, contract consolidations, or other reasons to engage in beneficiary education and outreach regarding formulary changes. \nIn the process of proposing the \nregulatory changes described in this section, we realized that the burden associated with these policies was not accurately captured in PRA package CMS\u201310141. This package attributed a number of hours for each plan to provide notice to CMS and other entities for removal of drugs from the Part D formulary, however, the package did not properly estimate burden at the level of granularity associated with the complete scope of negative changes, negative change requests, or providing notice to affected enrollees. In section VII.B.6. of this proposed rule, we describe burden associated with our policies related to negative formulary changes as we propose to codify them. We note that while we make this correction to the PRA package, we believe that Part D sponsors have been following the guidance provided in PDBM chapter 6 and annual formulary operations memoranda. CMS monitors negative change request submission and changes to HPMS formularies as a matter of standard operations, and we have received few complaints from beneficiaries stating they have been subject to formulary changes without proper notice. Thus, we believe that Part D sponsors have been complying with the enrollee notice component of current policy. The model notice letter for enrollees affected by negative formulary changes will be included with the associated updates to PRA package CMS\u201310141. With respect to impact of the current policy to the Medicare Trust Fund, Part D sponsors have been able to make negative changes to their formularies, subject to CMS guidance and oversight, since the start of the Part D program. We therefore assume that there is no net impact to the Medicare Trust Fund as a result of codifying existing policy related to negative formulary changes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b415205d-3321-4f4e-a4b8-3d6927ab5d90": {"__data__": {"id_": "b415205d-3321-4f4e-a4b8-3d6927ab5d90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93642f83-2890-4403-befa-9591e764112a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8c023ee099dafb72fb7c1204887166fb72df253791da63ef6975f3af1a9e8a90"}, "2": {"node_id": "22d28fe9-c87a-4bba-a818-f79d43c16d23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b77046f5bad09c9000be84d0568a33eb6aa05038a090217bc44ec15593f1df8b"}}, "hash": "b0ba9ef56334d46ff833c5875b0511253dd66a114de055b9da32848f3773ea8a", "text": "We also assume there is no net impact to the Medicare Trust Fund as a result of the proposed policy permitting immediate substitution of new interchangeable biological products; unbranded biological products; and authorized generics since when the initial immediate substitution policy was adopted, there was no net impact expected, as discussed in the April 2018 final rule. \nIn summary, we propose regulatory \nchanges on how to obtain approval to \nmake changes to a formulary already approved by CMS and to provide notice of such changes. In regards to approval, we propose to codify, with some revisions, longstanding sub-regulatory guidance and terminology specifying when and how Part D sponsors can obtain approval to make negative formulary changes and the enrollees to whom these changes would apply. Specifically, we propose to codify our existing practice with respect to CMS review and approval of negative formulary changes by proposing in \u00a7 423.120(e) that Part D sponsors may not make any negative formulary changes to the CMS-approved formulary except as specified in the regulation. We would codify longstanding policy at proposed \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(i), to permit each Part D sponsor that has submitted a maintenance change request to assume that CMS has approved its negative change request if it does not hear back from CMS within 30 days of submission, and at \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(ii) to specify that that Part D sponsors must not implement any non-maintenance changes until they receive notice of approval from CMS. We also propose to codify our longstanding policy that affected enrollees are exempt from approved non-maintenance changes for the remainder of the contract year at \u00a7 423.120(e)(3)(i). \nIn support thereof, we would define \n\u2018\u2018negative formulary changes\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 423.100 to Part D drugs to include drug removals, moves to higher cost- sharing tiers, and adding or making more restrictive PA, ST, or QL requirements. We would specify that negative formulary changes can be classified in one of three categories, which we also propose to define in that same section as: \n\u2022\u2018\u2018Maintenance changes,\u2019\u2019 which we \nwould define to encompass seven types of changes including drug substitutions that do not meet our requirements of immediate substitutions under \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i); changes based on particular events such as certain FDA actions, long-term shortages, and new clinical guidelines or information or to promote safe utilization; or adding PA to help determine Part B versus Part D coverage; \n\u2022\u2018\u2018Non-maintenance changes,\u2019\u2019 \nwhich we would define as negative formulary changes that are not maintenance changes or immediate negative formulary changes; or, \n\u2022\u2018\u2018Immediate negative formulary \nchanges\u2019\u2019, a newly coined term that would compass all types of immediate substitutions or market withdrawals under \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i) or (ii) respectively. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b37466b-0d36-49a4-abe6-443ee341e358": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b37466b-0d36-49a4-abe6-443ee341e358", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4259d73-913b-4f44-8909-9a2989170115", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "15dc668f5e1bfca607762603222694a992f4198487fdc80076cd26614c6b8e52"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c4475f8-7b53-4af2-b7db-b2890d14c32d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d35835b9dddafe42e8b9e75c146ae57349d02cc98dee78dcd868fbe23615b717"}}, "hash": "bcc68a6ed8371c52f70f6115721e8385de30ce7e662c009bba59fda06e68e85e", "text": "79542 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAs an exception to the general rule \nrequiring prior CMS approval of \nformulary changes, our current regulations permit immediate generic substitutions and for plans to remove drugs deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from the market. We propose to move and incorporate that regulation text as follows: In \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(i), we propose to permit what we would newly describe as immediate substitutions, which would mean Part D sponsors could immediately make generic substitutions as well as substitute a new \u2018\u2018interchangeable biological product\u2019\u2019 for its corresponding reference product; a new \u2018\u2018unbranded biological product\u2019\u2019 for its corresponding brand name biological product; and a new \u2018\u2018authorized generic\u2019\u2019 for its corresponding brand name equivalent. We would support this proposal by defining the above quoted terms in \u00a7 423.4; identifying the corresponding relationships (including the previously permitted generic substitutions) in our definition of a \u2018\u2018corresponding drug\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 423.100; and in \u00a7 423.4 also defining \u2018\u2018biological product\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018brand name biological product\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018reference biological product\u2019\u2019. In proposing in \u00a7 423.120(e)(2)(ii) to continue to permit plans to immediate remove from their formulary any Part D drugs deemed unsafe by FDA or withdrawn from sale by their manufacturer, we would newly describe these changes as \u2018\u2018market withdrawals\u2019\u2019. Under proposed \u00a7 423.120(e)(2), Part D sponsors meeting our requirements for immediate substitutions and market withdrawals would be able to make these changes immediately without submitting negative change requests to CMS but under proposed \u00a7 423.120(f)(2) and (3) would be required to provide advance general notice of such changes and to submit specific changes in their next required or scheduled CMS formulary updates. \nWe propose in respective \n\u00a7\u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(i)(B) and 423.120(e)(4) to conform our regulations to provide that the same transition and timing rules would apply for all immediate negative formulary changes: as proposed all immediate negative formulary changes could take place at any time (previously this exception only applied to immediate generic substitutions and market withdrawals) and Part D sponsors would not need to provide a transition supply therefor (previously we only specified in regulation that this exception applied to immediate generic substitutions). \nWe also propose to move to the \ncurrent regulation at \u00a7 423.120(b)(6) \nwhich prohibits Part D sponsors from making certain changes from the start of \nthe annual enrollment period to 60 days after the beginning of the contract year: We propose to revise it at \u00a7 423.120(e)(4) to specify that plans cannot make negative formulary changes during the stated time period except, as noted earlier, for immediate negative formulary changes (that is, immediate substitutions or market withdrawals). \nMiscellaneous proposed changes in \n\u00a7 423.100 in support of the above changes include updating the definition of \u2018\u2018affected enrollee\u2019\u2019 to encompass beneficiaries affected by all negative formulary changes; and moving our current regulatory description of \u2018\u2018other specified entities\u2019\u2019 from \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(1) to be a standalone definition of the term in \u00a7 423.100. \nIn regards to notice, we also propose \nto move, with some revisions and streamlining, current regulations on notice of changes, and align them to our proposed approval requirements. Specifically, in \u00a7 423.120(f)(1) we would specify that only maintenance and non- maintenance negative formulary changes require 30 days\u2019 advance notice to CMS, other specified entities, and in written form to affected enrollees. We propose to retain and move to \u00a7 423.120(f)(1) an alternative option for Part D sponsors to provide a month\u2019s supply with notice at point of sale as specified. We would move and extend our existing requirements for immediate generic substitutions to include substitutions of corresponding drugs and market withdrawals, by proposing to require advance general notice of immediate negative formulary changes at \u00a7 423.120(f)(2), followed by written retrospective notice required under \u00a7 423.120(f)(3) to affected enrollees.

Background \nSection 1860D\u20134(c) of the Act \nrequires all Part D sponsors to have an \nMTM program designed to assure, with respect to targeted beneficiaries, that covered Part D drugs are appropriately used to optimize therapeutic outcomes through improved medication use, and to reduce the risk of adverse events, including adverse drug interactions. Section 1860D\u20134(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act requires Part D sponsors to target those \nPart D enrollees who have multiple chronic diseases, are taking multiple Part D drugs, and are likely to meet a cost threshold for covered Part D drugs established by the Secretary. Since January 1, 2022, Part D sponsors are also required by section 1860D\u2013 4(c)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act to target all at-risk beneficiaries (ARBs) in their Part D drug management program (DMP) for MTM. \nIn the January 2005 Part D final rule \n(70 FR 4279 through 4283), CMS codified MTM targeting criteria at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2), without further detail on the number of chronic diseases, the number of covered Part D drugs, or the annual cost threshold that would be used to identify targeted beneficiaries. In guidance provided during the Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Program User Group Discussions on May 13, 2005 and March 15, 2006, and in the HPMS Memorandum Changes to Part D Sponsors\u2019 Medication Therapy Management Program (MTMP) dated August 29, 2006, CMS initially set the annual cost threshold at $4,000 at the start of the Part D program.

This \napproach allowed maximum flexibility for industry to develop best practices for the provision of MTM services. After gaining Part D program experience, in the final rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs,\u2019\u2019 (75 FR 19772 through 19776), which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2010, CMS revised \u00a7 423.153(d)(2) by establishing more specific targeting criteria based on an enrollee\u2019s number of chronic diseases (with 2 being the minimum, and 3 being the maximum a sponsor may require), number of covered Part D drugs (with 2 being the minimum, and 8 being the maximum a sponsor may require), and estimated annual Part D drug costs greater than or equal to $3,000 for 2011, which is then increased by the annual percentage increase (API) specified in \u00a7 423.104(d)(5)(iv) to determine the annual cost threshold for 2012 and subsequent years. With those changes, CMS sought to promote greater consistency across the Part D program and allow for better evaluation and comparison of MTM programs going forward. With the exception of adding the requirement that Part D sponsors target all ARBs in their DMP for MTM as described previously, the MTM eligibility framework has not been updated since that time. \nIn the Draft CY 2012 Call Letter (See \npage 109, available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Advance2012.pdf), we solicited comment on evaluating and addressing disparities in the MTM eligibility criteria. Subsequently, in January 2014, we issued a proposed rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs,\u2019\u2019 (79 FR 1918) in which we proposed changes to broaden the targeting criteria to 2 or more chronic diseases (with at least one being a core chronic disease), 2 or more covered Part D drugs, and average annual cost associated with taking 2 generic drugs ($620 at that time). As discussed in the subsequent final rule, which appeared in the Federal Register on May 23, 2014 (79 FR 29865 through 29867), those proposals were not finalized, primarily due to the significant number of commenters that strongly opposed the broad expansion of MTM eligibility and concerns about the potential impact on plan administrative costs, beneficiary premiums, and the quality of existing MTM programs.\n121 \nHowever, we stated that we would \ncontinue to evaluate information on MTM programs and monitor sponsors\u2019 compliance with the MTM requirements, with the goal of proposing revisions to the criteria in future rulemaking that would help to expand the program. \nMTM eligibility rates have steadily \ndeclined over time. At the start of the Part D program, CMS expected about 25 percent of the Part D population would be eligible for MTM. By 2020, MTM eligible beneficiaries had declined to just 8 percent. In conjunction with the decreasing eligibility rate, CMS has observed near-universal convergence among Part D sponsors to the most restrictive targeting criteria currently permitted under \u00a7 423.153(d)(2). When we finalized the current regulatory requirements for targeting criteria over 12 years ago, CMS elected to give plan sponsors significant flexibility in establishing their MTM eligibility criteria. However, most plans now require 3 or more chronic diseases, 8 or more Part D drugs, and target a narrow and variable list of chronic diseases. Because plans may also limit their \ntargeting criteria to certain diseases, drugs, or both, in addition to the low eligibility rates overall, enrollees with equivalent patient profiles (for example, same chronic diseases, same number of chronic diseases, same number of Part D drugs, and similar estimated drug costs) may or may not be eligible for MTM depending on the criteria their plan requires.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d0c02b3-e7dd-46e4-ab54-b842de8354fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d0c02b3-e7dd-46e4-ab54-b842de8354fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93de2698-9f7a-4311-af04-78e6385b31b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7fde28eb10c9808e3a47b1c9a429ad61df820b9b514156ca345df096433f1a04"}, "2": {"node_id": "11ad6bb6-a67f-4632-ba69-28fabbbd9878", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9ecf0103ed0925dd49f3cc4634d122b4c8af34f536797fed40e023f6e83f4fed"}}, "hash": "2d063de706295d366328ceaa34942e57d1179861f6596106bac369d25b24112b", "text": "122Under the current \nmethodology at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(C), the annual MTM cost threshold for 2023 will be $4,935, which also significantly limits the number of beneficiaries who are eligible to be targeted for MTM enrollment. \nThe high cost threshold and \nrestrictive plan criteria have significantly reduced the MTM program size over time, and Part D enrollees with more complex drug regimens who would benefit most from MTM services are often not eligible. After an extensive review of CMS and plan-reported data, CMS has identified several issues with the current MTM targeting criteria and proposes the regulatory changes discussed in the following sections in an effort to increase MTM eligibility rates, reduce variability of MTM eligibility criteria across plans, and \naddress disparities to ensure that those who would benefit the most from MTM services have access. Taken together, the proposed changes to the MTM program targeting criteria would balance eligibility and program size while allowing us to address specific problems \nidentified in the Part D MTM program, including marked variability and inequitable beneficiary access to MTM services. \nb. Multiple Chronic Diseases \nThe regulation at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(A) \nspecifies that to be targeted for MTM, \nbeneficiaries must have multiple chronic diseases, with 3 chronic diseases being the maximum number a Part D sponsor may require for targeted enrollment. In the current guidance (See HPMS Memorandum Correction to Contract Year 2022 Part D Medication Therapy Management Program Guidance and Submission Instructions dated April 30, 2021), CMS identifies 9 core chronic diseases, some of which are enumerated in the statute, including conditions that are highly prevalent in the Part D population, align with common targeting practices across sponsors, and are commonly treated with Part D drugs, where MTM services could most impact therapeutic clinical outcomes. The 9 core chronic diseases are: Alzheimer\u2019s disease; bone disease- arthritis (such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis); chronic congestive heart failure (CHF)*; diabetes*; dyslipidemia*; end-stage renal disease (ESRD); hypertension*; mental health (such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other chronic/disabling mental health conditions); and respiratory disease (such as asthma*, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic lung disorders).\n123While the \nAct specifically names congestive heart failure (CHF), we are proposing to specify only chronic CHF as a core disease. The Act also names hyperlipidemia, but we are proposing to codify dyslipidemia as a core disease to include both chronically high (hyperlipidemia) and low (hypolipidemia) lipid levels. This list of core chronic diseases aligns with longstanding MTM guidance identifying core chronic diseases and is also consistent with the discretion granted in the statute to identify chronic diseases. \nAs explained in the CMS guidance, as \npreviously cited, sponsors may target enrollees with any chronic diseases or \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbdfd5f1-8ef4-4a9c-b930-c4d644f62010": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbdfd5f1-8ef4-4a9c-b930-c4d644f62010", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3ba49003-49d6-4fe7-bbab-0c152e745504", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "093199dcf6bc4ae3a09b23f168ac3f9b5dbc230c32d4af36e4896c9846083717"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7cf99fe-5814-42b1-9395-953ad4ece50e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e0a1f540eb5bd6319b88e02830c250f2175ad0282fd8c1fd02ab05b806412275"}}, "hash": "ed286377da541c46cd201914eac61224acccacacb20604d774bf2f165c6bd152", "text": "79544 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n124Part D reporting requirements (OMB Control \nNo. 0938\u20130992). 125https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency- \nInformation/OMH/Downloads/OMH_ Dwnld- \nDataSnapshot-HIV.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/ \ngroup/hiv-idu.html. \n126Kogut SJ.

Sponsors may also offer MTM services to an expanded population of \nenrollees who do not meet the eligibility criteria for targeted enrollment under \u00a7 423.153(d)(2). \nBased on our review of 2020 plan- \nreported MTM program targeting criteria and Part D enrollment data, submitted at the contract level, 86 percent of Part D enrollees were in a plan that targeted the minimum of only 5 of the 9 core chronic diseases. In the same year, only 1 percent of the Part D population was enrolled in a plan that targeted all 9 core chronic diseases, a decrease from 3 percent in 2015. Those plans had an MTM enrollment rate of 15 percent versus the overall enrollment rate across Part D of 8 percent, based on analysis of contract year 2020 MTM plan-reported and validated beneficiary-level data.\n124 \nCombined with CMS administrative claims data, we found that a significant proportion of the Part D population that we identified as having 3 or more core chronic conditions and using 8 or more drugs (approximately 9 million beneficiaries) were not eligible to be targeted for MTM (6 million). We estimate that approximately one-third of the ineligible beneficiaries (about 2 million) were not eligible due to variations in plan-specific targeting criteria (for example, plans targeting fewer than all of the core chronic diseases or targeting specific drug classes as opposed to all or most covered Part D maintenance drugs). \nHIV/AIDS is not currently included in \nthe list of core chronic diseases. Our analysis of 2020 data, including PDE data, Parts A and B claims data, validated beneficiary-level MTM data, and other available program data, revealed that Part D enrollees with HIV/ AIDS have an average of 4 core chronic diseases (including HIV/AIDS), take 12 Part D covered drugs (including 8 maintenance drugs), and incur $40,490 in Part D annual drug spend. Many of these individuals are not eligible for MTM because their plan does not target HIV/AIDS or does not target enough of their other chronic conditions. Individuals with HIV/AIDS often have complex Part D drug regimens where medication adherence is critical, very high Part D drug costs, and multiple comorbidities, and are more likely to be members of populations affected by disparities. \n125 126 Although not \ncurrently identified as a core chronic \ndisease, HIV/AIDS is more likely to be targeted by plans (about 10 percent of plans in 2021) than any other non-core chronic disease. \nBased on our internal analyses and \npublished literature, we propose to amend the regulations at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2) by adding a new paragraph (iii) to require all Part D sponsors to include all core chronic diseases when identifying enrollees who have multiple chronic diseases, as provided under \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(A). As part of the proposed new provision at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(iii), we also propose to codify the 9 core chronic diseases currently identified in guidance and to add HIV/AIDS, for a total of 10 core chronic diseases.

We now have data showing that approximately 20 percent of enrollees who meet even the most restrictive criteria permitted (that is, have 3 or more chronic diseases, are taking 8 or more Part D drugs, and are likely to meet the cost threshold) are not eligible because almost all plans also adopt the most restrictive number of core chronic diseases to target (5 core chronic diseases). Accordingly, this proposed change aims to close this gap in access and better ensure that the beneficiaries who are most in need of MTM services are targeted for enrollment. By reducing the variability in targeting criteria across plans, we would eliminate situations where enrollees meet the requirement in \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i) of having 3 chronic diseases but are not targeted for MTM enrollment because their plan does not target their chronic diseases. This reduced variability would also allow CMS to more accurately estimate program size when calculating burden and assessing impact. \nCMS solicits comment on whether we \nshould consider including additional diseases in the core chronic diseases proposed at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(iii), including cancer to support the goals of the Cancer Moonshot.\n127We seek \ncomment on broadly including cancer as a core chronic condition or alternatively including specific cancers that are likely to be treated with covered Part D drugs such as oral chemotherapies where MTM could be leveraged to improve medication adherence and support careful monitoring. In particular, we are interested in feedback from Part D sponsors, MTM providers, and prescribers, including oncologists, on any potential implications if CMS were to include cancer as a core chronic condition as part of the MTM eligibility criteria. We are also interested in comments on the impact of including any additional core chronic diseases on specialized MTM provider training and on MTM program size. We also solicit comments on whether MTM services furnished under a Part D MTM program are an effective mechanism for management of certain diseases (for example, those with high use of Part B drugs or frequently changing medication regimens) given the statutory goals of the MTM program\u2014specifically, reducing the risk of adverse events, including adverse drug interactions, and ensuring that covered Part D drugs prescribed to targeted beneficiaries are appropriately used to optimize therapeutic outcomes through improved medication use. We will consider the comments received in developing our policies with respect to targeting of core chronic diseases for the final rule. \nc. Multiple Part D Drugs \nSection 1860D\u20134(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the \nAct requires that targeted beneficiaries \nbe taking multiple covered Part D drugs. The current regulation at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(B) specifies that 8 Part D drugs is the maximum number a Part D plan sponsor may require for targeted MTM enrollment. Under current CMS guidance (See HPMS Memorandum CY 2020 Medication Therapy Management Program Guidance and Submission Instructions dated April 5, 2019), sponsors are permitted to include either all Part D drugs, all Part D maintenance drugs, or specific drug classes. \nBased on our internal analyses and \npublished literature, we propose to amend the regulations at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2) by adding a new paragraph (iii) to require all Part D sponsors to include all \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15f8d530-699f-42a1-8009-65ac2c571a27": {"__data__": {"id_": "15f8d530-699f-42a1-8009-65ac2c571a27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14d23c39-0316-4da3-9f37-14413a361dd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e0655df5554fb0d726b3de02f21492dbf5427333a4bb66f3a65c3e38e195470f"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ee06969-c78f-4b19-8eae-fe4a410bd668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3e4aa2b098243c1cc7c3853ae81ac3d7227072441a0a112cb580434f9e779699"}}, "hash": "3ac9af7f86e19a6bd421a1b838ffbf745ebbc92d556a88ed8d8f1008e5f2d8b3", "text": "79545 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n128M.-C.

As part of this provision, we also propose to codify the 9 core chronic diseases currently identified in guidance and to add HIV/ AIDS, for a total of 10 core chronic diseases. Under this proposal, sponsors would maintain the flexibility to target beneficiaries with additional chronic diseases that are not identified as core chronic diseases, or to include all chronic diseases in their targeting criteria. In 2020, only 13 percent of Part D plans (4 percent of the Part D population) included all covered Part D drugs in their criteria, while 81 percent of plans (87 percent of the Part D population) limited their criteria to chronic/maintenance drugs, and 7 percent of plans (9 percent of the Part D population) limited their criteria to specific drug classes only. \nWe propose to revise \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(B) to decrease the maximum number of Part D drugs a sponsor may require from 8 to 5 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Published literature demonstrates increased risk of medication errors and increased MTM effectiveness for individuals taking only a few drugs. While there is no consensus definition of polypharmacy, concurrent and/or prolonged use of 5 or more drugs has been associated with significant increases in adverse events.\n128 \nDecreasing the maximum number of Part D drugs a sponsor may require from 8 to 5 would serve as a more accurate \nproxy to help ensure that the MTM program continues to focus on individuals with more complex drug regimens and increased risk of medication therapy problems, reduce potential gaps in eligibility due to utilization disparities, and take into account Part D utilization trends. While we are proposing changes to the targeting criteria with respect to the number of Part D drugs, we note that the CMR described in \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B) will continue to include review of all prescription medications, over-the- counter drugs (OTCs), herbal therapies, and dietary supplements. \nThe statutory requirement specifying \nthat MTM targeted beneficiaries have multiple chronic diseases and take multiple covered Part D drugs suggests that the focus of MTM should be Part D covered drugs for longer term use. \nMaintenance drugs are drugs that are commonly prescribed to treat a chronic disease, usually administered continuously rather than intermittently, and typically prescribed for a longer course of therapy. Beneficiaries taking maintenance medications for chronic \ndiseases may benefit most over time from the close monitoring provided by MTM required interventions, including comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) and routine targeted medication review assessments. Accordingly, we propose to add a new provision at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(iv), which would require all sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs in their targeting criteria beginning in 2024. Plans are currently able to include all maintenance drugs in their targeting criteria as an option in the MTM Submission Module in HPMS; however, CMS does not have guidance related to how maintenance drugs are identified for this purpose. To ensure consistency across the MTM program, we also propose that, for the purpose of identifying maintenance drugs, plans would be required to rely on information contained within a widely accepted, commercially or publicly available drug information database commonly used for this purpose, such as Medi-Span or First Databank, but would have the discretion to determine which one they use. Under this proposal, sponsors would no longer be allowed to target only specific Part D drug classes, but would be required to target all Part D maintenance drugs.

CMS solicits public comment on our proposed parameters for defining maintenance drugs, including potential additional sources for making such determinations. \nThese proposed changes would \nreduce variability in MTM eligibility across plans and improve access to MTM services for Medicare Part D beneficiaries at risk of medication therapy problems. Black and Hispanic individuals tend to use fewer prescription drugs and incur lower prescription drug costs than Non- Hispanic White individuals.\n129 \nConsequently, the Part D utilization- and cost-based MTM eligibility criteria, if set too high, may be an access barrier for those populations, as well as other populations with similar utilization patterns. Medically underserved individuals may benefit from MTM services to address potential medication therapy problems, including nonadherence. MTM services may also benefit underserved individuals through identification of un- or under-treated conditions, help with utilization of preventative therapy, or referral to needed health services. Furthermore, using 2020 data, including PDE data, Parts A and B claims data, validated beneficiary-level MTM data, and other available program data to look at the entire Part D population, we found that Part D enrollees overall have an average of 2 core chronic diseases (including the 9 core chronic diseases in the current guidance along with the proposed addition of HIV/AIDS), take 5 Part D maintenance drugs, and incur $3,931 in Part D annual drug spend (median is $617). The subset of Part D enrollees with at least one core chronic disease (including the 9 core chronic diseases in the current guidance along with the proposed addition of HIV/AIDS) have an average of 3 core chronic diseases, take 6 Part D maintenance drugs, and incur $4,595 in Part D annual drug spend (median is $899). \nd. Annual Cost Threshold \nSection 1860D\u20134(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the \nAct specifies that targeted beneficiaries \nfor MTM must be likely to incur annual costs for covered Part D drugs that exceed a threshold determined by CMS. The regulation at \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(C) codifies the current cost threshold methodology, which was set at costs for covered Part D drugs greater than or equal to $3,000 for 2011, increased by the annual percentage specified in \u00a7 423.104(d)(5)(iv) for each subsequent year beginning in 2012. The annual cost threshold for 2023 will be $4,935. The cost threshold has increased substantially since it was established in regulation, while the availability of lower cost generics and the generic utilization rates have also increased significantly since the Part D program began.\n130Together, these factors have \nresulted in a cost threshold that is grossly misaligned with CMS\u2019 intent and inappropriately reduces MTM eligibility among Part D enrollees who have multiple chronic conditions and are taking multiple Part D drugs. The current cost threshold is more than three times the average annual cost of 8 generic Part D drugs, which is the maximum number of Part D drugs \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae172217-2008-4b44-8845-2f185ec4afbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae172217-2008-4b44-8845-2f185ec4afbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2add0ccb-d25d-40e0-b03b-e5675b2cfee7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "63bdba95bc69fc45b700f38843cfc66b9768c3ee9826791b84eeb67c1f0772b1"}, "3": {"node_id": "a31dd055-e6f3-4e5b-aa88-b66bc4c86ec4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4f9bc39942d5210be47df4b43b42774df67f6ef4f226c1d92bbe4e5b5c1797d7"}}, "hash": "d58e6f73cbaf7dd8323735d5fca1e0aa5b3499f33cc543b7880bd543a8303fed", "text": "79546 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n131Mansoon, N., et al.

CMS has found that the increasing threshold has significantly reduced MTM eligibility rates over the program\u2019s lifetime. Using 2020 data, CMS identified approximately 9 million Part D beneficiaries with 3 or more core chronic conditions and using 8 or more \nPart D drugs, which are the most restrictive criteria CMS currently permits. Based on validated beneficiary- level plan-reported data, about one third (approximately 3 million) of those beneficiaries were eligible for MTM, and the remaining two thirds (approximately 6 million) were not. We estimate that about 65 to 70 percent (approximately 4 million) of the ineligible beneficiaries had Part D drug costs below the MTM cost threshold based on 2020 Part D PDE data, confirming that the cost threshold substantially decreases the MTM program size. \nWhen CMS initially codified the \nMTM requirements in the January 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR 4282), we noted that cost might not be the best proxy for identifying patients that could benefit most from MTM. Since that time, a robust body of published literature concludes that polypharmacy, often defined as concurrent or prolonged use of multiple drugs, increases the risk of adverse drug events. While there is no consensus definition of polypharmacy, concurrent use of 5 or more drugs is commonly cited in research studies. Although other definitions include considerations of the number of comorbid chronic disease states, drug indications, drug interactions, healthcare setting, and duration of therapy, none of these definitions include drug cost.\n131As plans continue \nto adopt the most restrictive eligibility criteria CMS permits with respect to the minimum number of chronic diseases and Part D drugs, lowering the cost threshold is especially important to help ensure MTM access for the targeted population contemplated in the statute. Based on published literature, comments from stakeholders, and extensive internal analysis of CMS data, we continue to believe that the cost threshold remains the biggest driver of reduced MTM eligibility rates. \nAccordingly, we propose to set the \nMTM cost threshold for the 2024 plan year and each subsequent plan year at the average annual cost of 5 generic \ndrugs. Based on 2020 PDE data, the annual cost of five generic drugs was approximately $1,004. Under this proposal, for 2024 and subsequent years, CMS would calculate the dollar amount of the MTM cost threshold based on the average daily cost of a generic drug using PDE data from the plan year that ended 12 months prior to the applicable plan year, which is the PDE data currently used to determine the specialty-tier cost threshold as specified in the current provision at \u00a7 423.104(d)(2)(iv)(C). For 2024, the calculation would use PDE data from 2022 to identify the average daily cost of a generic fill, multiplied by 365 days for an annual amount. The average daily cost for a drug, would be based on the ingredient cost, dispensing fees, sales tax, and vaccine administration fees, if applicable, and would include both plan paid amounts and enrollee cost sharing. As is currently the case, the MTM cost threshold will be published in the annual Part D Bidding Instructions memo. \nWhile the dollar amount would \ncontinue to be calculated annually, revising the methodology to base the cost threshold on the average cost of 5 generic drugs would considerably reduce year-to-year variability. Under the current methodology, the threshold amount has increased by an average of $140 each year since it was established in 2011. In contrast, the average annual cost of a generic drug, adjusted for days\u2019 supply, decreased slightly between 2012 and 2020. The proposed change to the cost threshold would also greatly reduce the likelihood that enrollees taking primarily lower cost generic alternatives would be excluded from MTM as a result of a prohibitively high cost \nthreshold, aligning with a pillar of the Part D program: encouraging the use of generics/lower cost drugs when medically appropriate. \nWe propose to amend the regulation \nat \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(C) to reflect this new MTM cost threshold for plans years starting in 2024 and subsequent years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a31dd055-e6f3-4e5b-aa88-b66bc4c86ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a31dd055-e6f3-4e5b-aa88-b66bc4c86ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2add0ccb-d25d-40e0-b03b-e5675b2cfee7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "63bdba95bc69fc45b700f38843cfc66b9768c3ee9826791b84eeb67c1f0772b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae172217-2008-4b44-8845-2f185ec4afbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d58e6f73cbaf7dd8323735d5fca1e0aa5b3499f33cc543b7880bd543a8303fed"}}, "hash": "4f9bc39942d5210be47df4b43b42774df67f6ef4f226c1d92bbe4e5b5c1797d7", "text": "Specifically, we propose to set the MTM cost threshold at the average cost of 5 generic drugs, as defined at \u00a7 423.4.

The revisions proposed in this section would also better align MTM eligibility criteria with the statutory goals of reducing the risk of adverse events, including adverse drug interactions, and optimizing therapeutic outcomes for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and who take multiple Part D drugs, while maintaining a reasonable cost criterion. \nIn summary, we are proposing to: \n\u2022Add a new paragraph at \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(iii) to: (1) codify the \ncurrent 9 core chronic diseases in regulation and add HIV/AIDS as a core chronic disease, for a total of 10 core chronic diseases and (2) require sponsors to include all 10 core chronic diseases in their targeting criteria; \n\u2022Revise \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(B) to lower \nthe maximum number of covered Part D drugs a sponsor may require from 8 to 5 drugs; \n\u2022Add a new paragraph at \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(iv) to require sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs when determining the number of drugs an enrollee is taking for purposes of MTM eligibility; and \n\u2022Revise \u00a7 423.153(d)(2)(i)(C) to \nchange the annual cost threshold methodology ($4,935 in 2023) to be commensurate with the average annual cost of 5 generic drugs ($1,004 in 2020). We are proposing that these changes would be applicable beginning in plan year 2024. With these proposed changes, we estimate an MTM program size of approximately 23 percent of the Part D population. Burden estimates and impacts are discussed in sections IV.X. and VIII.X. of this proposed rule, respectively. \n2.

This requirement was codified at \u00a7 423.153(d)(1) in the January 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f95e9c1a-4458-4da9-8b69-d0f9837be3d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f95e9c1a-4458-4da9-8b69-d0f9837be3d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c61409d0-eb50-41c9-90ea-ef9f756f2245", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5c180243565fd5af8c9e9ce3b2235144efe45c139cdab3791579f795cdd852a8"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae955c7b-4489-4175-9a0e-95e25759865f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7d108a1840b6e8c2e82c08739f042b3bd73d9a64e5eaf5998a05b9ba7ae74c9c"}}, "hash": "1e2fb766650453260e621cc055e541af74a41fd5cb84875fc2d583192d8e3841", "text": "79547 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n4279). CMS subsequently finalized a \nrequirement at \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B) specifying that, beginning in 2011, MTM programs must offer each MTM enrollee an annual CMR, including an interactive, person-to-person consultation performed by a pharmacist or other qualified provider unless the beneficiary is in a long-term care (LTC) setting (75 FR 19772 through 19774). We included this exemption from the requirement to offer a CMR because we recognized that many LTC residents may not be able to participate in the interactive consultation due to cognitive impairment. \nFor 2013 and subsequent plan years, \nthe Affordable Care Act (ACA) amended the Act by adding section 1860D\u2013 4(c)(2)(C)(i), which requires all Part D sponsors to offer all enrollees targeted for MTM an annual CMR. Consistent with the statutory change, CMS revised the regulation at \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B) in the April 2012 final rule (77 FR 22072) to remove the exemption for residents of LTC settings beginning in 2013. In the preamble to the final rule, we noted that the ACA provision did not provide a basis for creating an exception to the requirement to offer a CMR based on the setting of care (77 FR 22140 through 22142). However, CMS acknowledged that many LTC residents, as well as individuals in other health care settings (for example, hospice), may suffer cognitive impairments and, therefore, may not be able to participate in the CMR. Accordingly, in the same rule, we finalized a new provision at \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B)(2) to permit the CMR provider to perform the CMR with an enrollee\u2019s prescriber, caregiver, or other authorized individual if the enrollee is unable to accept the offer to participate. \nIn guidance issued annually, \nincluding our most recent HPMS guidance memorandum titled \u2018\u2018Correction to CY 2022 MTM Program Guidance and Submission Instructions\u2019\u2019 dated April 30, 2021, CMS has consistently stated that we consider a beneficiary to be unable to accept an offer to participate in the CMR only when the beneficiary is cognitively impaired and cannot make decisions regarding their medical needs. In this proposed rule, we propose to codify this definition by amending the current regulation text at \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B)(2) to specify that in order for the CMR to be performed with an individual other than the beneficiary, the beneficiary must be unable to accept the offer to participate in the CMR due to cognitive impairment. Consistent with existing CMS \nguidance, the flexibility to perform the \nCMR with an individual other than the beneficiary would not apply to situations where the sponsor is unable to reach the beneficiary (such as no response by mail, no response after one or more phone attempts, or lack of phone number or address), if there is no evidence of cognitive impairment, or the beneficiary declines the CMR offer. \nCognitive status may be determined \nusing interviews with the beneficiary or their authorized representative, caregiver, or prescriber. If the MTM provider determines a beneficiary is unable to accept the offer to participate in a CMR, and the MTM provider is unable to identify another individual who is able to participate, a CMR cannot be performed. However, sponsors are still required to provide the other required MTM services detailed in \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii). Although claims data or diagnosis codes may be used to gather information about a beneficiary\u2019s medical conditions, Part D sponsors must not rely on such administrative information alone to determine whether a beneficiary is cognitively impaired and unable to accept the offer to participate in their own CMR. \nWe continue to recommend that when \na targeted beneficiary moves to a LTC facility, Part D plan sponsors should identify the appropriate contact for each beneficiary. This contact could be the authorized representative, caregiver, or prescriber. Sponsors, or their MTM providers, could contact the admissions coordinator, Minimum Data Set (MDS) coordinator, Director of Nursing, or other appropriate facility staff person to ascertain if an authorized representative has been designated in the beneficiary\u2019s medical record or chart. Sponsors are encouraged to develop processes and procedures to contact the facility in the least burdensome manner to request assistance from the facility to identify beneficiaries who are not cognitively impaired and may be able to accept the offer to participate in their CMR, and beneficiaries who have a health care proxy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae955c7b-4489-4175-9a0e-95e25759865f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae955c7b-4489-4175-9a0e-95e25759865f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c61409d0-eb50-41c9-90ea-ef9f756f2245", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5c180243565fd5af8c9e9ce3b2235144efe45c139cdab3791579f795cdd852a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "f95e9c1a-4458-4da9-8b69-d0f9837be3d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1e2fb766650453260e621cc055e541af74a41fd5cb84875fc2d583192d8e3841"}}, "hash": "7d108a1840b6e8c2e82c08739f042b3bd73d9a64e5eaf5998a05b9ba7ae74c9c", "text": "In the event that the definition of authorized representative differs by State or in settings other than LTC, we defer to State law. \nThe change we are proposing to the \nregulatory text reflects longstanding \nCMS guidance and is also consistent with the discussion of this policy in the preamble to the April 2012 final rule (77 FR 22140). Plan sponsors have complied with this policy for several years as evidenced by CMS data analyses using plan-reported data to identify contract- level outliers regarding CMR completion rates, the CMR recipient, and cognitive impairment status of MTM program \nenrollees. As such, there is no associated paperwork burden not already accounted for and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 0938\u20131154 (CMS\u201310396). \n3. Requirement For In-Person or \nSynchronous Telehealth Consultation \nSince 2011, the regulation at \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B)(1)(i) has required that CMRs provided under a Part D sponsor\u2019s MTM program include an interactive, person-to-person, or telehealth consultation performed by a pharmacist or other qualified provider. In the preamble to both the proposed (74 FR 54693) and final rules (75 FR 19773) in which we first adopted this requirement, CMS emphasized that the consultation must be conducted in real- time, either face-to-face or via an alternative real-time method, such as the telephone. We further specified in response to public comments that plans would have the discretion to determine the method used, including emerging technologies, as long as the CMR is conducted in real-time. In MTM guidance issued annually through Call Letters and HPMS memoranda, most recently in the April 30, 2021 HPMS memorandum titled, \u2018\u2018Correction to CY 2022 MTM Program Guidance and Submission Instructions,\u2019\u2019 CMS has specified that CMRs should be performed in real-time. \nIn the 12 years since we finalized the \ncurrent regulation text, including during the COVID\u201319 public health emergency, telehealth capabilities have developed considerably and experienced significant growth. In its Best Practice Guide: Telehealth for Direct-To- Consumer Care (https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/direct-to- consumer/), HHS refers to synchronous telehealth as an interaction that occurs \nin live, real-time settings, usually via phone or video. Asynchronous telehealth, also referred to as \u2018\u2018store-and- forward,\u2019\u2019 involves communication that is sent and received at different times (for example, a patient sends photos to their doctor that the doctor reviews later). Advancements in telehealth, such as widespread use of smart phones and secure video interactions, have confounded the concept of \u2018\u2018person-to- person\u2019\u2019 interaction, which CMS\u2014in the context of the current CMR requirements in \u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B)(1)(i)\u2014intended to refer to an in-person interaction as opposed to a telehealth consultation. \nAs a result of these developments, \nCMS has identified a need to update our regulatory text. We propose to amend \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca4171bc-7949-4538-84f6-3817a81e79d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca4171bc-7949-4538-84f6-3817a81e79d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b78f448c-2675-4e3d-abea-72c5d17fdc77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ef6edb3a9874dd517dc4e20c1d3fbe702cfb4e8cf3d0d8c20a6dd0b9f0fcdae7"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb65f5ad-1133-4d26-96d9-4ce67343e59c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "26ae588ae074b56d91313b2e43712b8cb6a412f1a62d85bd84dc49d9a4229f75"}}, "hash": "c82c48e9d021be9867c750353ec5e6fa7193d501d6a50ff96b9e2a2fbd93b39e", "text": "79548 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nthe existing regulation text at \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(1)(vii)(B)(1)(i) to require that the CMR be performed either in person or via synchronous telehealth to clarify that the CMR must include an interactive consultation that is conducted in real-time, regardless of whether it is done in person or via telehealth. While the consultation must be conducted in real-time, under this proposal, plans would continue to have the discretion to determine whether the CMR can be performed in person or using the telephone, video conferencing, or another real-time method. \nThe change proposed in this section \nis consistent with our longstanding policy that the CMR be conducted in real-time as described in the original rulemaking establishing the CMR requirement and codifies existing guidance, issued annually, which plan sponsors have complied with for years. Sponsors are required to submit their MTM program parameters to CMS for review each year, and, in doing so, are required to indicate the type of interactive, person-to-person or telehealth consultation (for example, face-to-face, telephone, telehealth), and to supply a detailed description of the CMR consultation. Because this proposed change codifies existing program guidance with which plans are \nalready compliant, there is no paperwork burden associated with it. \n4. MTM Program Technical Changes \nWe are proposing several technical \nchanges to the regulation text related to \nthe Part D MTM program. At \u00a7 423.4, we propose to add a definition for \u2018\u2018MTM program\u2019\u2019 to clarify the meaning of this term as used in Part 423. In the heading for \u00a7 423.153(d), we propose to remove the dash and replace it with a period to be consistent with other paragraph headings in Subpart D. We propose to amend \u00a7 423.153(d) by striking \u2018\u2018or\u2019\u2019 from the end of existing paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C)(2) to clarify that, consistent with section 1860D\u20134(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, plan sponsors must target enrollees described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) and enrollees described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii). Throughout Part 423, Subpart D, we propose to replace \u2018\u2018MTMP\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018MTM program\u2019\u2019 to ensure that the terminology is used consistently. \nS. Standards for Electronic Prescribing \n(\u00a7 423.160) \nWe propose updates to the standards \nto be used by Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for electronic prescribing (e-prescribing). This includes: (1) after a transition period, requiring the National Council for Prescription Drug Plans (NDPDP) SCRIPT standard version 2022011 \nproposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.205(b), and retiring the current NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, as the e-prescribing standard for transmitting prescriptions and prescription-related information (including medication history and electronic prior authorization (ePA) transactions) using electronic media for covered Part D drugs for Part D eligible individuals; (2) requiring the NCPDP Real-Time Prescription Benefit (RTPB) standard version 12 proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.205(c) as the standard for prescriber real-time benefit tools (RTBTs) supported by Part D sponsors; and (3) revising current regulatory text referring to standards for eligibility transactions. \nIn this proposed rule, we propose a \nnovel approach to updating e- prescribing standards by cross- referencing Part D requirements with standards adopted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the standards adopted for electronic transactions in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations. A joint approach to adopting and updating electronic prescribing standards aims to mitigate potential compliance challenges for HHS and the healthcare industry that may result from independent adoption of such standards. \nThe NCPDP SCRIPT standards are \nused to exchange information between prescribers, dispensers, intermediaries and Medicare prescription drug plans (PDPs). The Medicare Part D statute at section 1860D\u20134(e) of the Act and regulations at \u00a7 423.160(a) require drug plans participating in the prescription benefit to support e-prescribing, as defined at \u00a7 423.159(a), and physicians and pharmacies who transmit prescriptions and related communications electronically, to utilize the adopted standards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb65f5ad-1133-4d26-96d9-4ce67343e59c": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb65f5ad-1133-4d26-96d9-4ce67343e59c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b78f448c-2675-4e3d-abea-72c5d17fdc77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ef6edb3a9874dd517dc4e20c1d3fbe702cfb4e8cf3d0d8c20a6dd0b9f0fcdae7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca4171bc-7949-4538-84f6-3817a81e79d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c82c48e9d021be9867c750353ec5e6fa7193d501d6a50ff96b9e2a2fbd93b39e"}}, "hash": "26ae588ae074b56d91313b2e43712b8cb6a412f1a62d85bd84dc49d9a4229f75", "text": "The proposed updated NCPDP SCRIPT standards have been requested by the industry and provide a number of updates that the industry and CMS support. Accordingly, we propose to update \u00a7 423.160 throughout for prescription, medication history, and \nePA transactions utilizing the NCPDP SCRIPT standard, as well as to permit an 18-month transition period beginning July 1, 2023 where either NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 or 2022011 can be used, with exclusive use of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 required by January 1, 2025. \nThe NCPDP RTPB standard enables \nthe exchange of patient eligibility, preferred pharmacy network participation status, product coverage (including any restrictions and alternatives), and associated cost sharing so prescribers have access to this information through a RTBT application that can be utilized at the point-of-prescribing. As discussed in section III.Y.2. of this proposed rule, CMS requires at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7) that Part D sponsors implement one or more electronic RTBTs that are capable of integrating with at least one prescriber\u2019s electronic prescribing system or electronic health record, as of January 1, 2021; however, at the time CMS established this requirement, no single industry RTPB standard was available. The NCPDP RTPB standard version 12 has since been developed and tested in real-world applications. We propose to require it as the standard for prescriber RTBT applications at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7) starting January 1, 2025. \nEligibility transactions utilize the \nNCPDP Telecommunication or Accredited Standards Committee X12 standard for pharmacy or other health benefits, respectively. The Part D program has adopted standards based on the HIPAA electronic transaction standards, which have not been updated for more than a decade. Pursuant to legal authority that we discuss in this rule, we propose to update the Part D regulation at \u00a7 423.160(b)(3) by adding a new paragraph (iii) indicating that eligibility transactions must utilize the applicable standard named in the HIPAA regulation at 45 CFR 162.1202, which we propose to be required beginning July 1, 2023 in 42 CFR 423.160(b)(1)(vi). Since the HIPAA regulation currently identifies the same standards that are named at \u00a7 423.160(b)(3)(i) and (ii), we anticipate no immediate impact from this proposed change in regulatory language. However, on November 9, 2022, HHS\u2019s proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Administrative Simplification: Modifications of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Retail Pharmacy Standards; and Adoption of Pharmacy Subrogation Standard,\u2019\u2019 (87 FR 67634), which proposes to adopt updated versions of the retail pharmacy standards for electronic transactions at 45 CFR 462.1202, appeared in the Federal Register. Thus, our proposal will assure Part D requirements align with the HIPAA requirements should a newer version of the NCPDP Telecommunication (or other) standards be adopted as the HIPAA standard for these types of electronic transactions as \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7266fe1-3648-405e-b336-72f543226ebd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7266fe1-3648-405e-b336-72f543226ebd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da4afd5e-ecda-44ca-a4e0-79095da7dad5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e521271047a706e7e89ad33cdf47e946e41495df943abec974c4a20ede222e6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "33819e10-9fe8-4f05-8a4a-2e3ac179555b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0a59807e353b896ecb3a4ead791533328fb3c312adf4114c7635ac2ce46fefc6"}}, "hash": "5689885cb6a7524cd5489ecdd2e08a428e18b52d2308283309c14340c271118b", "text": "79549 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \na result of the aforementioned proposed \nrule and any future HHS rules. \n1.

Part D sponsors are required to establish electronic prescription drug programs that comply with the e-prescribing standards that are adopted under this authority. For a further discussion of the statutory requirements at section 1860D\u20134(e) of the Act, refer to the proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the February 4, 2005 Federal Register (70 FR 6255). Section 6062 of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (Pub. L. 115\u2013271), hereinafter referred to as the SUPPORT Act, amended section 1860D\u20134(e)(2) of the Act to require the adoption of transaction standards for the Part D e- prescribing program to ensure secure ePA request and response transactions between prescribers and Part D plan sponsors for Part D-covered drugs prescribed to Part D-eligible individuals. There is generally no requirement that Part D prescribers or dispensers implement e-prescribing, with the exception of required electronic prescribing of Schedule II, III, IV, and V controlled substances that are Part D drugs, consistent with section 2003 of the SUPPORT Act and as specified at \u00a7 423.160(a)(5). However, prescribers and dispensers who electronically transmit and receive prescription and certain other information regarding covered drugs prescribed for Medicare \nPart D eligible beneficiaries, directly or through an intermediary, are required to comply with any applicable standards that are in effect. \n2. Regulatory History \nAs specified at \u00a7 423.160(a)(1), Part D \nplan sponsors are required to support \nthe Part D e-prescribing program transaction standards. Likewise, as specified at \u00a7 423.160(a)(2), providers and pharmacies that conduct electronic transactions for covered Part D drugs for Part D eligible individuals for which a program standard has been adopted must do so using the adopted standard. Transaction standards are periodically updated to take new knowledge, technology, and other considerations into account. As CMS adopted specific versions of the standards when it initially adopted the foundation and final e-prescribing standards, there was a need to establish a process by which the standards could be updated or replaced over time to ensure that the \nstandards did not hold back progress in the industry. CMS discussed these processes in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the November 7, 2005 Federal Register (70 FR 67579). An account of successive adoption of new and retirement of previous versions of various e-prescribing standards is described in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule, Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule & Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2014,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the December 10, 2013 Federal Register (78 FR 74229); the proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2019 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-Service, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the November 28, 2017 Federal Register (82 FR 56336); \nand the corresponding final rule (83 FR 16440), which appeared in the April 16, 2018 Federal Register. The final rule \ntitled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Secure Electronic Prior Authorization For Medicare Part D,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the December 31, 2020 Federal Register (85 FR 86824), codified the requirement that Part D sponsors support the use of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 for certain ePA transactions (85 FR 86832).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33819e10-9fe8-4f05-8a4a-2e3ac179555b": {"__data__": {"id_": "33819e10-9fe8-4f05-8a4a-2e3ac179555b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da4afd5e-ecda-44ca-a4e0-79095da7dad5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e521271047a706e7e89ad33cdf47e946e41495df943abec974c4a20ede222e6d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7266fe1-3648-405e-b336-72f543226ebd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5689885cb6a7524cd5489ecdd2e08a428e18b52d2308283309c14340c271118b"}}, "hash": "0a59807e353b896ecb3a4ead791533328fb3c312adf4114c7635ac2ce46fefc6", "text": "The final rule titled \u2018\u2018Modernizing \nPart D and Medicare Advantage To Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of- Pocket Expenses,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the May 23, 2019 Federal Register (84 FR 23832), codified at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7) the requirement that Part D sponsors adopt an electronic RTBT capable of integrating with at least one prescriber\u2019s electronic prescribing or electronic health record (EHR) system, but did not name a standard since no industry standard was available at the time. The electronic standards for eligibility transactions were codified in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Program; Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency, and Burden Reduction,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the May 16, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 29001), to align with the applicable HIPAA standards. \nThe Part D program has historically \nadopted electronic prescribing standards independently of other HHS components that may adopt electronic prescribing standards under separate authorities; however, past experience \nhas demonstrated that duplicative adoption of health IT standards by other agencies within HHS under separate \nauthorities can create significant burden on industry as well as HHS when those standards impact the same technology systems. Notably, independent adoption of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 by CMS at \u00a7 423.160 (83 FR 16638) in 2018, which required use of the standard beginning in 2020, led to a period where ONC had to exercise special enforcement discretion in its Health Information Technology (IT) Certification Program until the same version was incorporated into regulation at 45 CFR 170.205(b)(1) through the final rule titled \u2018\u201821st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the May 1, 2020 Federal Register (85 FR 25679). \nThis resulted in significant impact on both ONC and CMS program resources in order to address stakeholder concerns about misalignment. See section III.T. of this proposed rule for additional discussion of ONC\u2019s proposal and authority. Similarly, the preamble of the May 2012 final rule noted that, in instances in which an e-prescribing standard has also been adopted as a HIPAA transaction standard in 45 CFR part 162, the process for updating the e- prescribing standard would have to be coordinated with the maintenance and modification of the applicable HIPAA transaction standard (77 FR 29018). \n3. Adoption of NCPDP SCRIPT Standard \nVersion 2022011 as the Part D Electronic Prescribing Standard, Retirement of NCPDP SCRIPT Standard Version 2017071, and Related Conforming Changes in \u00a7 423.160 \nThe NCPDP SCRIPT standard has \nbeen the adopted electronic prescribing standard for transmitting prescriptions and prescription-related information using electronic media for covered Part D drugs for Part D eligible individuals since foundation standards were named in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the November 7, 2005 Federal Register (70 FR 67568), at the start of the Part D program. The NCPDP \nSCRIPT standard is used to exchange information between prescribers, dispensers, intermediaries and Medicare prescription drug plans. In addition to electronic prescribing, the NCPDP SCRIPT standard is used in electronic prior authorization (ePA) and medication history transactions. \nAlthough electronic prescribing is \noptional for physicians, except as to Schedule II, III, IV, and V controlled substances that are Part D drugs prescribed under Part D, and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f4d51f0-7447-4a87-973b-2913dfd7f19f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f4d51f0-7447-4a87-973b-2913dfd7f19f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49316568-86f7-40cd-b7da-d8dcb4e0df48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d747b5410747643c2eeb72de2368b77cfc7267b8e2f3b6257e19260ccac2c338"}, "3": {"node_id": "62e91a6e-f7ff-4be5-a7df-a52379df2509", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3bee99bbcba39bcf68a4ef39e809beb84e1fa779308922c1f0697438cb6bc2e9"}}, "hash": "97c960a4ed967cc74646277cd5f09120bfb2806563e533e20ee7ba47ee7b4744", "text": "79550 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n132https://standards.ncpdp.org/Standards/ \nmedia/pdf/Correspondence/2022/202201NCPDP- \nSCRIPTNextVersionLetter.pdf. pharmacies, the Medicare Part D statute \nand regulations require drug plans participating in the prescription benefit to support electronic prescribing, and physicians and pharmacies who elect to transmit prescriptions and related communications electronically must utilize the adopted standards except in limited circumstances. \nNCPDP requested that CMS adopt the \nproposed updated NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 in a letter to CMS dated January 14, 2022.\n132The \nupdated version provides a number of \nupdates that the industry and CMS support. A major enhancement includes functionality that supports a 3-way transaction among prescriber, facility, and pharmacy, which will enable electronic prescribing of controlled substances in the long-term care (LTC) setting (for which compliance actions will commence on or after January 1, 2025 as specified in \u00a7 423.160(a)(5)). Additional major enhancements include general extensibility, redesign of the Product/Drug groupings, Observation elements added to REMS transaction, ProhibitRenewalRequest added to RxChangeResponse and RxRenewalResponse, modified Structured and Codified Sig Structure format, and data element refinements and support related to dental procedure codes, RxBarCode, PatientConditions, patient gender and pronouns, TherapeuticSubstitutionIndicator, and multi-party communications and withdrawal/retracting of a previous sent message using the MessageIndicatorFlag. \nBecause the functionality offered in \nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 offers important updates and efficiencies to the healthcare industry, we believe it would be an appropriate electronic prescribing standard for the Medicare Part D program. NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 is fully backwards compatible with NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071. This allows for a less burdensome implementation process and flexible adoption timeline for the industry since backwards compatibility permits a transition period where both versions of the NCPDP SCRIPT standards may be used simultaneously. \nIn addition to its use for electronic \nprescriptions, the NCPDP SCRIPT standard is used for medication history (\u00a7 423.160(b)(4)) and ePA transactions (\u00a7 423.160(b)(8)). Thus, we propose conforming amendments to require, after a transition period, NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 as the Part D \nelectronic prescribing standard for the medication history transactions and ePA transactions in \u00a7 423.160(b)(4) and \u00a7 423.160(b)(8), respectively. \nInstead of independently naming the \nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 and incorporating the corresponding implementation guide by reference at \u00a7 423.160(c), we propose to amend \u00a7 423.160(b) throughout by cross referencing 45 CFR 170.205(b), where ONC proposes to adopt NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011. See section III.T.5. of this proposed rule for additional discussion of this coordination effort. We propose the same approach for the amendments listed at \u00a7 423.160(b)(2) for prescription transactions, discussed in this section of this proposed rule, and conforming changes at \u00a7 423.160(b)(4) for medication history transactions and at \u00a7 423.160(b)(8) for ePA transactions. \nThe proposed approach would enable \nCMS and ONC to avoid misalignment from independent adoption of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 for their respective programs. Updates to the standard would impact requirements for both programs at the same time, ensure consistency, and promote alignment for providers, payers, and health IT developers participating in and supporting the same prescription transactions. \nSince the NCPDP SCRIPT standard \nversion 2022011 is fully backwards compatible with NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, the industry can accommodate a transition period when either version may be used. We propose changes at \u00a7\u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(vi), 423.160(b)(4)(iii), and 423.160(b)(8)(iii), which, taken together with ONC proposals for 45 CFR 170.205(b), would establish a transition period from July 1, 2023 until January 1, 2025, with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2025, when use of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 will be mandatory.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62e91a6e-f7ff-4be5-a7df-a52379df2509": {"__data__": {"id_": "62e91a6e-f7ff-4be5-a7df-a52379df2509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49316568-86f7-40cd-b7da-d8dcb4e0df48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d747b5410747643c2eeb72de2368b77cfc7267b8e2f3b6257e19260ccac2c338"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f4d51f0-7447-4a87-973b-2913dfd7f19f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "97c960a4ed967cc74646277cd5f09120bfb2806563e533e20ee7ba47ee7b4744"}}, "hash": "3bee99bbcba39bcf68a4ef39e809beb84e1fa779308922c1f0697438cb6bc2e9", "text": "Given NCPDP SCRIPT standard version \n2022011 is backwards compatible with NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, we are seeking to allow Part D plans to begin updating to NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 as soon as practicable. While we are proposing July 1, 2023 for the start of the transition period, we will consider updating the proposed start date for the transition period in the final rule to align with the effective date for the final rule if it falls before July 1, 2023. \nIn its letter to CMS requesting CMS to \nadopt NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011, NCPDP requested that CMS identify certain transactions for prescriptions for which use of the standard is mandatory.

The transactions specific to ePA are also the same as those required with NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, with one additional transaction (PANotification) which was incorporated into the standard after NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071. As discussed in section III.T.6. of this proposed rule, NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 is proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.205(b)(2), and SCRIPT version 2017071 is proposed to expire on January 1, 2025 at 45 CFR 170.205(b)(1).

We also note that the RxTransfer-related transactions take place between pharmacies (that is, dispensers) and are not applicable to prescribers. Therefore, we have proposed to acknowledge this in the proposed regulation at \u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(v) by adding language that indicates that the business functions supported by the transactions listed for the transmission of prescription-related information may be between prescribers and dispensers (as stated in \u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(iv)) or between dispensers. \nMandatory use of the NCPDP SCRIPT \nstandard for the transactions listed means that the specified version of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard must be used to carry out the particular business function supported by the transaction. Mandatory use does not mean that all transactions must be utilized (that is, if the business function supported by the transaction is not needed, then the NCPDP SCRIPT standard transaction would not be utilized). For example, we have been informed that the \u2018\u2018GetMessage\u2019\u2019 transaction is not widely used among prescribers. For this reason, we are reiterating guidance\n133that the \nNCPDP SCRIPT standard transactions named are not themselves mandatory, but rather they are to be used as applicable to the entities specified at \u00a7 423.160(a) involved in completing or supporting such business functions when and if they are utilized. Our intent is that the applicable NCPDP SCRIPT standard version is used for business functions that the applicable NCPDP SCRIPT standard transactions support, which are named in regulation. We believe the pharmacy industry has implemented the standards in this manner, based on discussions with NCPDP. However, we acknowledge that the transactions currently named in regulation, and as we propose, are specific to the NCPDP SCRIPT standard. Thus, the specific transactions (based on literal interpretation) can only be used in the context of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard as a whole. We propose to add language at \u00a7\u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(v) and 423.160(b)(8)(iii) to indicate that these transactions represent the business functions for which the NCPDP SCRIPT standard transactions must be used if such business function is utilized. \nIn summary, we propose to amend \n\u00a7 423.160 by: \u2022Revising paragraph \n\u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(v) to reference \napplicable standards for transactions until June 30, 2023; \n\u2022Adding paragraph \n\u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(vi) to identify applicable standards for transactions beginning July 1, 2023; \n\u2022Adding paragraph \u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(v) \nto acknowledge the entities to whom certain transactions are applicable, to include distinction that the transactions listed represent business functions for which the NCPDP SCRIPT standard must be used, and to indicate that communication of prescriptions and prescription-related transactions listed at \u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(v)(A)\u2013(Y) must comply with 45 CFR 170.205(b).

Adoption of the NCPDP Real-Time \nPrescription Benefit (RTPB) Standard \nIn the May 2019 final rule (84 FR \n23832), which implemented the statutory provision at section 1860D\u2013 4(e)(2)(D) of the Act, CMS required at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7) that Part D plan sponsors implement, by January 1, 2021, an electronic real-time benefit tool (RTBT) capable of integrating with at least one prescriber\u2019s e-prescribing system or electronic health record (EHR) to provide prescribers with complete, accurate, timely and clinically appropriate patient-specific real-time formulary and benefit information (including out-of-pocket cost, clinically appropriate formulary alternatives, and utilization management requirements). At that time, there were no industry- wide standards for RTBTs. NCPDP has since developed and tested an RTPB standard for use with RTBT applications. In an August 20, 2021 letter to CMS, NCPDP recommended adoption of RTPB standard version 12.\n134The NCPDP RTPB standard \nversion 12 enables the real-time exchange of information about patient eligibility, patient-specific formulary and benefit information, and preferred pharmacy network participation status. For a submitted drug product, the RTPB standard will indicate coverage status, coverage restrictions, and patient financial responsibility. The RTPB standard also supports providing information on alternative pharmacies and products. \nThe NCPDP RTPB standard version 12 \nstandard is designed for prescriber, not beneficiary, RTBT applications; however, CMS is aware that the use of the NCPDP RTPB standard for the prescriber RTBT may facilitate beneficiary RTBTs since the data elements from the NCPDP RTPB standard would also be able to feed into a beneficiary RTBT.

The requirements for the beneficiary RTBT are discussed in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the January 19, 2021 Federal Register (86 FR 5864). \nAs discussed in section III.T.6. of this \nproposed rule, ONC proposes to adopt the NCPDP RTPB standard version 12 at 45 CFR 170.205(c). We therefore propose to add paragraphs \u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(vii) and \u00a7 423.160(b)(7)(i) to indicate that as of January 1, 2025, Part D sponsors\u2019 RTBT must comply with 45 CFR 170.205(c). \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \n5. Standards for Eligibility Transactions \nWe propose to revise \u00a7 423.160(b)(3) \nby adding a new paragraph (iii) to indicate that eligibility transactions must comply with 45 CFR 162.1202. Both sections currently name the NCPDP Telecommunication standard Version D.0 with equivalent batch standard Version 1.2 and the Accredited Standards Committee X12N 270/271- Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Response, Version 5010 (ASC X12N/005010x279). The eligibility standards adopted at \u00a7 423.160(b)(3)(i) and (ii) were adopted to align with those adopted at 45 CFR 162.1202, pursuant to the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Health Insurance Reform; Modifications to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA) Electronic Transaction Standards,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the January 16, 2009 Federal Register (74 FR 3326). The \nproposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Administrative Simplification: Modifications of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Retail Pharmacy Standards; and Adoption of Pharmacy Subrogation Standard,\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the November 9, 2022 Federal Register (87 FR 67634), proposes to \nupdate the HIPAA standards used for eligibility transactions. We therefore propose to streamline the Part D regulation by indicate that eligibility transactions must comply with the applicable HIPAA regulations, as opposed to naming standards independently, which would ensure, should the HIPAA standards be updated as a result of HHS rulemaking, that the \nPart D regulation would be synchronized with the required HIPAA standards. We foresee no immediate impact of this proposed change since the HIPAA regulation at 45 CFR 162.1202 currently identifies the same standards as those named in the Part D regulation at \u00a7 423.160(b)(3)(i) and (ii), but we believe establishing a cross- reference would help avoid potential future conflicts so that the industry and CMS would not be at risk of compliance issues. \nThus, we propose to modify \n\u00a7 423.160(b)(3) by adding a new paragraph (iii) to indicate that eligibility transactions should comply with 45 CFR 162.1202. We also propose to replace earlier references to \u00a7 423.160(b)(3) in paragraphs \u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) with revised references to \u00a7 423.160(b)(3)(i) and (ii), to specify where these historical standards referred to the standards specifically named at \u00a7 423.160(b)(3)(i) and (ii). This approach would avoid ambiguity with respect to historical expectations from prior to April 1, 2009 through the proposed effective date of July 1, 2023, which we propose in \u00a7 423.160(b)(1)(vi). \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \nT.

These proposals reflect a unified approach across the Department to adopt standards for electronic prescribing activities that have previously been adopted separately by CMS and ONC under independent \nauthorities. This new approach is intended to increase alignment across HHS and reduce regulatory burden for stakeholders subject to program requirements that incorporate these standards. 2. Statutory Authority \nThe Health Information Technology \nfor Economic and Clinical Health Act \n(HITECH Act), Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111\u20135), was enacted on February 17, 2009. The HITECH Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and created \u2018\u2018Title XXX\u2014Health Information Technology and Quality\u2019\u2019 (Title XXX) to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of health IT and exchange of electronic health information (EHI). Subsequently, Title IV of the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114\u2013255) (Cures Act) amended portions of the HITECH Act by modifying or adding certain provisions to the PHSA relating to health IT. \n3. Adoption of Standards and \nImplementation Specifications \nSection 3001 of the PHSA directs the \nNational Coordinator for Health Information Technology (National Coordinator) to perform duties in a manner consistent with the development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information. Section \n3001(b) of the PHSA establishes a series of core goals for development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that\u2014 \n\u2022Ensures that each patient\u2019s health \ninformation is secure and protected, in accordance with applicable law; \n\u2022Improves health care quality, \nreduces medical errors, reduces health disparities, and advances the delivery of patient-centered medical care; \n\u2022Reduces health care costs resulting \nfrom inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, duplicative care, and incomplete information; \n\u2022Provides appropriate information to \nhelp guide medical decisions at the time and place of care; \n\u2022Ensures the inclusion of meaningful \npublic input in such development of such infrastructure; \n\u2022Improves the coordination of care \nand information among hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, and other entities through an effective infrastructure for the secure and authorized exchange of health care information; \n\u2022Improves public health activities \nand facilitates the early identification and rapid response to public health threats and emergencies, including bioterror events and infectious disease outbreaks; \n\u2022Facilitates health and clinical \nresearch and health care quality; \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90996267-af49-413e-87b6-33997cfe09bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "90996267-af49-413e-87b6-33997cfe09bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c91a6f7-7236-4c58-a0ed-e64380c1abda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "149e9e6d548fdceb21a08e59f3170cb82e933bb8f73f0ec0a8413c02ae2a57ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "20cbe247-7c20-4145-aa7c-3e95e11e993b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0bfb8dc175b63b6b62a9be818c83b868231d956039ce0ceae104b1e1d3b532a8"}}, "hash": "3fea298337a2cf6a8319c43c405370a750ef18c34e36f47277d14f053ca57b2f", "text": "79553 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n135HITAC Policy Framework Recommendations, \nFebruary 21, 2018: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/ \ndefault/files/page/2019-07/2018-02-21_ HITAC_\nPolicy-Framework_ FINAL_ 508-signed.pdf. \n136HITAC Annual Report CY 2019 published \nMarch 2, 2020: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/ default/files/page/2020-03/ HITAC%20Annual%20Report%20for%20FY19_508.pdf. \n137HITAC recommendations on priority target \nareas, October 16, 2019: https://www.healthit.gov/ sites/default/files/page/2019-12/2019-10-16_ ISP_\nTF_Final_ Report_ signed_ 508.pdf. \u2022Promotes early detection, \nprevention, and management of chronic \ndiseases; \n\u2022Promotes a more effective \nmarketplace, greater competition, greater systems analysis, increased consumer choice, and improved outcomes in health care services; and \n\u2022Improves efforts to reduce health \ndisparities. \nSection 3004 of the PHSA identifies a \nprocess for the adoption of health IT standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria, and authorizes the Secretary to adopt such standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. As specified in section 3004(a)(1) of the PHSA, the Secretary is required, in consultation with representatives of other relevant Federal agencies, to jointly review standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria endorsed by the National Coordinator under section 3001(c) of the PHSA and subsequently determine whether to propose the adoption of any grouping of such standards, implementation specifications, or certification criteria. The Secretary is required to publish all determinations in the Federal Register. \nSection 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA, \nwhich is titled \u2018\u2018Subsequent Standards Activity,\u2019\u2019 provides that the Secretary shall adopt additional standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria as necessary and consistent with the schedule published by the Health IT Advisory Committee (HITAC). As noted in the final rule, \u2018\u20182015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and \nONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications\u2019\u2019 (ONC 2015 Edition Final Rule), which appeared in the October 16, 2015 Federal Register, we consider this provision in the broader context of the HITECH Act and the Cures Act to grant the Secretary the authority and discretion to adopt standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria that have been recommended by the HITAC and endorsed by the National Coordinator, as well as other appropriate and necessary health IT standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria (80 FR 62606). \nUnder the authority outlined in \nsection 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA, the Secretary may adopt standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria as necessary even if those standards have not been recommended and endorsed through the process established for the HITAC under section 3002(b)(2) and (3) of the PHSA. \nMoreover, while HHS has traditionally adopted standards and implementation specifications at the same time as adopting certification criteria that reference those standards, the Secretary\u2019s authority under section 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA is not limited to adopting standards or implementation specifications at the same time certification criteria are adopted. \nFinally, the Cures Act amended the \nPHSA by adding section 3004(c), which specifies that in adopting and implementing standards under section 3004, the Secretary shall give deference to standards published by standards \ndevelopment organizations and voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. \n4. Alignment With Federal Advisory \nCommittee Activities \nThe HITECH Act established two \nFederal advisory committees, the HIT Policy Committee (HITPC) and the HIT Standards Committee (HITSC). Each was responsible for advising the National Coordinator on different aspects of health IT policy, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. \nSection 4003(e) of the Cures Act \namended section 3002 of the PHSA and replaced the HITPC and HITSC with one committee, the HITAC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20cbe247-7c20-4145-aa7c-3e95e11e993b": {"__data__": {"id_": "20cbe247-7c20-4145-aa7c-3e95e11e993b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c91a6f7-7236-4c58-a0ed-e64380c1abda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "149e9e6d548fdceb21a08e59f3170cb82e933bb8f73f0ec0a8413c02ae2a57ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "90996267-af49-413e-87b6-33997cfe09bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3fea298337a2cf6a8319c43c405370a750ef18c34e36f47277d14f053ca57b2f"}}, "hash": "0bfb8dc175b63b6b62a9be818c83b868231d956039ce0ceae104b1e1d3b532a8", "text": "After that change, section 3002(a) of the PHSA establishes that the HITAC advises and recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria relating to the implementation of a health IT infrastructure, nationally and locally, that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of health information. The Cures Act specifically directed the HITAC to advise on two areas: (1) A policy framework to advance an interoperable health information technology infrastructure (section 3002(b)(1) of the PHSA); and (2) priority target areas for standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria (section 3002(b)(2) of the PHSA). \nFor the policy framework, as \ndescribed in section 3002(b)(1)(A) of the PHSA, the Cures Act tasked the HITAC with providing recommendations to the National Coordinator on a policy framework for adoption by the Secretary consistent with the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan under section 3001(c)(3) of the PHSA. In February of 2018, the HITAC made recommendations to the National Coordinator for the initial policy framework\n135and subsequently \npublished a schedule in the Federal \nRegister and an annual report on the \nwork of the HITAC and ONC to implement and evolve that framework.\n136For the priority target \nareas for standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria, section 3002(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA identified that in general, the HITAC would recommend to the National Coordinator, for purposes of adoption under section 3004 of the PHSA, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and an order of priority for the development, harmonization, and recognition of such standards, specifications, and certification criteria. In October of 2019, the HITAC finalized recommendations on priority target areas for standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria.\n137 \n5. Aligned Approach to Standards Adoption \nHistorically, the ONC Health IT \nCertification Program and the Part D Program have maintained complementary policies of aligning health IT certification criteria and associated standards related to electronic prescribing, medication history, and electronic prior authorization for prescriptions. Prescribers of Medicare Part D covered drugs that are prescribed for a Medicare Part D eligible individual must generally \nadhere to the standards set by the Part D Program for conveying prescriptions using electronic media, while participants in the Promoting Interoperability programs must use technology certified under ONC\u2019s Health IT Certification Program to complete measures included in the program, including e-prescribing. Alignment across the standards adopted for these HHS programs is critical to ensure consistent regulatory requirements for Part D plan sponsors, health care providers, and health IT developers who implement and utilize technology tools for electronic prescribing. In addition to adopting the same standards, ONC and CMS must \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75d891a9-9930-462a-9729-1b8d0cd250a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "75d891a9-9930-462a-9729-1b8d0cd250a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "107dda1c-55aa-4df9-a6c7-c343aa8e059d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e1eee4a67fc2698fa3c26cac91ba169243c82c88e75638a5fac5c4f7e2662736"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bf31db9-ee07-4340-94c6-8ca223321335", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0e2c352ba62d7ee049afdaa43a0db06c66ff942bcc71fc76b3509806a4e753a8"}}, "hash": "dcf54d16996f6c3bb268e6a62d9e1c71568ea3092cfd2e8efebc37bff4d3a62a", "text": "79554 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n138See the archived version of the Certification \nCompanion Guide for the \u2018\u2018electronic prescribing\u2019\u2019 \ncertification criterion in 45 CFR 170.315(b)(3): https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/ 2020-12/b3_ ccg.pdf. also align the requirements for use of \nthose standards within their respective programs. \nIn this section of this proposed rule, \nwe briefly summarize past standards adoption activities under section 3004 of the PHSA intended to ensure alignment for electronic prescribing and related activities across the ONC Health IT Certification Program and the Part D Program. \nOn January 13, 2010, the Secretary \nissued an interim final rule \u2018\u2018Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology\u2019\u2019 (2010 interim final rule) which adopted an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria to meet the requirement specified at section 3004(b)(1) of the PHSA (75 FR 2013). To ensure consistency with standards previously adopted by CMS under the MMA for electronic prescribing, the 2010 interim final rule adopted NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 8.1 by referencing the Part D requirement for use of the standard in \u00a7 423.160. The 2010 interim final rule also adopted the Formulary and Benefits standard version 1.0 (75 FR 2031) for the purposes of performing a drug formulary check by referencing the Part D requirement for use of the standard in \u00a7 423.160. \nOn July 28, 2010, ONC\u2019s final rule \n\u2018\u2018Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology\u2019\u2019 to complete the adoption of an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria, appeared in the Federal Register (75 FR 44589). In that final rule, ONC replaced the reference to \u00a7 423.160 adopted in the 2010 interim final rule, as previously described, by adopting and incorporating by reference both NCPDP SCRIPT standard version \n8.1 and NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 10.6 in 45 CFR 170.205. As stated in the final rule, ONC finalized this policy to align with the adoption and incorporation by reference of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 10.6 by CMS in the \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Identification of Backward Compatible Version of Adopted Standard for E- Prescribing and the Medicare Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP SCRIPT 10.6)\u2019\u2019 interim final rule, which appeared in the July 1, 2010 Federal Register (75 FR 38026). \nMost recently, in the \u2018\u201821st Century \nCures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program\u2019\u2019 final rule (ONC \n21st Century Cures Act Final Rule), which was effective June 30, 2020, ONC adopted NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 in 45 CFR 170.205(b)(1) and incorporated it by reference in 45 CFR 170.299 (85 FR 25678). By adopting this standard, ONC aligned with the \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2019 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-Service, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program\u2019\u2019 final rule (2019 Part C/D final rule), which appeared in the April 16, 2018 Federal Register, in which CMS adopted and incorporated NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 in \u00a7 423.160(b)(2)(iv) for use beginning in January 2020 (83 FR 16440). \nWhile CMS and ONC have worked \nclosely together to ensure consistent adoption of standards through regulatory actions, as previously described, we recognize that the current practice of different HHS components conducting parallel adoption of the same standards may result in additional regulatory burden and confusion for stakeholders. As a result of different HHS components maintaining and updating separate regulatory provisions in different areas of the Code of Federal Regulations for health IT standards that impact the same stakeholders, impacted stakeholders must monitor changes to standards in multiple regulatory vehicles. In addition, ONC and CMS must identify separate regulatory vehicles and pursue separate rulemaking processes in which to adopt the same standard. Due to other constraints around regulatory cycles in each agency, proposed and final actions to adopt the same standard may occur on different timelines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bf31db9-ee07-4340-94c6-8ca223321335": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bf31db9-ee07-4340-94c6-8ca223321335", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "107dda1c-55aa-4df9-a6c7-c343aa8e059d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e1eee4a67fc2698fa3c26cac91ba169243c82c88e75638a5fac5c4f7e2662736"}, "2": {"node_id": "75d891a9-9930-462a-9729-1b8d0cd250a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dcf54d16996f6c3bb268e6a62d9e1c71568ea3092cfd2e8efebc37bff4d3a62a"}}, "hash": "0e2c352ba62d7ee049afdaa43a0db06c66ff942bcc71fc76b3509806a4e753a8", "text": "For instance, due to discrepancies between regulatory timelines, adoption of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 in different rules (respectively, the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule and the 2019 Part C/D final rule) led to a period where ONC had to exercise special enforcement discretion in the ONC Health IT Certification Program.\n138 \nStakeholders affected by these updates expressed repeated concerns during this period regarding when updates to \nrespective standards would be finalized and how these regulatory contingencies would affect program requirements \nreferencing these standards. \nGiven past concerns, ONC and CMS \nare seeking to pursue a new approach to alignment of standards in this proposed rule. Under this approach, HHS would adopt the standards specified (the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 and the NCPDP Real-Time Prescription Benefit standard version 12) under the Secretary\u2019s authority to adopt health IT standards in the PHSA. If finalized, these proposals would result in the adoption and incorporation by reference to the proposed standards in a single Code of Federal Regulations location at 45 CFR 170.205. Programs across HHS could then cross-reference the adopted standards. As more than one version of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard would be specified in 45 CFR 170.205(b) if our proposal is finalized, we have also identified an expiration date for the current version of the standard to clearly specify when versions of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard in 45 CFR 170.205(b) would be available for use by HHS programs. \nWe note that these proposals pertain \nonly to the adoption and incorporation by reference of the proposed standards, and when these standards are available for use by HHS. CMS and ONC would continue to set other program requirements independently for programs such as the ONC Health IT Certification Program and the Part D Program, which may require use of these standards. For instance, program requirements may continue to include provisions such as additional amendments or guidance related to use of standards specific to each program. However, we believe that the approach reflected in these proposals for adoption of standards in a single CFR location for HHS use will help to address the \nconcerns around alignment, as previously described. We are requesting comment on this approach to adopting standards in a single location for HHS use. \n6. Proposal To Adopt Standards for Use \nby HHS \nConsistent with section 3004(b)(3) of \nthe PHSA and the efforts, as previously described, to evaluate and identify standards for adoption, we propose to adopt the following implementation specifications in 45 CFR 170.205(b)(2) and (c), on behalf of the Secretary, to support the continued development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure as described under section 3001(b) of the PHSA, and to support Federal alignment of standards for interoperability and health information exchange.

Electronic Prescribing \nAs discussed previously, ONC has \npreviously adopted three versions of the \nNCPDP SCRIPT standard in 45 CFR 170.205. Most recently, we adopted NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule to facilitate the transfer of prescription data among pharmacies, prescribers, and payers (85 FR 25678). \nThe updated NCPDP SCRIPT standard \nversion 2022011 includes important enhancements, such as additions for drug utilization review/use (DUR/DUE) alerts and formulary information, as well as transactions to relay medication history and for a facility to notify a pharmacy of resident information. Enhancements have been added to support electronic prior authorization functions as well as electronic transfer of prescriptions between pharmacies.\n139 \nWe propose to remove NCPDP \nSCRIPT standard version 10.6 from 45 CFR 170.205(b)(2) and to adopt NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011\n140in \n45 CFR 170.205(b)(2). We note that NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 10.6 is no longer required for use in either the Part D Program or the ONC Health IT Certification Program, and we believe it is appropriate to remove this standard from the Code of Federal Regulations. We also propose to incorporate NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 by reference in 45 CFR 170.299. \nRegarding the NCPDP SCRIPT \nstandard version 2017071, we propose to revise the regulatory text in 45 CFR 170.205(b)(1) to specify that adoption of this standard will expire on January 1, 2025. If these proposals are finalized, this would mean that both the 2017071 and 2022011 versions of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard would be available for \nHHS use from the effective date of a final rule until January 1, 2025. This \u2018\u2018transition period\u2019\u2019 is consistent with previous policy in both the ONC Health IT Certification Program and the Part D program with respect to versions of e- prescribing standards which allow for concurrent usage. On and after January 1, 2025, only the 2022011 version of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard would be available for HHS use where a standard \nin 45 CFR 170.205(b) is required. \nWe request comment on the \nappropriateness of this proposed expiration date for NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, and whether we should consider, as an alternative, finalizing a transition period of an additional year, up to January 1, 2026, or a longer period. We are interested in whether commenters believe an extended transition period, during which use of both standards would be \nallowed for programs requiring use of a standard in 45 CFR 170.205(b), would be appropriate. We welcome any information commenters can provide about the time needed for stakeholders to implement the updated version of the standard for different uses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbcd7978-cdf5-4486-ab9d-ec42b0336d11": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbcd7978-cdf5-4486-ab9d-ec42b0336d11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8fb719f-e21b-4081-b03b-20dbf4ee9e4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "335f2e4e5f20cd0b50fe1baac6749ff01cc6dfa860d258afd57ade30db77fc57"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d31396b-2b46-40eb-9829-afccc92cc0c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "df2409b97c98d26b9975b06d83e51f5fb1d1c70f6df74d78632a2edc6bf8347d"}}, "hash": "c45d5f9cf440ac8837e9157dafb163aa321cb2e9c3f66c24e4280edf0587b18e", "text": "While we are not proposing changes \nto the \u2018\u2018electronic prescribing\u2019\u2019 certification criterion in the ONC Health IT Certification Program (45 CFR 170.315(b)(3)) in this proposed rule, ONC will consider any updates to this criterion in future rulemaking to align with the updated NCPDP SCRIPT standard and with the Part D program, should this proposal be finalized, consistent with past practice. \nb. Real Time Prescription Benefit \nWe propose to adopt the NCPDP Real- \nTime Prescription Benefit standard \nversion 12 to meet the requirements of Division CC, Title I, Subtitle B, Section 119 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA), Public Law 116\u2013260. The CAA required sponsors of Medicare prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage Organizations to implement a real-time benefit tool that meets technical standards named by the Secretary, in consultation with ONC. The NCPDP Real-Time Prescription Benefit standard version 12\n141enables \nthe exchange of patient eligibility, product coverage, and benefit financials for a chosen product and pharmacy, and identifies coverage restrictions and alternatives when they exist. \nIn section III.S. of this proposed rule, \nCMS is proposing to require Part D plan sponsors to comply with this standard when implementing the real-time benefit tool or tools required in \u00a7 423.160(b)(7). In addition, section 119(b) of the CAA amended the definition of a \u2018\u2018qualified electronic health record\u2019\u2019 in section 3000(13) of the PHSA to specify that a \u2018\u2018qualified electronic health record\u2019\u2019 must include or be capable of including a real-time benefit tool. ONC intends to address this provision in future rulemaking for the ONC Health IT Certification Program \nand will ensure alignment with the proposed NCPDP Real-Time Prescription Benefit standard version 12, should our proposal be finalized, and related proposals in the Part D program where appropriate. \nWe also note that the HITAC has \npreviously addressed real-time prescription benefit standards, consistent with its statutory role to recommend standards. In 2019, the HITAC accepted the recommendations included in the 2018 report of the Interoperability Priorities Task Force, including recommendations to continue to monitor standards then being developed for real-time prescription benefit transactions, and, when the standards are sufficiently validated, to require EHR vendors to provide functionality that integrates real time patient-specific prescription benefit checking into the prescribing workflow.\n142In early 2020, the National \nCommittee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and HITAC convened another task force, the Intersection of Clinical and Administrative Data (ICAD) Task Force, which was charged with convening industry experts and producing recommendations related to electronic prior authorizations. The task force report was presented to HITAC in November 2020\n143and discussed the \nNCPDP Real-Time Prescription Benefit \nstandard as an important tool for addressing administrative transactions around prescribing. \nWe are proposing to adopt the NCPDP \nReal-Time Prescription Benefit standard version 12\n144in 45 CFR 170.205(c)(1) \nand to incorporate this standard by reference in 45 CFR 170.299. As noted in section III.S.4. of this proposed rule, CMS proposes at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7)(i) to require this standard for use by Part D plan sponsors to fulfill the requirements for real-time benefit tools at \u00a7 423.160(b)(7). As previously noted, ONC will consider proposals to require use of this standard to support real-time benefit tool functionality in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, consistent with Section 119 of the CAA, in future rulemaking. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d29d86a2-91a7-4e88-b45e-b339233a05c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d29d86a2-91a7-4e88-b45e-b339233a05c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f3eb8ce-4891-4226-b312-c4898b009faf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ff38082cab68a20377f8aebb0e069a4a7060f7a20521daf611a85fbaa28d11e4"}, "3": {"node_id": "67657127-da59-4556-bcd4-e18532bdd702", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "96c5bffec7d056274599141812eb77c692d32e8c09d7621f43ed72e4a5a82fc8"}}, "hash": "e05fff76de5a12d9dbec438e0dd2939a12363f57783c1b95fb6692c840b3bc48", "text": "79556 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n145See https://www.healthit.gov/isa. \n146See https://www.healthit.gov/isa/section/ \npharmacyinteroperability. c. Interoperability Standards Advisory \nONC\u2019s Interoperability Standards \nAdvisory (ISA) supports the \nidentification, assessment, and public awareness of interoperability standards and implementation specifications that can be used by the health care industry to address specific interoperability needs.\n145The ISA is updated on an \nannual basis based on recommendations received from public comments and subject matter expert feedback. This public comment process reflects ongoing dialogue, debate, and consensus among industry stakeholders when more than one standard or implementation specification could be used to address a specific interoperability need. \nONC currently identifies the \nstandards proposed for adoption in this section within the ISA as available standards for a variety of potential use cases. The NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2022011 and the NCPDP Real- Time Prescription Benefit standard version 12 are currently identified under the \u2018\u2018Pharmacy Interoperability\u2019\u2019 domain.\n146We encourage interested \nparties to review the ISA to better understand key applications for the implementation specifications proposed for adoption in this proposed rule. \n7. ONC Health IT Certification Program \nAs previously noted, we are not \nproposing new or revised certification \ncriteria based on the proposed adoption of standards within this rulemaking. Regarding the Real-Time Prescription Benefit Standard, Section 119 of the CAA does not require ONC to adopt certification criteria for RTBT at the same time as the standard, but instead allows that the criteria be established after the standard has been adopted by HHS. We are therefore proposing to adopt the standard for HHS use and, as previously discussed, ONC would address new or revised certification criteria referencing the standard, if finalized, in separate rulemaking. We believe this will not only support alignment across HHS, but will allow for continued input from interested parties on how this standard should be incorporated into specific certification criteria for certified health IT functionality prior to any such proposals in future rulemaking. ONC will continue to collaborate with CMS to ensure that any future proposals in the ONC Health IT Certification Program continue to advance alignment with program requirements under the Part D \nProgram. \nWe believe the approach reflected in \nthe standards proposals in this proposed rule will support Federal alignment and coordination of Federal activities with adopted standards and implementation specifications for a wide range of systems, use cases, and data types within the broad scope of health information exchange. Historically, State, Federal, and local partners have leveraged the standards adopted by ONC on behalf of HHS to inform program requirements, technical requirements for grants and funding opportunities, and systems implementation for health information exchange. We believe the adoption of these standards will support HHS partners in setting technical requirements and advancing the use of innovative health IT solutions for electronic prescribing and related activities. \nU. Incorporation by Reference (45 CFR \n170.299) \nThe Office of the Federal Register has \nestablished requirements for materials (for example, standards and implementation specifications) that agencies propose to incorporate by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (79 FR 66267; 1 CFR 51.5(a)). Specifically, 1 CFR 51.5(a) requires agencies to discuss, in the preamble of a proposed rule, the ways that the materials it proposes to incorporate by reference are reasonably available to interested parties or how it worked to make those materials reasonably available to interested parties; and summarize, in the preamble of the proposed rule, the material it proposes to incorporate by reference. \nTo make the materials we intend to \nincorporate by reference reasonably available, we provide a uniform resource locator (URL) for the standards \nand implementation specifications.

Limitation on PDP Contracts Held by \nSubsidiaries of the Same Parent (\u00a7 423.272) \n1. Overview and Summary \nWe are proposing to limit the number \nof PDP contracts under which a Part D \nsponsor or its parent organization (as defined in \u00a7 423.4), directly or through subsidiaries, can offer individual market PBPs in a PDP region to one contract per region. Individual market PBPs are plans that are marketed to all Medicare beneficiaries in a region, unlike employer group waiver plans, which are only open to retirees whose employers contract with them to provide Part D benefits. This requirement would promote longstanding CMS policy to encourage meaningful competition among and a level playing field for Part D sponsors in the Part D program. The policy to promote meaningful competition has been implemented through our crosswalk policy (discussed in section IV.AD. of this proposed rule), the limit of three per region on the number of PDP plan benefit packages (PBP) that a sponsor can offer (codified effective January 1, 2022 at current \n\u00a7 423.265(b)(2)), the requirement that PDP PBPs offered by a sponsor be \u2018\u2018substantially different\u2019\u2019 (codified effective January 1, 2011 at \u00a7 423.272(b)(3)), and the prohibition on approval of applications that would result in a sponsor or its parent holding more than one PDP contract per region (codified effective July 22, 2014 at \u00a7 423.503(a)(3)). \n2. Discussion \nSince the beginning of the Part D \nprogram, CMS has promoted meaningful \ncompetition among Part D sponsors and meaningful choice among plans for Part D beneficiaries. CMS has pursued multiple avenues to promote these goals. CMS attempts to ensure that PDP sponsors only offer the number and type of PBPs necessary to provide beneficiaries meaningfully different plan options. Effective January 1, 2022, we codified at \u00a7 423.265(b) our longstanding policy limiting the number of PBPs a PDP sponsor may offer to no more than three in a service area. These offerings may not include more than one PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage, as defined at \u00a7 423.100, and no more than two enhanced alternative plans, as defined at \u00a7 423.104(f)(1). The enhanced plan offerings must be \u2018\u2018substantially different\u2019\u2019 from the basic prescription drug coverage pursuant to \u00a7 423.272(b)(3). All three PBPs are usually offered under the same contract, although if a sponsor or its parent holds multiple contracts, the sponsor may only operate three PBPs across all the contracts in the region. CMS allows Part D sponsors, or the parent organizations of Part D sponsors, a two-year transition period to meet these requirements after they have acquired another Part D sponsor pursuant to \u00a7 423.272(b)(3)(ii). Finally, under \u00a7 423.503(a)(3), CMS does not approve an application to qualify as a PDP sponsor that would result in the applicant\u2019s parent organization, directly or through subsidiaries, holding more than one PDP sponsor contract offering individual market plans in a PDP region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "682a0b03-a9d6-4ffa-943b-ee1e90609513": {"__data__": {"id_": "682a0b03-a9d6-4ffa-943b-ee1e90609513", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f3a3e39-8948-45d7-bc9a-de02f5fcf3ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8643571553f67068c5a5f14dfabcb53785691fbe5665cb099ed00eeeab6219a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f824c8a-89ce-4839-a3cd-afc3ccfc0546", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "da4703f053ed4494b9ab975bbcbcefd3c5aa0be551f0a98ba5c7640105ea8f6d"}}, "hash": "f299549a2eb8d445153b49bdf6369fded87c81f7e5d356aba5c9482c2849568a", "text": "Consistent with these requirements, \nCMS has traditionally encouraged PDP \nsponsors and their parent organizations that acquire new PDP contracts by, for example, merging with or acquiring other PDP sponsors to consolidate their PDP contracts so that they only offer individual market PBPs under one PDP contract per PDP region. Individual market PBPs are plans that are marketed to all Medicare beneficiaries in a region, unlike employer group waiver plans, which are only open to retirees whose employers contract with them to \nprovide Part D benefits. Such contract consolidations are accomplished through contract consolidation crosswalks, described in section IV.AD. of this proposed rule, which allow sponsors to transfer enrollment from a non-renewing PDP to the surviving PDP. \nCMS advises that plans take not more \nthan two full benefit years to accomplish a consolidation. CMS uses its negotiation authority under section 1860D\u201311(d)(2)(B) of the Act, the three- plan limit, and the substantial difference requirement to encourage consolidations. Both the three-plan limit and the substantial difference requirements are applied at the parent organization level\u2014that is, a parent organization with subsidiaries that hold multiple contracts in a PDP region cannot, after the two-year transition period following acquisition, offer more than three PDP PBPs in that region. PDP sponsors usually consolidate their PDPs in response to our encouragement and to accommodate the three-plan limit and substantial difference requirements, but some have delayed consolidation or declined to consolidate altogether. In proposing to require consolidations, CMS intends not only to promote meaningful choice and competition, but to ensure a level playing field for all affected PDP sponsors. \nAt \u00a7 423.272(b), we propose to add a \nnew paragraph (5) to codify limits on the number of PDP contracts held by subsidiaries of the same parent organization in a PDP region. We propose to adopt this requirement pursuant to our authority to add additional contract terms and conditions, not inconsistent with Part C, as necessary and appropriate (see section 1860D\u201312(b)(3)(D) of the Act). We propose to add a new paragraph (5)(i) to provide that CMS would no longer approve bids that would result in a PDP sponsor or a PDP sponsor\u2019s parent organization, directly or through its subsidiaries, offering individual market PBPs under more than one PDP contract in a PDP region. This proposed requirement would not apply to EGWP PBPs. For instance, if Parent Organization 1 had two subsidiaries, Sponsor 1 and Sponsor 2, that each had a PDP contract in Region 3 for at least the past two years, CMS would not approve the bids from both Sponsor 1 and Sponsor 2 unless one of the contracts was non-renewed or its service area reduced so it no longer served Region 3.

Two subsidiaries of the same parent organizations offering plans in the same PDP region are not truly competitors, as decisions concerning their operations are ultimately controlled by a single entity or parent organization. PDP sponsors under common parent organizations usually share leadership and operational staff, use the same pharmacy benefit manager, and use the same systems and procedures to administer the Part D benefit across different contracts. Because of \u00a7 423.503(a)(3), the only way a parent organization could have two PDP sponsor contracts in a region is if they applied for them before we adopted \u00a7 423.503(a)(3) in 2014 or if they purchase an existing PDP sponsor. CMS does not believe that it is fair to continue to allow these exceptions to our general policy limiting the number of contracts that a parent organization may operate in a region. \nCMS is also concerned that Part D \nsponsors and parent organizations offering multiple PDPs in a region may do so to segment risk or manipulate Part D Star Ratings. Informal communications with organizations seeking multiple contracts in a region have indicated that some of these organizations wish to segregate low- income beneficiaries into their own contract and/or confine the experience of a low performing plan to a single contract. Allowing organizations to isolate low income, or otherwise high risk or high cost, individuals into a single contract subverts Part D nondiscrimination requirements at section 1860D\u201311(e)(2)(D)(i) of the Act. Allowing segregation of low performing plans in a different contract from higher performing plans offered by a subsidiary of the same parent organization also undermines the integrity of CMS\u2019s Star Ratings. CMS assigns star ratings at the contract level. Ratings are meant to reflect all aspects of the PDP operations controlled by a contracting entity. This purpose is undermined when a parent organization is allowed to effectively administer two or more PDP contracts in a region in a way that would allow them to inflate their Star Ratings under one of the contracts by confining poor- performing plans to another contract. Such manipulation of the Star Ratings could mislead beneficiaries about the performance of the organization \nresponsible for administering a plan. \nCMS recognizes that consolidating \ncontracts held by subsidiaries of the same parent organization can be complex and requires careful planning, particularly if one or more of these contracts was recently acquired through the purchase of or merger with another PDP sponsor. Consistent with CMS\u2019s current practice, CMS is therefore proposing at new paragraphs (5)(ii) and (iii) to allow sponsors or parent organizations that acquire new PDP contracts or that operate more than one contract in a PDP region as of January 1, 2024 a transition period of two bid cycles to reduce the number of PDP contracts offering individual market PBPs to one per region. This proposed requirement would not apply to EGWP PBPs, so that subsidiaries of a parent organization could continue to operate multiple PDP contracts in a region so long as all but one of those contracts only operated EGWP PBPs in that region. \nConsolidating PDP contracts results in \nthe beneficiaries from one contract being transferred, or \u2018\u2018crosswalked,\u2019\u2019 into a PBP in another contract held by a subsidiary of the same parent organization. We are proposing to codify this process at section IV.AD. of this proposed rule. Consolidations can involve substantial disruption to operations and affected enrollees\u2019 experience. Particularly where a newly acquired PDP contract is served by a different pharmacy benefit manager, sponsors must plan carefully to update systems and transfer information in a way that minimizes disruptions for beneficiaries. Benefits can also vary significantly between PBPs offered under different PDP contracts immediately following an acquisition. Based on its experience in the program, CMS has found that a transition period of two bid cycles is sufficient for plans to minimize disruptions by planning for transitions and, where appropriate, gradually adjusting the benefits offered by PBPs under different contracts each year so that benefit structures between two contracts are more closely aligned before beneficiaries are crosswalked to a different contract. \nConsistent with current practice when \nencouraging consolidations and \nassessing substantial difference under \u00a7 423.272(b)(3), CMS would only apply the proposed limit on PDP contracts after the sponsor or its parent has submitted bids under multiple contracts for two contract years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "120805c1-f8ed-4bb5-abe7-1bf094292586": {"__data__": {"id_": "120805c1-f8ed-4bb5-abe7-1bf094292586", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "437b5564-8f89-414d-a1a3-0f9f32134271", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2973e682cc937a273bb757a00eb57cfae57488352ee12a71e2e6d3f468dd9403"}, "2": {"node_id": "33573f2b-e677-4551-bba9-f0214167139b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b14d8bebd437ca04d7d30b7455405e49302fee7ea303b31eba1c7d7ba6c85165"}}, "hash": "5b2a81d7618023dd53937110a899ddc9ef0dfd9b942b9ae66580b5697bf38f84", "text": "For example, if a parent organization currently operates Contract 1 in a region and acquires Contract 2 in the same region on September 1, 2024, the organization \nwould be permitted to operate multiple contracts for the remainder of 2024 and for 2025, as well as for 2026 and 2027. The parent organization would not have had the opportunity to adjust the 2025 bid in light of the acquisition because it did not acquire the contract until after the 2025 bid deadline. CMS would therefore allow them to submit bids for 2026 and 2027 in 2025 and 2026, respectively, in order to plan for an orderly transition. \nCMS acknowledges that a few Part D \nsponsors and parent organizations have operated multiple PDP contracts offering individual market PBPs in a region for many years. For the reasons already discussed, CMS does not believe that this is consistent with our policy promoting meaningful competition and beneficiary choices. Nor do we believe that allowing parent organizations whose contracts predate the 2014 restriction on approval of applications that would result in multiple PDP contracts to continue to operate multiple contracts in region is fair to other parent organizations. CMS also believes that continuing to allow these sponsors to operate multiple contracts in a region is unfair to organizations that may be required to reduce the number of contracts offered in a region following an acquisition pursuant to the proposed provisions at \u00a7 423.272(b)(5)(i) and (ii). CMS therefore proposes to require these parent organizations to reduce the number of PDPs offered in a region to one PDP per parent, per region, after a transition period of two bid cycles as described previously. For example, if this proposed rule is finalized prior to the 2024 bid submission deadline of June 5, 2023, a parent organization holding two or more PDP contracts at that time (directly or through subsidiaries) would be allowed to submit 2024 and 2025 bids for multiple contracts in 2023 and 2024, but would \nbe required to submit 2026 bids in 2025 that only included one PDP per region. \nCMS solicits comments on the length \nof the transition period proposed at paragraph (b)(5)(iii). In particular, CMS solicits comments on whether the transition periods for new acquisitions and organizations offering multiple PDP contracts on January 1, 2024 should be the different to account for the fact that organizations offering multiple PDP contracts on January 1, 2024 do not face the same transition difficulties as organizations that acquire new PDP contracts. \nIn summary, we are proposing to: \n\u2022Add \u00a7 423.272(b)(5) to limit the \nnumber of PDP contracts held by \nsubsidiaries of the same parent \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bb4fc93-34f4-4aca-b93c-34b480dc2ef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bb4fc93-34f4-4aca-b93c-34b480dc2ef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d4f9a27-a010-4076-b98e-00225e736884", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a3b3df013a679f8c65d5b5439826082c9b334645dbc63a65d45a7612809ecfa0"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ec8b652-a981-499b-b250-f9993672ae1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2da57cb77cf3885487723de67fb78f08a6df8b93997fdc7044adc3e2e93b2f9b"}}, "hash": "b49d0bb1edcf6c2326ded789d7622e752c6496b096cc0f7e854a3ccd7b3e93c8", "text": "79559 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \norganization to one PDP contract per \nregion; \n\u2022At proposed \u00a7 423.272(b)(5)(ii) & \n(iii), provide a two-year transition period for parent organizations that do not currently meet the requirement or that violate the requirement following a future acquisition to comply with the requirement. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nW.

Section 1128J(d)(1) of the Act requires a person who has received an overpayment to report and return the overpayment to the Secretary, the State, an intermediary, a carrier, or a contractor, as appropriate, and to notify the Secretary, State, intermediary, carrier or contractor to whom the overpayment was returned in writing of the reason for the overpayment. Section 1128J(d)(4)(B) of the Act defines the \nterm \u2018\u2018overpayment\u2019\u2019 as any funds that a person receives or retains under title XVIII or XIX to which the person, after applicable reconciliation, is not entitled under such title. Section 1128J(d)(4)(C) of the Act defines, the term \u2018\u2018person\u2019\u2019 for purposes of Medicare Part A and Part B to include providers and suppliers as those terms are defined in the Act. Section 1128J(d)(4)(C) of the Act also defines the term \u2018\u2018person\u2019\u2019 for purposes of Medicare Part C and Part D to include a Medicare Advantage organization (\u2018\u2018MAO\u2019\u2019) (as defined in section 1859(a)(1) of the Act) and a Part D sponsor (as defined in section 1860D\u2013 41(a)(13) of the Act). \nSection 1128J(d)(2) of the Act requires \nthat an overpayment be reported and returned by the later of: (1) the date which is 60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified; or (2) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. Section 1128J(d)(3) of the Act specifies that any overpayment retained by a person after the deadline for reporting and returning an overpayment is an obligation (as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(3)) for purposes of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729. \nSection 1128J(d)(4)(A) of the Act \nprovides that the terms \u2018\u2018knowing\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018knowingly\u2019\u2019 have the meaning given those terms in the False Claims Act at 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(1)(A). The False \nClaims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(1)(A)) defines the terms \u2018\u2018knowing\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018knowingly\u2019\u2019 to include information about which a person \u2018\u2018has actual knowledge,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.\u2019\u2019 \n1.

Strengthening Current Medicare \nAdvantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program Policies \nA. Amending the Definition of Severe or \nDisabling Chronic Condition; Defining C\u2013SNPs and Plan Types; and Codifying List of Chronic Conditions (\u00a7 422.2) \nA specialized MA plan for special \nneeds individuals, generally known as a special needs plan or SNP, is an MA plan specifically designed to provide targeted care and limit enrollment to special needs individuals. CMS defines Specialized MA Plans for Special Needs Individuals at \u00a7 422.2 as an MA coordinated care plan (CCP) that exclusively enrolls special needs individuals as set forth in \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv) and that provides Part D benefits under part 423 to all enrollees; and which has been designated by CMS as meeting the requirements of an MA SNP as determined on a case-by-case basis using criteria that include the appropriateness of the target population, the existence of clinical programs or special expertise to serve the target population, and whether the proposal discriminates against sicker members of the target population. As provided in section 1859(b)(6) of the Act and the definition in \u00a7 422.2, a special needs individual could be any one of the following: an institutionalized or institutionalized-equivalent individual; a dual eligible individual; or an individual with a severe or disabling chronic condition and who would benefit from enrollment in a specialized MA plan. Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C\u2013SNPs) are SNPs that restrict enrollment to special needs individuals with specific severe or disabling chronic conditions, defined at \u00a7 422.2. \nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 \n(BBA of 2018) (Pub. L. 115\u2013123) amended section 1859 of the Act to revise the definition of \u2018\u2018severe or disabling chronic condition\u2019\u2019 for purposes of identifying individuals eligible to enroll in C\u2013SNPs beginning January 1, 2022; add care management requirements for special needs individuals who have a severe or disabling chronic condition; direct the Secretary to convene a panel of clinical advisors to establish and update a list of severe or disabling chronic conditions that meet certain criteria; mandate the inclusion of several current C\u2013SNP chronic conditions onto the list; and direct that the panel take into account the availability of benefits in the Medicare Advantage Value-Based \nInsurance Design model. Section 1859(f)(9) of the Act, as added by the BBA, instructs the Secretary to convene the panel of clinical advisors not later than December 31, 2020 and every 5 years thereafter, to establish and update a list of conditions that meet the statutory criteria to be a severe or disabling chronic condition and conditions that meet the statutory criteria for certain other conditions that require prescription drugs, providers, and models of care that are unique to the specific populations covered by MA special needs plans. We are proposing to codify the BBA of 2018\u2019s amendment of the definition of severe or disabling chronic condition; define C\u2013SNP; update and codify the recommended list of chronic conditions by a panel of clinical advisors as specified by the BBA; and codify existing subregulatory guidance permitting the inclusion of certain chronic condition combinations for the purposes of offering single standalone C\u2013SNP plan benefit packages (PBPs). \n1. Amending the Definition of Severe or \nDisabling Chronic Condition \nSection 231 of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) amended sections 1851(a)(2)(A) and 1859(b) of the Act to authorize the creation of specialized MA plans for special needs individuals, including specialized MA plans that exclusively enroll individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions. The MMA did not define severe and disabling chronic conditions but noted that the Secretary may determine specific requirements that special needs individuals would need to meet in order to enroll in a chronic condition plan. In the proposed rule titled, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Establishment of the Medicare Advantage Program\u2019\u2019 (69 FR 46865), which appeared in the August 3, 2004 issue of the Federal Register (hereinafter, the August 2004 MA proposed rule), CMS did not propose a definition of \u2018\u2018severe or disabling chronic condition\u2019\u2019; however, we asked for comments on whether CMS should set standards for the designation of an individual with severe or disabling chronic conditions and what criteria should be used.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4c8db2c-e1bf-4f8d-9bf3-b923b6d326aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4c8db2c-e1bf-4f8d-9bf3-b923b6d326aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f313ac2-37aa-4469-8df7-b6dca939b42d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b51de74fbc3878112932dab7870668eaa96f55cfd80c322a8cb9b52036d01613"}, "2": {"node_id": "905f7e60-22af-4386-abe6-1578af780cd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f797f7eca1c953561409103cb02e08a9417ee830d07c06774041d3dd6c807f12"}}, "hash": "7bb93e27042de0e0d1cf7148f14bcac3bd8334349cfb44413a7d036e1376222c", "text": "In the ensuing final rule titled Medicare Program: Establishment of the Medicare Advantage Program (70 FR 4588), which appeared in Federal \nRegister on the January 28, 2005 \n(hereinafter the January 2005 MA final rule), we declined to establish a detailed definition of severe and disabling chronic because of concerns that a definition might limit plan flexibility. \nThe January 2005 MA final rule stated that CMS would review and evaluate proposals for specialized MA plans that serve beneficiaries who may qualify for enrollment in SNPs covering severe or disabling chronic disease categories, and that among the criteria to be considered would be the appropriateness of the target population, the existence of clinical programs or special expertise to serve the target population, and whether the proposal discriminates against \u2018\u2018sicker\u2019\u2019 members of the target population (70 FR 4596). CMS then developed a process that allowed MA organizations to identify qualifying chronic conditions. \nSection 164(e) of the Medicare \nImprovement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) added a new clause to section 1859(b)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act to clarify the definition of the special needs individuals eligible for C\u2013 SNPs. Beginning on January 1, 2010, the third type of special needs individual (in addition to the categories for individuals who were institutionalized or dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid) was defined as an individual who has one or more co-morbid and medically complex chronic condition(s) that are substantially disabling or life- threatening, has a high risk of hospitalization or other significant adverse health outcomes, and requires specialized delivery systems across domains of care. CMS continued to use the term \u2018\u2018special needs individual who has a severe or disabling chronic condition\u2019\u2019 for this group. Based on the MIPPA amendments to the Act, CMS adopted the definition of severe or disabling chronic condition at \u00a7 422.2 in the final rule with comment period titled Medicare Program; Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Benefit Programs: Negotiated Pricing and Remaining Revisions, which appeared in the Federal Register on January 12, 2009 (74 FR 1493, hereafter, the January 2009 final rule (FR)). (The January 2009 FC discussed and finalized a number of provisions related to eligibility for and performance requirements for C\u2013SNPs and SNPs generally.) \nSection 164(e) of MIPPA also directed \nthe Secretary to convene a panel of clinical advisors to determine the chronic conditions that meet the definition severe or disabling chronic conditions used in the amendment to the definition at section 1859(b)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act.

Under the new definition of special needs individual, an eligible individual must, on or after January 1, 2022, \u2018\u2018have one or more comorbid and medically complex chronic conditions that is life threatening or significantly limits overall health or function, have a high risk of hospitalization or other adverse health outcomes, and require intensive care coordination and that is listed under [section 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act].\u2019\u2019 Subsection (f)(9)(A) directs the Secretary to convene a panel of clinical advisors every 5 years to review and revise a list of chronic conditions that meet two sets of criteria: \n\u2022The amended definition of a severe \nor disabling chronic condition in subsection (b)(6)(B)(iii); and \n\u2022Conditions that require prescription \ndrugs, providers, and models of care that are unique to the specific population of enrollees in a specialized MA plan for special needs individuals and either (1) as a result of enrollment in a C\u2013SNP, the enrollee with the condition would have a reasonable expectation of meeting a certain standard regarding health status, outcomes and costs compared to other coverage options, or (2) the condition has a low prevalence in the general population of Medicare beneficiaries or a disproportionally high per-beneficiary cost. \nWe are proposing now to amend the \ndefinition of severe or disabling chronic \ncondition at \u00a7 422.2 to match the definition at section 1859(b)(6)(B)(iii)(II) of the Act and to include the specific conditions identified by the panel convened under section 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act. \nCurrently, CMS provides guidance on \nsevere or disabling chronic conditions that meet the current regulatory definition of the term in Chapter 16b of the Medicare Managed Care Manual (MMCM), which includes a list of SNP- specific chronic conditions in section 20.1.2. That list of conditions was drawn from a panel of clinical advisors established under section 164(e)(2) of the MIPPA of 2008. Starting in 2010, CMS adopted subregulatory guidance whereby a C\u2013SNP could only offer a plan benefit package (PBP) that covered one of the fifteen SNP-specific chronic conditions identified in the guidance. Several of the chronic condition categories include a list of sub conditions that provide further information regarding the types of diseases that qualify under the chronic condition categories. Examples of such conditions include autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disorders, severe hematologic disorders, chronic lung disorders, chronic disabling mental health conditions, and chronic disabling neurologic disorders. A C\u2013SNP that targets several sub-categorical disorders must enroll an eligible beneficiary who has one or more of these sub-categorical disorders; the C\u2013SNP is not permitted to exclude an eligible beneficiary having the covered condition or a covered sub- categorical condition. For example, a C\u2013 SNP that enrolls special needs individuals with a chronic and disabling mental health condition must enroll special needs individuals with one or more of the following sub- categorical conditions: bipolar disorders, major depressive disorder, paranoid disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder. Currently, C\u2013 SNPs may only cover one of the fifteen qualifying chronic conditions in a single PBP, unless the C\u2013SNP receives approval from CMS to focus on a group of severe or disabling chronic conditions. Generally, CMS believes that structuring a C\u2013SNP to target multiple commonly co-morbid conditions that are not clinically linked in their treatment would result in a general market product rather than an MA plan that is sufficiently tailored for special needs individuals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fea63766-23f7-4f90-b6ee-58e75e58da0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fea63766-23f7-4f90-b6ee-58e75e58da0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85baccf0-f71f-4b27-ad42-42e1178ff2bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "65a0fb6d451aa536b45360ea8a1cb2624b523a12bec8b7fd5eeaa6f6048018ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8de96bf-fcac-473f-8b9e-fdd38dfeb501", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7cd5748d343622f43d94839f37dc09a7896a80c425034c2cc6e1e3a1dc5940e4"}}, "hash": "bdf964ec852d180fd6dad2ef5e54bf55d3189ed4789d53117c639b5d868d67ed", "text": "Therefore, CMS will approve targeting of multiple severe or disabling chronic conditions by a C\u2013SNP only for: (1) one of the CMS-developed group of commonly co- morbid and clinically linked conditions listed in section 20.1.3.1 of Chapter 16b where the special needs individuals may have one or more of the conditions in the grouping or (2) a MAO- customized group of multiple co-morbid and clinically linked conditions where the special needs individuals served by the C\u2013SNP have all of the specified conditions. \nIn meeting its obligation under \nsection 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act to convene a panel of clinical advisors not later than December 31, 2020, to establish the list of conditions that meet the statutory criteria, CMS was committed to engaging the public\u2014 industry, advocates, beneficiaries, and medical professional societies\u2014in the discussion about appropriate SNP- specific chronic conditions.

They employed their collective national and international experience with chronic condition research and clinical practice to weigh inclusion of chronic conditions on the list. As in 2008, the panelists also considered the condition\u2019s prevalence in the Medicare population, a factor that would potentially affect the capacity of an MA organization to attract eligible enrollees and be viable in a given service area as well as being identified in section 1959(f)(9)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act as a criterion to be considered. The panelists were sensitive to the reality that C\u2013SNPs require sufficient disease prevalence and access to a specialized provider network within a marketable service area to manage risk under a capitated payment system (even with risk- adjustment of those capitated payments), and effectively and efficiently serve the targeted special needs beneficiaries. The panelists also reflected on the need for beneficiaries, health care practitioners, and the health care industry to recognize the SNP- specific chronic conditions and consider them appropriate for a specialized service delivery system in order to stimulate participation. While the Panel did consider a condition\u2019s prevalence in the Medicare population as required by section 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act, it was not charged with and did not make any additional judgments based on business considerations (that is, the potential profitability of the selected chronic conditions) as CMS expects interested MA organizations to reach their own conclusions about product offerings and markets in which they wish to operate. \nUpon review and deliberation, the \nPanel identified 22 chronic conditions as meeting the statutory criteria.

Conditions that require continued \ntherapy services in order for individuals to maintain or retain functioning. \nThe Panel recommended a number of \nchanges to the list of chronic conditions that are currently used by CMS to approve C\u2013SNPs. In this proposed rule, we are proposing to codify the list of chronic conditions created by the panel as part of the definition of severe and disabling chronic condition at \u00a7 422.2. \nThis proposal takes into account the changes recommended by the panel, as discussed in this section of this proposed rule. These changes include: \n\u2022Removed the term \u2018\u2018limited.\u2019\u2019 The \npanel chose this revision so that unlisted chronic conditions will not disqualify the enrollee from plan eligibility even if the unlisted or another listed condition is not the targeted condition that qualifies the beneficiary for a specific C\u2013SNP. In other words, the beneficiary could have other conditions beyond the index condition (which is required to be present) and still be permitted to enroll in a specific C\u2013SNP. For example, a beneficiary with heart failure could also have psoriasis or epilepsy and not be excluded from the Chronic Heart Failure C\u2013SNP. Because our proposal does not exclude a beneficiary from being a special needs individual or eligibility for an applicable C\u2013SNP if the beneficiary has conditions in addition to a severe or disabling chronic condition, we are not proposing to use the word \u2018\u2018including\u2019\u2019 in the proposed definition; our proposal is to codify the list of specific conditions (and subconditions) that have been identified as meeting the statutory criteria and avoid ambiguity regarding related but unlisted conditions; \n\u2022Renamed \u2018\u2018Chronic alcohol and \nother drug dependence\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018Chronic alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders;\u2019\u2019 \n\u2022Added dermatomyositis, psoriatic \narthritis, and scleroderma to the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "376b6758-8d43-418b-9189-8b39e7a39331": {"__data__": {"id_": "376b6758-8d43-418b-9189-8b39e7a39331", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df5add75-f062-42b0-b57e-4b26f28e94e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fe5b2c5b9bcb2f3c6a7849263369ac818e5ada7cb7e7232b12d7fbbe25c65e9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed73d6a1-a04d-4b00-aa4b-7dcd225fed83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "df44651663ef012c3de5975999a9c7a2278659d26768f0cbbb970ecf616888a7"}}, "hash": "3278a132e20efc34e9f2dba9c43af18376f507778c1526dfebbaf28a2802a83f", "text": "79563 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAutoimmune disorders chronic \ncondition category; \n\u2022The panel recommended changing \ntitle of \u2018\u2018Cancer, excluding pre-cancer conditions or in-situ status\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018Cancer; \u2018\u2018however; they did not recommend altering the current limitations to the chronic condition category, only a clerical change to the title; \n\u2022Added valvular heart disease to the \nCardiovascular disorders chronic condition category; \n\u2022Added new chronic condition \ncategory, \u2018\u2018Overweight, Obesity, and Metabolic Syndrome;\u2019\u2019 \n\u2022Added new chronic condition \ncategory, \u2018\u2018Chronic gastrointestinal disease\u2019\u2019 with the following conditions: chronic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease; \n\u2022Renamed the \u2018\u2018End Stage Renal \nDisease (ESRD) requiring dialysis\u2019\u2019 condition category to \u2018\u2018Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\u2019\u2019 with the following conditions: CKD requiring dialysis/end- stage renal disease (ESRD), and CKD not requiring dialysis; \n\u2022Added Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic \nObstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to the Chronic lung disorders chronic condition category; \n\u2022Added post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD), eating disorders, and anxiety disorders to the Chronic and disabling mental health conditions category; \n\u2022Added fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue \nsyndrome, and spinal cord injuries to the Neurologic disorders conditions category; \n\u2022Added post-organ transplantation \ncare and immunodeficiency and immunosuppressive disorders as new chronic condition categories; \n\u2022Created new chronic condition \ncategory \u2018\u2018Conditions that may cause cognitive impairment,\u2019\u2019 including the following sub-conditions: Alzheimer\u2019s disease, intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, disabling mental illness associated with cognitive impairment, and mild cognitive impairment; \n\u2022Created new chronic condition \ncategory \u2018\u2018Conditions that may cause similar functional challenges and require similar services,\u2019\u2019 including the following sub-conditions: spinal cord injuries, paralysis, limb loss, stroke, arthritis, and chronic conditions that impair vision, hearing (deafness), taste, touch, and smell; and \n\u2022Created new chronic condition \ncategory \u2018\u2018Conditions that require continued therapy services in order for individuals to maintain or retain \nfunctioning.\u2019\u2019 \nAs previously demonstrated in the \nlast three bullets, the panel recommended the creation of several new chronic condition categories that differ from how the current list of severe or disabling chronic conditions uses categories as a single condition or set of related diseases. By including these new categories, we are proposing that C\u2013 SNPs will be permitted to create benefit packages and care coordination services to address the needs of beneficiaries who share the same functional needs even if their specific disease or chronic condition may differ. For example, using the condition categories \u2018\u2018Conditions associated with cognitive impairment;\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Conditions associated with similar functional challenges and require similar services;\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Chronic conditions that impair vision, hearing (deafness), taste, touch, and smell;\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Conditions that require continued \ntherapy services in order for individuals to maintain or retain functioning;\u2019\u2019 MA organizations would have the opportunity to propose C\u2013SNPs that seek to ameliorate specific disease outcomes such as impaired vision without having to target one specific chronic condition. In another example, MA organizations would be permitted to create specific care coordination services and benefit packages to address the functional challenges facing beneficiaries with spinal cord injuries and those suffering paralysis from stroke. The challenge for SNPs would be to address the needs not of enrollees who share the same disease or chronic condition, but those diagnosed with different diseases and chronic conditions that share similar impacts on health and functionality.

We believe this new approach to creating a C\u2013SNP is in line with types of services and benefits required of current C\u2013SNPs in operation, and beneficiaries facing similar challenges would benefit from coordination of care among multiple providers for services found in a variety of settings appropriate for the enrollee\u2019s health \nchallenges. \nUnder our proposal, this new \ndefinition of severe or disabling chronic condition will be applicable for plan years that begin on or after January 1, 2025. We believe the additional delay will allow plans and CMS to put in the place the necessary operational steps to permit transition between the current list of chronic conditions and the list in this proposal. If adopted in the final rule, several current chronic conditions would transition to new chronic condition categories, such as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and End Stage Liver Disease. As of June 2022, there are 17 ESRD plans with a total enrollment of 4,529 members. There are no C\u2013SNPs that restrict enrollment to End Stage Liver Disease for CY 2022. However, if our proposal is finalized, MA organizations seeking to establish a plan covering End Stage Liver Disease would be able to do so under the proposed new category of Chronic Gastrointestinal Disease. Although this proposal would make changes to the list of conditions used by MA organizations to determine C\u2013SNP plan offerings, we believe the impact of those changes will be minimal. In addition, we are proposing the delay implementing the new chronic condition list in order to give CMS time to collect data and information related to the structuring of the proposed CKD C\u2013SNP plan bids. Per section 1853(a)(1)(H) of the Act, the capitation rates paid to MA plans for enrollees with ESRD are set separately from the capitation rates and bidding benchmarks applicable for other enrollees, which may complicate the transition to using this specific severe or disabling chronic condition category. Current ESRD C\u2013SNPs plan bids are based on a distinct bidding methodology. CMS will provide additional bid pricing information to MAOs if this proposal is finalized. We solicit comment on the proposed updates to this definition. Specifically, we are soliciting comment on our proposal to limit the regulatory definition of severe or disabling chronic condition to the list the conditions on the list established by the panel. Also, we are seeking comment on the proposed list of chronic conditions recommended by the 2019 panel of clinical advisors. We would like to call particular attention to proposed condition numbers 19 through 22.

For example, we would be interested to know whether and the extent to which MA organizations require further guidance from CMS to identify chronic conditions or diseases that would fit into condition numbers 19 through 22. \n2. Chronic Condition Special Needs \nPlan Definition, Scope and Eligibility (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2, 422.4, and 422.52) \nA C\u2013SNP must have specific \nattributes and meet certain standards that go beyond the provision of basic benefits (as defined in \u00a7 422.100(c)) and care coordination that is required of all coordinated care plans; such additional standards include the enrollment limitations and care management requirements set forth in section 1859(f) of the Act and codified in the regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.52(a) and (b), 422.101(f), and \u00a7 422.152(g). While C\u2013 SNPs must generally meet requirements that are specified to all SNPs, we believe it is important to codify a definition of C\u2013SNP that reflects how they are limited to serving special needs individuals who have a severe or disabling chronic condition, as defined in \u00a7 422.2 (and which we are also proposing to revise). Adopting a definition of C\u2013SNP in \u00a7 422.2 would be consistent with how we have previously adopted definitions for the term dual eligible special needs plan (D\u2013SNP) and specific types of D\u2013SNPs. We believe adopting a specific definition will help to clarify how C\u2013SNP specific requirements and policies are distinguishable from requirements and policies for D\u2013SNPs and I\u2013SNPs as well as different from general MA coordinated care plans. Since the intent of the proposed definition is to provide clarification for MA organizations and providers regarding the meaning and scope of C\u2013SNPs, we believe this codification will have little to no impact on MA enrollees nor accrue operational or other costs to MA organizations. Our proposal generally reflects current policy and practice, with a few modifications as discussed where applicable. \nAs part of current C\u2013SNP \nsubregulatory guidance and during the \nMA plan application process, MAOs may apply to offer a C\u2013SNP that targets any one of the following: \u2022A single CMS-approved chronic \ncondition (selected from the list in \nsection 20.1.2 of Chapter 16b); \n\u2022A CMS-approved group of \ncommonly co-morbid and clinically- linked conditions (described in section 20.1.3.1 of Chapter 16b); or \n\u2022An MA organization-customized \ngroup of multiple chronic conditions (described in section 20.1.3.2 of Chapter 16b). \nCMS recognizes that there is value for \nC\u2013SNPs to use groupings of severe or disabling chronic conditions in identifying their focus and limiting enrollment, and our proposals reflect how the MA organizations that offer C\u2013 SNPs must choose a single chronic condition from the definition of severe or disabling chronic condition or choose from a list of permitted multiple chronic conditions found in in the new subparagraphs (A) and (B) under \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv). \nFirst, we are proposing, as part of the \ndefinition of C\u2013SNP at \u00a7 422.2 and in the description of special needs plans at \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv), to codify current guidance regarding the ability of MA organizations to offer a C\u2013SNP that focuses on single or multiple chronic conditions. The proposed definition of chronic condition special needs plan (C\u2013SNP) provides that C\u2013SNPs are SNPs that restrict enrollment to MA special needs eligible individuals who have a severe or disabling chronic condition as defined in \u00a7 422.2 under this section. In other words, the chronic conditions on which a C\u2013SNP may focus are limited to those conditions listed in the definition of severe or disabling chronic condition. When a C\u2013SNP focuses on one chronic condition, enrollees must have that severe or disabling chronic \ncondition in order to enroll in the C\u2013 SNP. In addition to single chronic condition category PBPs, CMS currently permits MA organizations to apply to offer a C\u2013SNP that includes specific combinations of CMS-approved group of commonly co-morbid and clinically linked conditions, as described in section 20.1.3.1 of Chapter 16b of the MMCM.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f8b01f3-0ba9-4b67-872d-0a42f1ee5c39": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f8b01f3-0ba9-4b67-872d-0a42f1ee5c39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e5a531c-eefa-4425-bbbf-79e28f0bd24a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7d6805082f2e200c56b2ddbaa7ec951959e2135a3126a1f97f5bf0e3dd3e9c15"}, "2": {"node_id": "02aaf5f6-233a-448d-809b-08cb5259f7b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "14662442a2b455c6fb601a12997ab4127f47eb1e354f155c4f4a3d5a9ba47f52"}}, "hash": "531383a1c76d83b8996eba534c358ab6c693b87b1cf609d3fcdc9550ef05e883", "text": "We are proposing to codify how a C\u2013SNP may focus on multiple chronic conditions in two ways. The proposed definition of C\u2013SNP provides that the restricted enrollment to individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions includes restricting enrollment based on the multiple commonly co-morbid and clinically- liked conditions groupings specified in \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter. \nCurrently, CMS has identified five \ncombinations of commonly co-existing chronic conditions that may be the focus of a C\u2013SNP based on our data analysis and recognized national guidelines. The current set of combinations include: \n\u2022Diabetes mellitus and chronic heart \nfailure; \n\u2022Chronic heart failure and \ncardiovascular disorders; \n\u2022Diabetes mellitus and \ncardiovascular disorders; \n\u2022Diabetes mellitus, chronic heart \nfailure, and cardiovascular disorders; and \n\u2022Stroke and cardiovascular \ndisorders. \nAs of March 2022, MA organizations \noffered 178 C\u2013SNPs covering more than one chronic condition. A majority of these plans (151) represent a grouping of just three commonly co-morbid and clinically-linked conditions: cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus. Another 21 plans represented a combination of cardiovascular disease and CHF. C\u2013SNPs have tended to focus on combinations of these three specific conditions since this policy was implemented. Considering the established clinical connection between these conditions and the interest among plans and beneficiaries, we propose to maintain the current list. We are proposing to codify this current list of combinations of chronic conditions that may be used by a C\u2013SNP at \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv)(A)(1) through (5). \nA C\u2013SNP may not be structured \naround multiple commonly co-morbid conditions that are not clinically linked in their treatment because such an arrangement results in a general market product rather than one that is tailored for a particular population. As part of its review, the 2019 clinical advisor panel convened in accordance with section 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act recommended the continuation of the current Chapter 16b linked conditions plus three additional groups. The panel considered a number of relevant factors, including all statutory criteria required under the Act, when determining the appropriateness of additional pairings, including clinical considerations and the potential of these conditions to be successfully managed by a specialized provider network. The panel recommended the following additional groupings conditions were as follows: \n\u2022Anxiety associated with COPD. \n\u2022CKD and post-renal organ \ntransplantation. \n\u2022Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and \nChronic and disabling mental health conditions. \nIn addition to our proposal to codify \nthe current approved set of commonly co-morbid and clinically-linked conditions, we propose to add the three \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00114 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "252849ed-4f97-4abd-b92a-5697c91bef20": {"__data__": {"id_": "252849ed-4f97-4abd-b92a-5697c91bef20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70f9fbe5-8d3d-451a-a308-7cfd2f8ec89c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f76d5fb699139ac0fc1bb0cf0b2f5decd875ac7667ab3135c2271f37d1ba7223"}, "3": {"node_id": "e545c6ce-c6e6-4569-ab47-0e7d75a36d7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fa30d7922622f023db6d361c8c979feac462fb27d9a2f6a12aa201c8d467b294"}}, "hash": "97f9b1b84f3f6f8b05825a7697c97d802cac6b1991b1d1a8c4699dd281756238", "text": "79565 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n148Table D\u2013A 1 was created using data from \nCMS\u2019 SNP Comprehensive Report, found here: \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and- \nSystems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/Special-Needs-Plan-SNP- Data.

Under this proposal, a C\u2013SNP may focus on one of the commonly co- morbid and clinically-linked conditions specified in these eight specific combinations of co-morbid condition groupings upon CMS approval. We are also proposing to add a new paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) at \u00a7 422.4 to clarify that enrollees need only have one of the qualifying conditions for enrollment listed in the approved groupings in proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B). This is consistent with current CMS operational practices regarding the current set of approved C\u2013SNP groups. We are seeking comment on our proposal to codify the current list of five commonly co-morbid and clinically-linked conditions. We are also seeking comment on the applicability of the proposed set of three new chronic condition pairs based on the chronic condition panel\u2019s recommendations. Second, we are also proposing to add at a new paragraph (g) at \u00a7 422.52 that SNPs may enroll eligible beneficiaries into a C\u2013SNP consisting of commonly co-morbid and clinically- linked conditions if the beneficiary has only one of the qualifying conditions for enrollment. \nLastly, CMS is not proposing to codify \na C\u2013SNP plan application option that is currently available under subregulatory guidance in section 20.1.3.2 of Chapter 16b of the MMCM. In effect, this will remove this approach as an option for C\u2013SNPs beginning 2024. Under the current guidance, we permit MA organizations seeking to sponsor a C\u2013 SNP to apply for an MA organization- customized group of multiple chronic conditions. If a C\u2013SNP uses such a customized group of conditions, enrollment in that C\u2013SNP is limited to special needs individuals who have all of the severe or disabling conditions in the group. CMS has reviewed only a few SNP plan application proposals since the initial implementation of the C\u2013SNP program and has not granted any applications either due to the lack of clinical connection between the proposed conditions or because the MA organization failed to meet other conditions of the application process. No C\u2013SNPs of this type have been approved nor will be operational in CY 2023. We are proposing to remove this option from the C\u2013SNP application process beginning in CY 2024. Given the historical lack of interest from MA organizations, beneficiaries, or patient advocacy groups, we believe there will be minimal impact on stakeholders associated with the elimination of this \ncurrent flexibility. In addition, with the addition of three new groupings and the ability to establish a C\u2013SNP that is based on functional limitations that we are proposing with paragraphs (20) through (21) of the proposed definition of severe or disabling chronic condition, we believe that there is adequate flexibility for MA organizations to develop C\u2013SNPs that meet the needs of the Medicare population. \nIn conclusion, we are proposing to \ndefine C\u2013SNPs at \u00a7 422.2 as SNPs that restrict enrollment to MA eligible individuals who have a severe or disabling chronic condition as defined under \u00a7 422.2.

This will provide greater clarity for MA organizations seeking to establish combination plans and for Medicare beneficiaries exploring potential MA plan options. We are seeking comment on these proposals. \nMany of the changes we are proposing \nin connection with C\u2013SNPs, including the revision of the definition of severe and disabling chronic condition and the new definition of C\u2013SNP, would unify and streamline existing requirements, which should reduce burden and are therefore not expected to have impact. The proposal regarding the definitions of severe or disabling chronic condition and C\u2013SNP and the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv) and 422.52 would be applicable beginning with plan year 2024. Together, these proposals would implement the new list of chronic conditions recommended by the panel of clinical advisors established by section 1859(f)(9)(A) of the Act. Our proposed update to the list would create new chronic condition categories, relabel several existing categories, and include several new sub-conditions \u2018\u2018under a number of chronic conditions. It is unclear how many MA organizations would create new C\u2013SNPs based on the proposed new list of severe or disabling chronic conditions that meet the criteria in section 1859 of the Act. Historically, MA organizations have generally focused plan and benefit efforts around a few specific chronic conditions. As reflected on Table D\u2013A 1, \nC\u2013SNPs based on just three conditions make up 63 percent of all C\u2013SNPs created since 2007: Cardiovascular \nDisorders, Chronic Heart Failure, and Diabetes Mellitus.\n148Given this \nhistorical pattern, we expect that MA organizations may be slow or hesitant to create new C\u2013SNP plan type options around the new set of chronic conditions. \nWe anticipate that changes from \ncurrent plan and enrollment practices would most likely be seen in connection with chronic condition categories like ESRD, where the proposal would somewhat revise enrollment qualifications. Based on the proposal to use the condition category \u2018\u2018Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\u2019\u2019 and to include ESRD as part of that condition category, we expect that current ESRD C\u2013SNPs will be permitted to enroll, in addition to those with ESRD, beneficiaries with CKD Stages 1\u20134 once this proposal is finalized. As of July 2022, CMS contracts with 17 C\u2013SNPs for ESRD. CMS estimates that just under 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries qualify for one of the stages of CKD; however, this figure includes beneficiaries who may already qualify for an ESRD C\u2013SNP in their area.\n149 \nHowever, we have no clear evidence to suggest how this will impact enrollment for current ESRD plans potentially impacted by this proposal or new C\u2013 SNPs that would be created because of it. \nBecause MA organizations would be \nable to choose to create and submit a C\u2013 SNP under one of the new chronic condition categories starting in CY 2024 (with the exception CKD as proposed in section IV.A.1. of this proposed rule), we do not see this as a new burden.

Defining Institutional Special Needs Plans and Codifying Beneficiary Protections (\u00a7 422.2) \nInstitutional Special Needs Plans (I\u2013 \nSNPs) are MA special needs plans (SNPs) that restrict enrollment to MA- eligible individuals who are institutionalized or institutionalized- equivalent as those terms are defined in \u00a7 422.2. Institutionalized is defined, for the purposes of defining a special needs individual and for the open enrollment period for institutionalized individuals at \u00a7 422.62(a)(4), as an MA eligible individual who continuously resides or is expected to continuously reside for 90 days or longer in one of the following long-term care facility settings: skilled nursing facility (SNF) as defined in section 1819 of the Act (Medicare); nursing facility (NF) as defined in section 1919 of the Act (Medicaid); \nintermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities as defined in section 1905(d) of the Act; psychiatric hospital or unit as defined in section 1861(f) of the Act; rehabilitation hospital or unit as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act; long- term care hospital as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act; hospital which has an agreement under section 1883 of the Act (a swing-bed hospital); and last, subject to CMS approval, a facility that is not listed as part of the definition of \u2018\u2018Institutionalized\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 422.2 but meets both of the following: furnishes similar long-term, healthcare services that are covered under Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, or Medicaid; and whose residents have similar needs and healthcare status as residents of one or more facilities listed in the definition of \n\u2018\u2018Institutionalized\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 422.2. We define, at \u00a7 422.2, the term \u2018\u2018institutionalized-equivalent,\u2019\u2019 for the purpose of identifying a special needs individual, as an MA eligible individual who is living in the community, but requires an institutional level of care; in addition, the definition of the term \n\u2018\u2018institutionalized equivalent\u2019\u2019 includes specific limitations on how an assessment is made that an individual meets the definition. \nPer the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108\u2013173), I\u2013SNPs, along with C\u2013SNPs and D\u2013SNPs, are MA plans that are specifically designed to provide targeted care and limit enrollment to special needs individuals.

As of February 2022, there are 87 I\u2013SNP MA contracts with 186 plans serving 96,792 enrollees.\n150CMS currently \npermits MA organizations to submit SNP applications that are restricted to institutionalized individuals only or institutionalized-equivalent individuals only, as defined in \u00a7 422.2 respectively, or to submit an application for a combination SNP that covers beneficiaries who qualify for either institutionalized or institutionalized- equivalent status, but are enrolled under the same plan. \nWe propose to add four definitions at \n\u00a7 422.2: a definition of I\u2013SNPs and three additional definitions for each of the current I\u2013SNP types that correspond to CMS\u2019 current MA application process. In addition, we propose to codify, as part of the definitions for I\u2013SNPs that enroll special needs individuals who are institutionalized, current policies that address the need for the I\u2013SNP to contract with the institutions where such special needs individuals reside. We believe that adding these four definitions will help clarify the specific standards that are applicable to I\u2013SNPs, as distinguished from other MA plans and from other MA SNPs. This proposal includes tying the definitions of institutionalized and institutionalized- equivalent in \u00a7 422.2 and the list of eligible institutions set forth in that definition, to our proposed definition of I\u2013SNP. This approach is consistent with how CMS has adopted regulatory definitions for D\u2013SNPs, FIDE SNPs, and HIDE SNPs in \u00a7 422.2. The proposed definitions clarify that MA organizations may offer SNPs that are: exclusive to beneficiaries meeting the definition of institutionalized under \u00a7 422.2; are exclusive to beneficiaries meeting the definition of institutionalized-equivalent under \u00a7 422.2; or are exclusive to beneficiaries who meet either of those definitions.

This proposed new paragraph (f)(2)(vi) would codify longstanding subregulatory guidance in section 20.3 of Chapter 16b of the MMCM that is designed to provide I\u2013 SNPs enrollees protections regarding access to care coordination and communication between providers and I\u2013SNP staff. Under our proposal, I\u2013SNP clinical and care coordination staff may be employed by the MA organization offering the I\u2013SNP or under contract with the I\u2013SNP to furnish healthcare, clinical or care coordination services. CMS has received feedback in the past that institutional providers sometimes fail to share relevant information regarding an I\u2013SNP enrollee\u2019s health status or need for care or services with the I\u2013SNP staff. We intend that codifying this requirement for I\u2013SNP MOCs to ensure that the contracts between the I\u2013SNP and these institutions where I\u2013SNP enrollees reside include provisions allowing access for I\u2013SNP staff will protect beneficiaries. Our proposal would leave the details of how access to I\u2013SNP enrollees would be assured for I\u2013SNP staff but we intend the term \u2018\u2018access\u2019\u2019 to be interpreted broadly to encompass information sharing, admission to physical facilities to see enrollees, and other issues. We are seeking comment on whether the regulation text needs to more specifically address information sharing or other related issues. We believe that codifying this policy would improve transparency for stakeholders, improve care coordination and ensure the continuity of care for vulnerable beneficiaries. In the years since it was issued in 2016, we have used the I\u2013SNP guidance from section 20.3 of Chapter 16b to administer policies central to plan compliance and application review. In that time, I\u2013SNP enrollment has grown from 54,643 enrollees under 37 contracts and 79 plans to 96,792 enrollees being served by 87 I\u2013SNP MA contracts with 186 plans.\n151As of 2021, \nMedPAC shows that 72 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least one I\u2013SNP plan, up from 52 percent in 2017.\n152As MedPAC noted \nin its March 2013 report, I\u2013SNPs \nperform better than other SNPs and other MA plans on the majority of available quality measures for SNPs. MedPAC also noted in the same report that I\u2013SNPs had much lower than expected hospital readmission rates and scored just as well as D\u2013SNPs and C\u2013 SNPs on other measures.\n153From an \nadministrative standpoint, CMS has found I\u2013SNPs to be comparable to other SNPs when it comes to meeting compliance standards. \nSection 1859(f) of the Act includes \nadditional requirements for all types of specialized MA plans for special needs individuals and requirements specific to I\u2013SNPs. Per the current definition of specialized MA plan for special needs individuals in \u00a7 422.2, MA SNPs must all cover Part D benefits under part 423 for their enrollees. In addition, the definition of MA SNPs provides that these MA plans have been designated by CMS as meeting the requirements of an MA SNP as determined on a case-by- case basis using criteria that include the appropriateness of the target population, the existence of clinical programs or special expertise to serve the target population, and whether the proposal discriminates against sicker members of the target population. The proposed definition of the term \u2018\u2018institutional special needs plan (I\u2013SNPs)\u2019\u2019 uses the term \u2018\u2018specialized MA plan for special needs individuals\u2019\u2019 and therefore incorporates the requirements and limitations on SNPs that are included in that definition in \u00a7 422.2. Accordingly, we are proposing to define I\u2013SNPs as SNPs that restrict enrollment to MA eligible individuals who meet the definition of institutionalized and institutionalized-equivalent in this section. We are also proposing to include in our definition of I\u2013SNP that there are the following types: I\u2013SNP Institutionalized, I\u2013SNP Equivalent, and I\u2013SNP Hybrid. We believe this definition is consistent with our current guidance and operational practices involving I\u2013SNPs and Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in those plans such that this proposal represents a continuation of I\u2013SNP policies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01deff6a-08b5-455f-9977-a30705e0cc22": {"__data__": {"id_": "01deff6a-08b5-455f-9977-a30705e0cc22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efed684b-9219-41c6-9a41-5e7fe25e737c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1a88e59a712384ae170bfc69aa68afd2b29815e4a2a84464f46a4f4dfad110dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "b945f364-2b34-46fd-9ff7-a4391563da3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "af10040a72d7cafd1cc44f5318ca319fe47c626a60bf7bca172349f222f96377"}}, "hash": "f7a6526a9bb44c0f7b585174b391af11c2f330536934d6b23d379a3160464e6d", "text": "We are also proposing to define three \nI\u2013SNP types that are currently used by \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c807b24a-25aa-452d-b03d-736b08d7ba27": {"__data__": {"id_": "c807b24a-25aa-452d-b03d-736b08d7ba27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d54a8cda-0cb9-4088-b6cc-c8e4b5e5996d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cd201255f55f1cd449f2120f5eec1253c386dbd56f8e4b7b7a3325f65ab04957"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e8f0b3f-f5aa-478e-8cb5-e86b01c97f9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "120edb17a663245b85168b20a7ed12afea2955fe161fc27bbe99e6737a5cc841"}}, "hash": "92f24786e95de834d12f35b6b5439ef3f0186625ed03948e8fcd572b67a04f14", "text": "79568 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nCMS to operationalize MA applications \nand Medicare beneficiary enrollment into I\u2013SNPs.

Those special needs individuals are living in the community but require an institutional level of care, which is determined using assessment tools that meet requirement specified in the definition of the term institutionalized- equivalent. The determination that a Medicare beneficiary requires an institutional level of care (LOC) must be made using a State assessment tool from the State in which the individual resides and the LOC assessment must be conducted by an impartial party with the requisite knowledge and experience to accurately identify whether the beneficiary meets the institutional LOC criteria. CMS has interpreted the standard that the assessment be done by an impartial entity as requiring that the entity be other than the I\u2013SNP and that the I\u2013SNP cannot own or control the entity. CMS currently uses the IE\u2013SNP \ndesignation for operational purposes during the MA application review and approval process. \nWe are proposing a definition for a \nthird I\u2013SNP type called \u2018\u2018Hybrid Institutional Special Needs Plan.\u2019\u2019 HI\u2013 SNPs are I\u2013SNP type that restricts enrollment to both MA eligible individuals who meet the definition of institutionalized and MA eligible individuals who meet the definition of \ninstitutionalized-equivalent. For enrollees that meet the definition of institutionalized, the HI\u2013SNP must own or contract with at least one institution, as determined under the definition of institutionalized in this section, for each county within the plan\u2019s county-based service area; and must own or have a contractual arrangement with each institutionalized facility serving enrollees. In other words, we are proposing that HI\u2013SNPs meet the standards specified in the definitions of FI\u2013SNPs and HE\u2013SNPs since these hybrids serve both type of special needs individuals. CMS currently uses the HI\u2013 SNP designation for operational purposes during the MA application review process. \nCMS\u2019s current guidance for I\u2013SNPs in \nsection 20.3.4 of Chapter 16b of the MMCM addresses a number of requirements that the contract between the I\u2013SNP and the LTC facility must include in order for an I\u2013SNP to meet CMS compliance in addition to the requirement, proposed to be added to \u00a7 422.101(f)(2)(vi), that the I\u2013SNP model of care ensure that contracts with long- term care institutions (listed in the definition of the term institutionalized in \u00a7 422.2) contain requirements allowing I\u2013SNP clinical and care coordination staff access to enrollees of the I\u2013SNP who are institutionalized. Some of that guidance addressing an I\u2013 SNP\u2019s relationship with long-term care institutions is proposed to be included in the definitions for specific types of I\u2013 SNPs. We are not proposing to codify the remainder of the requirements listed in section 20.3.4 of Chapter 16b because they would duplicate requirements in other current MA regulations under part 422. Specifically, we believe the following standards described in section 20.3 are addressed or required by current regulations: \n\u2022Section 20.3.4 states that facilities \nin a chain organization must be contracted to adhere to the I\u2013SNP MOC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e8f0b3f-f5aa-478e-8cb5-e86b01c97f9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e8f0b3f-f5aa-478e-8cb5-e86b01c97f9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d54a8cda-0cb9-4088-b6cc-c8e4b5e5996d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cd201255f55f1cd449f2120f5eec1253c386dbd56f8e4b7b7a3325f65ab04957"}, "2": {"node_id": "c807b24a-25aa-452d-b03d-736b08d7ba27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "92f24786e95de834d12f35b6b5439ef3f0186625ed03948e8fcd572b67a04f14"}}, "hash": "120edb17a663245b85168b20a7ed12afea2955fe161fc27bbe99e6737a5cc841", "text": "Currently, requirements for compliance with and implementation of the I\u2013SNP\u2019s required model of care (MOC) by the LTC facilities and other providers that contract with the I\u2013SNP to furnish services to the I\u2013SNP\u2019s enrollees are addressed by \u00a7\u00a7 422.101(f)(2), 422.202 and 422.504. Currently, all SNPs are required under \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(iv) to submit their model of care (MOC) to CMS for National Commission on Quality Assurance (NCQA) evaluation and approval. All SNPs (including I\u2013 SNPs) are required by \u00a7 422.101(f)(2) to have appropriate employed, contracted, \nor non-contracted staff trained on the SNP plan MOC to coordinate and/or deliver all services and benefits; and in \naddition, SNPs must develop and implement model of care requirements to coordinate the delivery of care to their enrollees across healthcare settings, providers, and services to assure continuity of care. Per \u00a7 422.202, MA organizations are required to provide information about the rules of participation in the organization\u2019s network of providers and to have a mechanism for consulting with and communicating practice guidelines and utilization management guidelines to contracted providers. Finally, \u00a7 422.504(i) provides that MA organizations must include certain provisions and beneficiary protections in their contracts with first tier, downstream and related entities (which includes contracted providers), including compliance with Medicare laws and the MA organization\u2019s contractual obligations with CMS. Thus, we believe codifying this aspect of the existing guidance would be duplicative. We solicit comment from providers whether an additional regulation specific to this issue is necessary to further clarify the obligations of I\u2013SNPs. \n\u2022Section 20.3.3 provides that an I\u2013 \nSNP must document that it is prepared to implement the approved MOC when an enrollee changes residence or LTC facility that furnishes services to the I\u2013 SNP\u2019s enrollees. If an I\u2013SNP enrollee changes applicable facility status, the I\u2013 SNP must document that it is prepared to implement the approved MOC at the enrollee\u2019s new residence or in another I\u2013SNP contracted LTC setting that provides an institutional level of care. Again, we believe a regulation that is specific to this issue would be duplicative of existing regulations. All SNPs, including I\u2013SNPs, are required under \u00a7 422.101(f)(2)(ii) to have contracted staff trained on the MOC. In addition, per \u00a7 422.101(f)(1), SNPs must develop and implement individualized \nplans of care for enrollees and use interdisciplinary teams to manage and furnish care; we believe that in order to meet those obligations, an I\u2013SNP would necessarily have to involve and coordinate services with the long-term care facility (LTCF) where an enrollee receives services. \n\u2022Section 20.3.4 of Chapter 16b also \naddresses how: \n++ The I\u2013SNP must provide protocols \nto all LTCFs for serving the I\u2013SNP\u2019s enrollees in accordance with the approved I\u2013SNP MOC, and the contract with each LTCF must reference these protocols. \n++ The I\u2013SNP must clearly specify in \nits contract with the LTCF provider the services to be provided to I\u2013SNP \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af4183e9-4ca5-47fb-8867-b969cef1e20a": {"__data__": {"id_": "af4183e9-4ca5-47fb-8867-b969cef1e20a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1bd4289a-2537-45a4-887e-3530e61dc341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dd51b5c3105338d961d256cf204424f67b64d0c4a6c26e1f036500617ac4d679"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3f77d69-0736-412f-b472-92dcb6dbf4b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "364182715d9e4d62ee3e6f11a9376642f3355b76da263c22e462d26a684891f7"}}, "hash": "eadc6089c05d489b98036f38799209292e8f633dab2b3be43f2d7e040397b4d8", "text": "79569 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nenrollees by the LTCF and its staff, in \naccordance with the protocols and payment for the services provided by each LTCF. The I\u2013SNP must include in its contract with the LTCF provider a training plan to ensure that LTC facility staff understands their responsibilities in accordance with the approved I\u2013SNP MOC, protocols, and contract. If the training plan is a separate document, then the contract should reference it. \nLike the other issues previously \ndiscussed, these actions are required in order for an I\u2013SNP to meet their obligations to coordinate and implement the approved MOCs and to maintain effective oversight over first tier, downstream and related entities involved in the furnishing of covered benefits to enrollees under \u00a7\u00a7 422.101(f) and 422.504. We believe additional regulations that are specific to how \u00a7\u00a7 422.101(f) and 422.504 work together in this context would be unnecessary and duplicative. \n\u2022Section 20.3.4 provides that I\u2013SNPs \nmust develop procedures for LTCFs to maintain a list of credentialed I\u2013SNP clinical staff in accordance with the LTC facility\u2019s responsibilities under Medicare conditions of participation. Per \u00a7 422.204(b)(2), MAOs must follow a documented process with respect to providers and suppliers who have signed contracts or participation agreements in meeting the initial credentialing and recredentialing requirements. In addition, per \u00a7 422.204(b)(3), the I\u2013SNP can only contract with a LTCF (which is a provider of services as that term is defined in section 1861(u) of the Act) for furnishing Part A and B benefits when the facility has a Medicare participation agreement, which would include the obligations to comply with conditions of participation in 42 CFR part 483. We believe that an additional regulation that specifies that I\u2013SNPs must include in their contracts with LTCFs that the LCTFs comply with their Medicare conditions of participation would be unnecessarily duplicative. \n\u2022Section 20.3.4 of Chapter 16b \nprovides that I\u2013SNPs must ensure that the contract between the I\u2013SNP and the LTCF where enrollees of the I\u2013SNP reside must specify the start and end date of the contract; the guidance also states that the contract should include \nthe full CMS contract cycle, which begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. The I\u2013SNP may also contract with additional LTC facilities throughout the CMS contract cycle. To the extent that this guidance goes beyond requirements in \u00a7 422.504(i), we do not believe that it is necessary to adopt a regulation to require these specific contract terms for I\u2013SNPs and \ntheir contracted LTCFs. The proposed definitions for the I\u2013SNPs that serve beneficiaries that are institutionalized would require those MA plans to have contracts with the LTCFs where enrollees reside and with LTCFs in the service area; in order to meet these requirements during the full term of the I\u2013SNP\u2019s contract with CMS, those contracts would necessarily have to cover the full January through December time frame. We do not believe that a more detailed regulation governing the terms of contracts between I\u2013SNPs and LTCFs on this point is necessary. \n\u2022Finally, section 20.3.4 of Chapter \n16b provides that the contract between the I\u2013SNP and the LTCF include a termination clause that clearly states any grounds for early termination of the contract and a clear plan for transitioning the enrollees to another facility where the I\u2013SNP can furnish covered benefits should the I\u2013SNP\u2019s contract with the LTC facility terminate. In addition, a transition plan would only be necessary if the beneficiary elects to continue enrollment with the I\u2013SNP rather than elect enrollment in a different MA plan or Original Medicare. Further, we note that a beneficiary who remains in the terminated facility or who transfers to another non-contracted facility would lose eligibility for enrollment in their current I\u2013SNP. Section 422.504(i) requires MA organizations to include in their contracts with first tier, downstream and related entities provisions that address termination and scope of the activities to be performed by the contracted entity; this regulation applies to contracts between the MA plan and providers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3f77d69-0736-412f-b472-92dcb6dbf4b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3f77d69-0736-412f-b472-92dcb6dbf4b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1bd4289a-2537-45a4-887e-3530e61dc341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dd51b5c3105338d961d256cf204424f67b64d0c4a6c26e1f036500617ac4d679"}, "2": {"node_id": "af4183e9-4ca5-47fb-8867-b969cef1e20a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eadc6089c05d489b98036f38799209292e8f633dab2b3be43f2d7e040397b4d8"}}, "hash": "364182715d9e4d62ee3e6f11a9376642f3355b76da263c22e462d26a684891f7", "text": "In addition, SNPs are required to implement the MOC under \u00a7 422.101(f) with appropriate networks of providers and specialists designed to meet the specialized needs of the plan\u2019s targeted enrollees and to have individualized plans of care for each enrollee; ensuring the continued delivery of services during a period of transition would necessarily have to be addressed in implementation of the MOC and plans of care. Therefore, we are not proposing an additional regulation to codify this aspect of our current guidance. \nThe changes that we are proposing \ncarry no burden. We are proposing definitions of I\u2013SNP and I\u2013SNP types under \u00a7 422.2 to clarify existing policies that are specific to I\u2013SNPs and not general policies impacting D\u2013SNPs or C\u2013SNPs. This proposal is also a codification of several specific \nlongstanding subregulatory guidance in Chapter 16b of the MMCM. We believe there is no burden associated with \neither pieces of our proposal, as the creation of a definition will not engender operational or policy changes impacting MA organizations sponsoring I\u2013SNPs nor impact enrollees; likewise, we do not expect any burden associated with the continuation of existing guidance that was incorporated and implemented with the release of the 2016 update of Chapter 16b of the MMCM. \nWe are seeking comment on the \nproposed codification of chapter 16b subregulatory guidance and the proposed new definition of I\u2013SNP. In particular, we are seeking feedback on I\u2013SNP operationalization of the current subregulatory guidance. We also seek feedback from commenters who have other suggestions for improving the care furnished to the special needs individuals enrolled in I\u2013SNPs, many of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, based on parallels or lessons learned from other State or Federal programs administering services to long-term care residents or beneficiaries requiring a nursing home level of care. \nC. Definition of Network-Based Plan \n(\u00a7\u00a7 422.2 and 422.114) \nThis proposed revision would move \nthe current definition of a network- based plan from \u00a7 422.114(a)(3)(ii) to the definitions section in \u00a7 422.2. This proposed change has no implications for other provisions in part 422 in which the definition or description of network plans play a role, for example, the network adequacy provisions at \u00a7 422.116 and the plan contract crosswalk provisions at \u00a7 422.530. Currently, \u00a7 422.116(a)(1)(i) references the current definition of network-based plan at \u00a7 422.114(a)(3)(ii) in its specification of network adequacy requirements for the various plan types. \nWe propose to make, however, a conforming change to \u00a7 422.116(a)(1)(i) consistent with our proposal to move the definition of network-based plan; this conforming change is to reference \u00a7 422.2. The regulation at \u00a7 422.530(a)(5) specifically addresses the types of plans to which it applies and when CMS considers a crosswalk to be to a plan of a different type, so we do not believe any amendment to \u00a7 422.530 is necessary in connection with moving the definition of network based plan to \u00a7 422.2. \nPrivate-fee-for-service (PFFS) plans \nwere established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and were originally not required to have networks.

For purposes of this requirement, section 1852(d)(5)(C) of the Act and \u00a7 422.114(a)(3)(ii) define network-based plans as a coordinated care plan (as described in section 1851(a)(2)(A) of the Act and \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(ii)), a network-based MSA plan, and a section 1876 reasonable cost plan. The statutory and regulatory definitions both specifically exclude an MA regional plan that meets access requirements substantially through means other than written contracts, per \u00a7 422.112(a)(1)(ii). \nWhen codifying this requirement in \nthe final rule that appeared in the Federal Register September 18, 2008 titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Revisions to the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019, (73 FR 54226), we included the definition of network-based plan in the section of the regulations for PFFS plans, as the definition was integral to the new requirement for PFFS plans. (73 FR 54230, 54249) A network-based plan, however, has meaning in contexts other than in addressing these specific requirements for MA PFFS plans and, in order to ensure that the definition is more readily accessible for those seeking requirements related to network-based plans, we are proposing to move it to the definitions section at \u00a7 422.2. The PFFS section at \u00a7 422.114(a)(3)(ii) would continue to include language specifying the network requirement, but the proposed conforming change to this section would refer to the definitions in \u00a7 422.2 instead of including the definition in \u00a7 422.114(a)(3)(ii). \nD. Required Notices for Involuntary \nDisenrollment for Loss of Special Needs Status (\u00a7 422.74) \nSection 231 of the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003 (MMA) amended section 1851(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act to establish specialized MA plans for special needs individuals. Special needs plans (SNPs), defined at section 1859(b)(6)(A) of the Act, are plans with \nlimited enrollment, specifically designed to provide targeted care to institutionalized individuals, dual eligible individuals, or individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions, collectively known as a \u2018\u2018special needs individual\u2019\u2019 as defined at section 1859(b)(6)(B) of the Act. Only those individuals who qualify as special needs may enroll, and remain enrolled, in a SNP. In the January 2005 MA final rule, we established regulations at \u00a7 422.52 that provided that to be eligible \nto enroll in a SNP, an individual must meet the definition of a special needs individual, meet the eligibility requirements for that specific SNP, and be eligible to elect an MA plan. Sections 1859(b)(6)(B) and 1894(c)(4) of the Act, and CMS\u2019s implementing regulation at \u00a7 422.52(d), allow individuals who lose special needs status, if, for example, they were to no longer have the level of Medicaid eligibility or other qualifying condition necessary to be eligible for the plan, to have a period of deemed continued eligibility if they are reasonably expected to regain special needs status within, at most, the succeeding 6-month period. The period of deemed eligibility must be at least 30 days but may not be longer than 6 months. In implementing regulations, we also established loss of special needs status (and of deemed continued eligibility if applicable) as a basis for required disenrollment at \u00a7 422.74(b)(2)(iv). \nThe January 2005 MA final rule \nserved as the basis for our current sub- regulatory guidance in Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, Section 50.2.5, which specifically provides that plans send certain notices prior to and following the effective date of involuntary disenrollment based on loss of special needs status. These policies are intended to ensure that beneficiaries are given adequate notice prior to being disenrolled from a SNP and provided an opportunity to prove that they are eligible to remain enrolled in the plan, if applicable. Providing these members at least 30 days advance notice of disenrollment, along with information about deemed continued eligibility and eligibility for an SEP to elect other coverage, gives beneficiaries ample time to prove they are still eligible for their SNP or to evaluate other coverage options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9ef30e5-68db-4850-8acd-7613c6ce50fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9ef30e5-68db-4850-8acd-7613c6ce50fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f7de4a8-6b15-429a-8606-f45178ba9534", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "412d72823febc5eb68ada29ae21ff4094a2972d5c98a4c9ae7abedd4413e66bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab7db617-b3c8-4a77-8259-1662d5df17b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "97d7a02d7a14d212c31bbb9853d4acb19aded0f299744c1f27ae6aded08835a2"}}, "hash": "d62530c54fb68d944a6c7067a32a73b67549de31fe427840d42a1975eaa809d5", "text": "To provide stability and assurance \nabout the requirements for MA organizations in these situations as well as transparency to stakeholders, we are proposing to codify current policy for MA plan notices prior to a member\u2019s disenrollment for loss of special needs status, as well as a final disenrollment notice. We intend that stakeholders will be able to rely on these regulations, and that these regulations would only be changed through a subsequent rulemaking, establishing the procedures that an MA organization must follow in the event that a SNP enrollee loses special needs status and is disenrolled from the SNP on that basis. Specifically, we are proposing to revise \u00a7 422.74(d) \nby redesignating paragraph (d)(8) as paragraph (9) and adding new paragraph (8), to state that the plan would be \nrequired to provide the enrollee a minimum of 30 days advance notice of disenrollment, regardless of the date of the loss of special needs status. As proposed in new paragraphs (8)(i) and (ii), an advance notice would be provided to the enrollee within 10 calendar days of learning of the loss of special needs status, affording the enrollee an opportunity to prove that he or she is still eligible to remain in the plan. The advance notice would also include the disenrollment effective date, a description of SEP eligibility, as described in \u00a7 422.62(b)(11), and, if applicable, information regarding the period of deemed continued eligibility, the duration of the period of deemed continued eligibility, and the consequences of not regaining special needs status within the period of deemed continued eligibility. Additionally, as proposed in new paragraph (8)(iii), the plan would be required to provide the enrollee a final notice of involuntary disenrollment within 3 business days following the disenrollment effective date, which is either the last day of the period of deemed continued eligibility, if applicable or a minimum of 30 days after providing the advance notice of disenrollment, and must be sent before submission of the disenrollment to CMS. Lastly, we propose in new paragraph (8)(iv), that the final involuntary disenrollment notice must include an explanation of the individual\u2019s right to file a grievance under the MA organization\u2019s grievance procedures, which are required by \u00a7 422.564. \nWe are codifying longstanding \nguidance with these changes. Based on infrequent questions or complaints from MA organizations and enrollees on these notices, we believe that these notice requirements have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by plans. We do not believe the proposed changes to the regulatory text will adversely impact MA organizations or individuals \nenrolled in MA special needs plans who lose special needs status, other than the appropriate disenrollment from the plan due to the individual\u2019s loss of eligibility for the plan. Similarly, we do not believe the proposed changes would have any impact to the Medicare Trust Funds. \nE.

As enacted, section 1851(a)(2)(B) of the Act established the authority for an MA organization to offer a MA medical savings account (MSA) option which is, a combination of a high-deductible MA plan, as defined in section 1859(b)(3) of the Act, with a contribution into a Medical Savings Account (MSA). \nIn the interim final rule titled \nMedicare Program; Establishment of the Medicare+Choice Program,\u2019\u2019 published in the Federal Register June 26, 1998 (63 FR 34968), we established the conditions for MA organizations to enroll individuals in a MA MSA plan. The restrictions on enrollment in MA MSA plans were set forth under section 1851(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Act and in implementing regulations at \u00a7 422.56. Specifically, consistent with section 1851(b)(2) of the Act, \u00a7 422.56(b) provides that an individual who is enrolled in a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB) plan, or is eligible for health care benefits through the Veterans Administration (VA) or the Department of Defense (DoD), may not enroll in a MA MSA plan. In addition, \u00a7 422.56(c) incorporates the statutory prohibition under section 1851(b)(3) of the Act on enrollment in MA MSA plans by individuals who are eligible for Medicare cost-sharing under Medicaid State plans. Additional restrictions were set forth under section 1852(a)(3)(B) of the Act and in implementing regulations at \u00a7 422.56(d) based on supplemental benefits under an MA MSA plan. \nThe January 2005 MA final rule \nimplemented section 233 of the Medicare Modernization Act, which lifted the time and enrollment limits on MSA plans imposed by the BBA of 1997. However, section 233 of the MMA did not alter the prohibitions in sections 1851(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Act on enrollment into an MA MSA plan for individuals covered under other health programs, and likewise the January 2005 \nMA final rule did not alter the implementing regulations regarding these policies at \u00a7 422.56. \nThe current regulations do not specify \nwhether the eligibility criteria described in \u00a7 422.56, which preclude an individual with certain health care coverage from electing an MA MSA plan, are applicable to individuals who gain or become eligible for other coverage while enrolled in an MSA plan. \nIn other words, the current regulations \ndo not specify that an individual who ceases to satisfy the eligibility criteria described in \u00a7 422.56 while already enrolled in an MA MSA plan must be involuntarily disenrolled from the MSA, regardless of the time of year. CMS has historically understood the eligibility criteria for an individual to be enrolled in an MSA plan in \u00a7 422.56, coupled with the statutory prohibitions on enrolling in an MA MSA by individuals with Medicaid or coverage under other health benefits, to mean that an enrollee in an MSA plan is not able to remain a member of the MSA plan and must be disenrolled by the plan when the individual ceases to meet the statutory and regulatory criteria for eligibility. We also note that this policy is consistent with our general approach in section 50.2, Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, in which an enrollee becomes ineligible due to a status change, such as the loss of entitlement to Medicare Part A or Part B or the inability to regain special needs status during the period of deemed continued eligibility and outlined in \u00a7 422.74. \nTo address more clearly the \nconsequences of the general loss of eligibility in an MSA plan, we are proposing to amend \u00a7 422.74 to add new paragraph (b)(2)(vi) to include the requirement that an MA MSA enrollee must be disenrolled, prospectively, due to the loss of eligibility.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22b6049a-fabb-4e13-b215-7fa9b4dc6231": {"__data__": {"id_": "22b6049a-fabb-4e13-b215-7fa9b4dc6231", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fb36f97-a219-41bf-9014-643f84037438", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cae3214e0c50871584fa9f1327a69359e0869eaf09f6d2dce85f51312801d95e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1527b1a9-993b-4b7b-aeb0-29da2dd753ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9e88007bd8dbf89c0631e8e879f68a72f0680b2560dc08276ca44e0b95250370"}}, "hash": "d553af1e03dbf38ec4d5a7b089bde4e4aa73f6ef96cacc0bdaf01eb80c7ec180", "text": "If an MA MSA enrollee does not provide assurances that he or she will reside in the United States for at least 183 days during the year the election is effective, is eligible for or begins receiving health benefits through Medicaid, FEHBP, DoD, or the VA or obtains other health coverage that covers all or part of the annual Medicare MSA deductible, that enrollee must be involuntarily disenrolled by the MSA plan effective the first day of the calendar month after the month in which notice by the MA organization is issued that the individual no longer meets the MA MSA\u2019s eligibility criteria, as proposed in \u00a7 422.74(d)(10). We are also proposing to revise \u00a7 422.74(c) to require MA MSA plans to provide a written notice of the disenrollment with an explanation of why the MA organization is planning to disenroll the individual before the disenrollment transaction is submitted to CMS. \nShould an individual\u2019s coverage \nunder an MA MSA plan end before the end of a calendar year, CMS recovers from the plan the amount of the lump- sum deposit attributable to the \nremaining months of that year. This requirement is codified at \u00a7 422.314(c). In addition, the disenrolled beneficiary \nwill owe a prorated portion of the current year\u2019s deposit amount back to the MA MSA plan. Plans will be able to reconcile and identify MSA deposit amounts for the Current Payment Month (CPM) at the beneficiary-level from the monthly generated MSA Deposit- Recovery Data file. We are proposing at \u00a7 422.74(e)(1) that involuntarily disenrolled individuals will be defaulted to enrollment in Original Medicare, which will now pay claims incurred by the former MSA enrollees. Conversely, the former MSA enrollee also has the option to elect to join another MA plan during a valid enrollment period. \nF. Codification of Special Needs Plan \nModel of Care Scoring and Approval Policy (\u00a7 422.101) \nCongress first authorized special \nneeds plans (SNPs) to exclusively or disproportionately serve individuals with special needs through passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the MMA) (Pub. L. 108\u2013173). The law authorized CMS to contract with Medicare Advantage (MA) coordinated care plans that are specifically designed to provide targeted care to individuals with special needs. Originally SNPs were statutorily authorized for a limited period, but after several extensions of that authority, section 50311(a) of the BBA of 2018 permanently authorized SNPs. Under section 1859(f)(1) of the Act, SNPs are able to restrict enrollment to Medicare beneficiaries who are: (1) Institutionalized individuals, who are currently defined in \u00a7 422.2 as those residing or expecting to reside for 90 days or longer in a long-term care facility, and institutionalized equivalent individuals who reside in the community but need an institutional level of care when certain conditions are met; (2) individuals entitled to medical assistance under a State plan under Title XIX; or (3) other individuals with certain severe or disabling chronic conditions who would benefit from enrollment in a SNP. As of July 2022, 492 SNP contracts with 1,198 SNP plans had at least 11 members. These figures included 307 Dual Eligible SNP contracts (D\u2013SNPs) with 729 D\u2013SNP plans with at least 11 members, 87 Institutional SNP contracts (I\u2013SNPs) with 186 I\u2013SNP plans with at least 11 members, and 98 Chronic or Disabling \nCondition SNP contracts (C\u2013SNPs) with 283 C\u2013SNP plans with at least 11 members.

L. 110\u2013275) added care management requirements for all SNPs effective January 1, 2010, which are in section 1859(f)(5)(A) of the Act. As a result, all SNPs are required to implement care management requirements which have two explicit components: an evidence-based model of care (MOC) and a series of care management services. For more discussion of the history of SNPs, please see Chapter 16b of the Medicare Managed Care Manual (MMCM). \nThis proposed rule would codify \ncertain subregulatory guidance from Chapters 5 and 16b of the MMCM about current SNP MOC scoring protocols; annual C\u2013SNP MOC submissions as required by the BBA of 2018; and processes for amending SNP MOCs after National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) approval. \n1. Codification of Model of Care (MOC) \nScoring Requirements for Special Needs Plans (SNPs) (\u00a7 422.101) \nSection 3205 of the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act) (Pub. L. 111\u2013148) amended section 1859(f) of the Act to require that, starting in 2012, all SNPs be approved by NCQA based on standards developed by the Secretary. As provided under \u00a7\u00a7 422.4(a)(iv), 422.101(f), and 422.152(g), the NCQA approval process is based on evaluation and approval of \nthe SNP MOC. In the final rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, which appeared in the Federal Register on January 12, \n2021 (hereinafter referred to as the January 2021 final rule), we adopted several regulatory amendments to implement requirements for the SNP MOC that were enacted as part of the BBA of 2018 and our extension of some C\u2013SNP-specific standards to all SNP MOCs. \nAll SNPs must submit their MOCs to \nCMS for NCQA evaluation. An MA organization sponsoring multiple SNPs must develop a separate MOC to meet the needs of the targeted population for each SNP type it offers. MA organizations that wish to offer a SNP must submit an application (under part 422, subpart K) to demonstrate that they meet SNP specific requirements, \nincluding the requirement in \u00a7 422.101(f) that MA organizations offering a SNP implement an evidence- based MOC to be evaluated by the NCQA; the requirement in \u00a7 422.107 that D\u2013SNPs have a contract with the State Medicaid agencies in the states in \nwhich they operate; and the requirement in \u00a7 422.152(g) that SNPs conduct quality improvement programs. SNP applicants follow the same process in accordance with the same timeline as applicants seeking to contract with CMS to offer other MA plans. Most recently, in the January 2021 final rule, CMS revised and amended \u00a7 422.101(f) to improve plan implementation of enrollee care management practices and to strengthen the review process by establishing a minimum benchmark score of 50 percent for each element of a plan\u2019s MOC (\u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii)). \nSince the beginning of the MOC \napproval process, CMS has developed and issued guidance on the MOC to improve plan performance and beneficiary care. CMS provided guidance and instructions in the CY 2010 Final Call Letter issued March 30, 2009, in a section titled, \u2018\u2018Model of Care Reporting for New Applicants and Existing SNPs,\u2019\u2019 in order to more clearly establish and clarify delivery of care standards for SNPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1681b69c-7af2-47bb-8e96-63b192a1235a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1681b69c-7af2-47bb-8e96-63b192a1235a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53dcdf5e-bd85-4c1d-9405-1e24b0aedccb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bb49ee4ad9156fab3a07fd77c58ff0ccea7af20b87e1de245f9186e18d2d4f43"}, "2": {"node_id": "56525eca-e861-4cff-bfdb-540514e12473", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d6c8756847e37a40b5259b14c3507a62bce38bdd1d0f972dd5b37e77617eebd1"}}, "hash": "fd67d5f12b0503b354861b26390ecceb514b492903629f61efb180378bbf8aad", "text": "154In May, 2008, \nCMS proposed that SNPs have networks with clinical expertise specific to the special needs population of the plan; use performance measures to evaluate models of care; and be able to coordinate and deliver care targeted to people with frailty or disability, and those near the end of life based on appropriate protocols. (73 FR 28555, 28559) Section 164 of the MIPPA subsequently added care management requirements for all SNPs in an amendment to section 1859(f)(5) of the Act, outlining new requirements for an evidence-based model of care that include\u2014(1) an appropriate network of providers and specialists to meet the specialized needs of the SNP target population; (2) a comprehensive initial health risk assessment (HRA) and annual reassessments; (3) an individualized plan of care containing goals and measurable outcomes; and (4) an interdisciplinary team to manage care. The MIPPA amendments to section 1859(f)(5) of the Act laid a statutory foundation for much of our regulatory standards for the model of care. In the September 2008 interim final rule with comment (73 FR 54226, 54228) and the January 2009 final rule (74 FR 1493, 1498), we finalized standards for the required model of care at \u00a7 422.101(f). \nMOCs are a vital quality improvement \ntool and integral component for ensuring that the unique needs of each beneficiary enrolled in a SNP are identified and addressed. As we noted in the May 2008 proposed rule, CMS deliberately structured its guidance toward the conceptual framework of a MOC without being prescriptive about the specific staff structure, provider network, clinical protocols, performance improvement, and communication systems. We expected SNPs to develop a MOC structure that allowed plans to develop care plans that addressed differing needs among members of the plan. For example, a C\u2013SNP targeting diabetes mellitus may enroll a member with diabetic complications who is near the end of life and might require assisted living or institutional services for which the SNP would develop different goals, expanded specialty services and facilities in their provider network, different performance measures, and additional protocols that would inappropriate for enrollees in the C\u2013SNP who have less severe health complications. \nIn addition to the requirements in \n\u00a7 422.107(f) for the MOC, CMS has issued guidance over the years, for both NCQA\u2019s use in reviewing and approving MOCs and SNPs\u2019 use in developing and implementing their MOCs. We believe that, in practice, MOCs are consistent with the existing guidance. The MOC is organized to promote clarity and enhance the focus on care coordination, care transition, care needs and activities. It is a vital quality improvement tool and integral component for ensuring that the unique needs of each enrollee are identified by the SNP and addressed through the plan\u2019s care management practices. The NCQA review and approval process is based on scoring each of the clinical and non-clinical elements of the MOC. Each element is comprised of a set of required subcomponents, or factors, such as an identification and comprehensive description of the SNP-specific population. These subcomponents are reviewed and scored by NCQA and contribute to the overall score for that element. A full list of elements and factors is in Chapter 5 of the MMCM.

We are proposing here to codify the SNP MOC scoring protocols by amending \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii) to include the current subregulatory scoring protocols. This proposal, and these scoring protocols, \nalign with the minimum benchmark for each element of the SNP MOC of a plan that is currently reflected at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii), as added by the January 2021 final rule. Our adoption of these scoring standards is authorized by section 1859(f)(7) of the Act for NCQA review and approval to be based on standards established by the Secretary and our authority in section 1856(b) of the Act to establish standards to carry out the MA program. \nFirst, we are proposing to amend \n\u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii) to add the minimum overall score requirement for approval of a SNP\u2019s MOC, using the term aggregate minimum benchmark; we are proposing to use the same minimum standard for the aggregate minimum benchmark as is currently used by NCQA in reviewing and approving MOCs. Currently, SNP MOCs are approved for 1, 2, or 3-year periods. Each element of the SNP\u2019s submitted MOC is reviewed and scored. As provided in \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii), the minimum benchmark for each element is 50 percent. The MOC is scored by NCQA based on the review of four elements: Description of the SNP Population; Care Coordination; SNP Provider Network; and MOC Quality Measurement & Performance Improvement. Each of these four elements has a number of sub-elements and factors to address the necessary scope and detail of the MOCs. Currently, each of the four SNP model of care elements is valued at 16 points. The aggregate total of all possible points across all elements equals 64, which is then converted to percentage scores based on the number of total points received. CMS provides additional information regarding MOC scoring criteria in Section 20.2.2 of Chapter 5 of the MMCM. In addition to the current element-level minimum benchmark regulatory requirement at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii), SNPs are also required to meet a minimum benchmark score for the aggregate total\u2014otherwise known as the aggregate minimum benchmark. Currently, the aggregate minimum benchmark is 70 percent of the total 64 points. We are proposing to codify this current practice by amending \n\u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii) to add that, in addition to the current requirement that all SNPs must meet a minimum benchmark score of 50 percent on each element, each SNP\u2019s MOC must meet an aggregate minimum benchmark of 70 percent. As reflected in the proposed revision to paragraph (f)(3)(iii), a SNP\u2019s model of care will only be approved if each element of the model of care meets the minimum benchmark and the entire model of care meets the aggregate minimum benchmark. \nSecond, we are proposing regulation \ntext to address the period of approval for the MOCs that meet the aggregate minimum benchmark. We are proposing to codify at \u00a7 422.107(f)(3)(iii)(A) the requirement, from section 1859(f)(5)(B) of the Act, that C\u2013SNP MOCs are annually reviewed and evaluated. Beginning in 2020, under the MOC review process, C\u2013SNPs are only eligible to receive a MOC approval for 1-year and therefore are subject to annual review and approval processes. Specifically, we are proposing at paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) to codify that an MOC for a C\u2013SNP that receives a passing score is approved for 1 year. We do not propose to apply the requirement for annual review and approval to the MOCs of all D\u2013SNPs and I\u2013SNPs. Instead, we are proposing, at new paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B), to codify different approval permits for the MOCs of I\u2013SNPs and D\u2013SNPs that is based on the final score of the MOC on the aggregate minimum benchmark.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b0396b8-27f5-46a7-b3f7-0f5c2b2f3f7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b0396b8-27f5-46a7-b3f7-0f5c2b2f3f7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5584486-7ca4-496c-b4eb-2357f0043d7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8fc1f5f4588e1484f942218b43ab1b604601adf97b3d05ebdd4dd0cb5d28d902"}, "2": {"node_id": "26065f35-f44e-4b15-9741-3a265a5f7c8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "102d1cdb4912160e3e89a1ec96ccaa8b088a9c7a9d159f9df1d9aa0bbc567c8d"}}, "hash": "0e28229d00f59840e9a1762c6c1b8d04602b131c86515caa0be047965ddc7cac", "text": "We are proposing that: (1) an MOC for an I\u2013SNP or D\u2013SNP that receives an aggregate minimum benchmark score of 85 percent or greater is approved for 3 years; (2) an MOC for an I\u2013SNP or D\u2013 SNP that receives a score of 75 percent to 84 percent is approved for 2 years; and (3) an MOC for an I\u2013SNP or D\u2013SNP that receives a score of 70 percent to 74 percent is approved for 1 year. This proposed scoring process matches the current process NCQA uses to score initial and annual MOCs. We believe it is prudent to maintain the current scoring process as it has worked well to incentivize improvements in MOCs and strikes a balance with respect to the burden associated with reviews and approvals for all stakeholders by allowing higher scoring MOCs remain in place longer. \nThird, we are proposing a new \nparagraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) to provide an opportunity for a SNP to cure deficiencies in its MOC if the MOC fails to meet the minimum element benchmark or the aggregate minimum \nbenchmark when reviewed and scored by NCQA. Currently, the review and evaluation process includes a second \nopportunity to submit an initial or renewal MOC, known as \u2018\u2018the cure process.\u2019\u2019 Regardless of the final score by NCQA of an MOC resubmitted using the cure process (provided the MOC has the minimum scores to be approved), SNPs that need to use the cure process to reach a passing aggregate minimum and/or minimum element benchmark score will receive only a 1-year approval under this proposal. This policy provides added incentive for SNPs to develop and submit comprehensive and carefully considered MOCs for initial NCQA approval and rewards those SNPs that have demonstrated ability to \ndevelop quality MOCs without requiring additional time. We are proposing that the opportunity to cure deficiencies in the MOC is only available once per scoring cycle for each MOC. Under this proposal, a MA organization that fails to meet either the minimum element benchmark for any MOC element or the aggregate minimum benchmark for the entire MOC after having an opportunity to cure deficiencies will not have its MOC approved. MOCs that do not receive NCQA approval after the cure review will not have a third opportunity for review. As a result, the SNP(s) that use that MOC would need to be nonrenewed by the MA organization or terminated by CMS for failure to meet a necessary qualification for SNPs. \nWe reiterate that this proposal would \nmaintain the current scoring criteria and review process. We believe this proposal creates no additional burden to SNPs, as current MOCs are evaluated based on this criterion already. We welcome comment on the codification of existing MOC scoring requirements for SNPs. These new regulations would be applicable for MOCs reviewed for contract year 2024 and we will continue our current practice pending a final rule. \n2. Amending SNP MOCs After NCQA \nApproval \nCMS is proposing to codify current \npolicies and procedures for an MA organizations to amend its MOCs after NCQA approval.

Call Letter.156Currently, a D\u2013SNP or I\u2013 \nSNP that decides to make substantive \nrevisions to their existing approved MOC may submit a summary of their off-cycle MOC changes, along with the red-lined MOC, in the Model of Care module in HPMS for NCQA review and approval. Substantive revisions are those that have a significant impact on care management approaches, enrollee benefits, and/or SNP operations. MOC changes are at the discretion of the applicable MA organization offering the SNP and it is the responsibility of the MA organization to notify CMS of substantive changes and electronically submit their summary of changes to their MOC in HPMS. Beginning with CY 2020, C\u2013SNPs are required to submit MOCs annually, and thus, their MOCs \nreceive approvals for a period of one- year. Upon implementation the annual review and approval of C\u2013SNP MOCs, C\u2013SNPs were not permitted to submit a revised MOC through an off-cycle submission. \nAt the time of the CY 2016 Final Call \nLetter, based on our previous experience with the small number of SNPs seeking to amend their MOCs, we expected that mid-cycle amendments to MOCs would be relatively rare and CMS did not anticipate that the off-cycle process would result in a higher incidence of such MOC changes. We believed that only relatively unusual circumstances would require SNPs to make changes to their MOCs that are so significant that notification to CMS and review of the changes to the MOC would be warranted. However, CMS and NCQA have seen the number of off-cycle MOC submissions steadily rise over the past four years and plans have expressed frustration and confusion over what plan changes merit or require submission to NCQA for an off-cycle approval. This proposed rule is intended to address stakeholder feedback regarding the off-cycle review process and to mitigate the SNP community\u2019s concerns regarding continued plan burden in this area. \nIn general, CMS intends the MOC \nreview and approval process to include an MA organization\u2019s submission of a MOC only in the following scenarios: the MA organization seeks to offer a new SNP; the MA organization\u2019s SNP\u2019s MOC approval period ends; or CMS deems revision and resubmission of the MOC necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable standards and requirements, such as a change in applicable law or when CMS discovers a violation. For the last scenario, an off- cycle MOC submission may be necessary if during an audit, it appears that the MOC (including in practice as the SNP applied the MOC) is not meeting applicable standards, then CMS may ask the SNP to correct and resubmit the MOC. Other examples include regulatory changes or when a State Medicaid agency requires changes to the MOC of a D\u2013SNP to meet State-specific requirements. In order to ensure a stable care management process and to ensure appropriate oversight by CMS of SNPs and their operation, SNPs may not implement any changes to a MOC until NCQA has approved the changes. Based on our experience, additional situations may justify the submission of a revised MOC for review and approval. This proposal would establish when an MA organization may submit updates and corrections to its approved MOC. \nFirst, we are proposing to codify the \noff-cycle process at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv). We propose that MA organizations offering SNPs that need to revise their MOC mid-cycle during their MOC approval period may submit the revised MOC for review by NCQA at specific times. CMS has historically restricted the period that SNPs can submit an off- cycle submission from June 1st to November 30th of any contract year, which is meant to allow for the efficient and prudent administration of the annual initial and review MOC process\u2014with the exception of C\u2013SNPs who are prohibited from submitting off- cycle submissions because of the requirement that plans submit their MOC annually. However, CMS has also allowed SNPs to submit off-cycle MOCs outside of this window when CMS deems it necessary to ensure the SNP or its MOC was meeting statutory or regulatory requirements, guarantee the safety of enrollees, or meet State Medicaid requirements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5493682-b7dd-47a0-8668-33cb7768cffb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5493682-b7dd-47a0-8668-33cb7768cffb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f4e7178-b6ff-47c8-a589-284337666341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b1c6ad1b3c13c348aeb1ddc8785181be95f23ffe4413504f1865fd5a68f6d1bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0e71b5f-b34b-4e18-b2ec-b4463ca897be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2a6418c0462b493cfbbdd85184fd3e68b156e79f24e916f6d69a228ba55ac7fa"}}, "hash": "7f5e130f504baf55508ca5f7d3bbef1d72d89a8a5181881f4e655f0b8c1ee275", "text": "We propose to maintain this process and codify it at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(A). We propose that SNPs may submit updates and corrections to their NCQA-approved MOC between June 1st and November 30th of each calendar year or when CMS deems it necessary to ensure compliance with applicable standards and requirements. We intend the phrase \u2018\u2018applicable standards and requirements\u2019\u2019 to encompass the situations described here in the preamble or similar situations where a potential or existing violation needs to be addressed. To ensure consistent application of this standard and demonstrate our intent that these be limited situations where a revision is truly necessary, the proposed regulation text is clear that CMS will make this determination and provide directions to the MA organization. If an MA organization believes that this standard in which revision is necessary to ensure compliance by the SNP and its MOC, we anticipate that the MA organization will contact CMS for guidance and approval to submit a revision. \nSince the beginning of the off-cycle \nsubmission process, CMS has attempted to provide guidance clarifying which MOC changes require submission to CMS and how SNPs should submit their MOC changes to CMS. We have said in the past that SNPs that make significant changes to their MOCs must submit (in HPMS) a summary of the pertinent modifications to the approved MOC and a redlined version of the approved MOC with the revisions highlighted. Given the level of questions we have received over the years regarding what constitutes a significant change, we are proposing to codify a list of reasons for when a SNP must use an off-cycle submission of a revised MOC for review and approval. Proposed \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(B) provides that an MA organization must submit updates or corrections to a SNP\u2019s MOC to reflect the following: \n\u2022Changes in policies or procedures \npertinent to: \n++ The health risk assessment (HRA) \nprocess; \n++ Revising processes to develop and \nupdate the Individualized Care Plan (ICP); \n++ The integrated care team process; \n++ Risk stratification methodology; or ++ Care transition protocols; \u2022Target population changes that \nwarrant modifications to care \nmanagement approaches or changes in benefits. For example, we intend this to include situations like adding Diabetes to a Cardiovascular Disease and Congestive Heart Failure C\u2013SNP; \n\u2022Changes in a SNP\u2019s plan benefit \npackage between consecutive contract years that can considerably impact critical functions necessary to maintain member well-being and are related SNP operations. For example, changes in Medicaid services covered by a HIDE SNP or FIDE SNP through its companion Medicaid managed care plan or changes in Medicaid policy (such as benefits or eligibility) that require changes to an ICP for coordinating Medicare and supplemental benefits with the new Medicaid policy; \n\u2022Changes in level of authority or \noversight for conducting care coordination activities (for example, medical provider to non-medical provider, clinical vs. non-clinical personnel); \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89d4acec-4221-4460-8940-552dba84ce08": {"__data__": {"id_": "89d4acec-4221-4460-8940-552dba84ce08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a91ffbe-4d5f-4317-ac68-ae6444f2dd89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b20d8ae9bdb547f2008dd55d32737ece99b1c3bb8bcfc785c22122f575ebcd8b"}, "3": {"node_id": "d30c2d24-014f-4ec1-9fd4-1a106f296941", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f238654ce3803835be3bf220ec12b12ad7563b7162f37a941f9d36548a5236e9"}}, "hash": "18ed439537c434116293da533f6f959c1d20494fde437cc5d59aec6fae41e65f", "text": "79575 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n\u2022Changes to quality metrics used to \nmeasure performance. \nThe proposed regulation text does not \ninclude immaterial examples of the type \nand scope of MOC policy changes that may be made by an MA organization to the SNP\u2019s approved MOC without any review or approval by CMS or NCQA.

In addition, NCQA will continue to review the summary of changes and a redlined copy of the revised MOC submitted in HPMS to verify that the revisions are consistent with the previously detailed list of applicable submissions and in line with acceptable, high-quality standards, as included in the original, approved MOC. The revised MOCs will not be rescored. Further, the MOC\u2019s original approval period (that is, 1-year or multi- year) will not be modified as a result of NCQA\u2019s approval of the changes. We propose to codify this policy at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(E), which provides that the successful revision of the MOC under proposed (f)(3)(iv) does not change the MOC\u2019s original period of approval by NCQA. Therefore, changes made to MOC cannot be used to improve a low score. We anticipate that the current procedures and documentation processes will continue; such procedures and operational practices do not need to be in regulation text. CMS may change procedures as necessary (for example, use of HPMS as the system for submission, the mechanism for providing notice to MA organizations of the review of the MOC initially or any revisions, etc.). We intend that the current procedures will continue for NCQA reviewers to \ndesignate the summary as \u2018\u2018Acceptable\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Non-Acceptable,\u2019\u2019 and enter the findings in the HPMS character text box. Similarly, we will continue the current process in which a system-generated email is sent to the designated SNP Application Contact and the MA Quality Contact, as well as to the individual who submitted the revised MOC summary. Lastly, we are proposing under \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(F) to codify existing operational practices with respect to off-cycle submissions by C\u2013SNPs. Currently, C\u2013SNPs are prohibited from submitting off-cycle MOC submissions, as all C\u2013SNPs submit MOCs annually as required under section 1859(f)(5)(B)(iv) of the Act. We are proposing to codify that C\u2013SNPs are prohibited from submitting an off-cycle MOC submission except when CMS requires an off-cycle submission to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations. C\u2013SNPs must wait until the annual MOC submission period to make changes to their MOC. \nSNPs have one opportunity to correct \n(\u2018\u2018cure\u2019\u2019) deficiencies, as noted in our proposed rule \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii)(C) to confirm that the revised MOC is consistent with the standards outlined in the original MOC.

The proposed MOC off-cycle cure process at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv) differs from the review and scoring process being codified \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii). The review process employed under \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iii) provides a one-time cure process. Likewise, the cure process proposed (and under current operational use by NCQA) would allow D\u2013SNPs and I\u2013SNPs to resubmit a single revised off-cycle submission or cure until the end of the Off-cycle submission period to an Off-cycle MOC that was deemed unacceptable during the off-cycle review process. We are proposing to codify this policy of a single cure opportunity during the off- cycle time period under a new paragraph at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(G) \nWe have also found that SNPs have \nsought to modify an initial or renewal \nMOC shortly after NCQA approval and before the MOC has gone into effect. We \nhave generally rejected these submissions because the MOC has yet to go into effect. We will continue to prohibit an off-cycle submission until the approved MOC has gone into effect. For example, if NCQA approved a SNP\u2019s MOC on April 1, 2022, the plan would be prohibited from submitting an off- cycle submission until the effective date of the MOC, which would be January 1, 2023. \nIn order clarify this process, we are \nproposing to codify this guidance at \u00a7 422.101(f)(3)(iv)(C). We propose that NCQA will only review off-cycle submissions after the start of the effective date of the current MOC unless it is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations or State Medicaid agency requirements for D\u2013SNPs. Finally, we reiterate that we still believe that off- cycle submissions to substantively revise an MOC should be a rare occurrence rather than an eventuality. We believe that these proposed processes and procedures will make certain that CMS and NCQA are apprised of up-to\u2013date information regarding the MOC; strengthen our ability to adequately monitor the approved MOCs; and guarantee that SNPs continue to provide high quality care to enrollees. We seek comment on the codification of the current off-cycle MOC submission process. \nThe proposed regulations described \nhere reflect and would codify current policy and procedures. While this proposed rule as a whole is generally intended to be applicable beginning with contract year 2024, we intend to continue our current policy as reflected here. We also believe the following proposed changes carry no burden. This proposal is a codification of previously issued subregulatory guidance in Chapter 5 and other CMS transmittals to impacted MA organizations. More importantly, the current proposed codification is already captured under the PRA package \u2018\u2018Initial and Renewal Model of Care Submissions, and Off- cycle Submission of Summaries of Model of Care Changes (CMS\u201310565, OMB 0938\u20131296). As part of the PRA approval package, CMS reviews public comments directed towards the initial \nand renewal MOC process, MOC trainings, and the off-cycle MOC submission system. Again, the burden effort associated with this proposed rule covering the latter items is captured in the currently approved MOC PRA. \nBased on our experience monitoring \nSNPs and engaging in the process for review and approval of MOCs, we believe plans are following the our \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e57cce24-4ab0-4672-8fbf-9e4c60e7ebe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e57cce24-4ab0-4672-8fbf-9e4c60e7ebe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a578c98-4fe0-4164-a98a-1c7c612479d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cb7e2614b90f0db0294ab47d3d166664a5756a356cc2f542587bed3ef57fc5fe"}, "3": {"node_id": "43641af4-74d9-4c69-9a37-2764779a1b03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6f85dbd91a224410891c0e7d15e2b6ade7ec432343d3ff6bfc016015b47cc453"}}, "hash": "67297f4a1219c8c5b1e8dc9c14a1d3bc0d44426012d3f30f43ada723f6605e9b", "text": "79576 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n157The Advance Notice of Methodological \nChanges for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare \nAdvantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 draft Call Letter discusses the clinical trial coverage policy for the MA program on pages 23\u201323 and is available at this link: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ \nMedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/ Advance2019Part2.pdf. \n158The Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) \n2011 Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and Part D Payment Policies and Final Call Letter addresses this in a response to a comment on page 20\u201321 and is available at the following link: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/ Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Announcement2011.pdf. 159In addition, the See page 31 of the MA \nPayment Guide for Out of Network Payments, page \n31, addresses this topic.

Clinical Trial-Related Provisions \n(\u00a7\u00a7 422.101 and 422.109) \nMA plans must cover Medicare Part A \nand Part B benefits, excluding hospice, kidney acquisitions for transplant, and certain changes in benefits due to a National Coverage Determination (NCD) or a legislative change. We are proposing to adopt regulations regarding MA coverage of clinical trials covered by Medicare to ensure clarity on these coverage rules for MA plans. These coverage rules implement section 1852 of the Act and are within our rulemaking authority for the MA program. These proposals generally codify guidance currently specified in section 10.7 of Chapter 4 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for clinical trials covered under National Coverage Determination (NCD) 310.1; A and B investigational device trials (A\u2013B IDE); and National Coverage Determinations with coverage with \nevidence development (NCD\u2013CED). \n1. Clinical Trials Under National \nCoverage Determination 310.1 \nClinical trials may include some items \nand services that would not be covered by Medicare, absent the trial. For clinical trials covered under the Clinical Trials National Coverage Determination 310.1 (NCD) (NCD manual, Pub. 100\u201303, Part 4, section 310), longstanding CMS policy has been that traditional Medicare (that is, the Medicare FFS program) covers the routine costs of qualifying clinical trials for all Medicare enrollees who volunteer to participate in the approved trial, including those enrolled in MA plans. CMS has discussed this policy in several Advance Notices and Rate Announcements, including the advance notices of methodological changes in Part C payments issued for 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2017, and 2019, and in the announcements of capitation rates and payment policies for Part C in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2017. NCD 310.1 is the current statement of the Medicare coverage of routine costs associated with clinical trial participation. As specified in the NCD, routine costs associated with a clinical trial include: \n\u2022Items or services that are typically \nprovided by Medicare absent a clinical trial (for example, conventional care); \n\u2022Items or services required solely for \nthe provision of the investigational item or service (for example, administration of a noncovered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinically appropriate monitoring of the effects of the item or service, or the prevention of \ncomplications; and \n\u2022Items or services needed for \nreasonable and necessary care arising from the provision of an investigational item or service in particular, for the diagnosis or treatment of complications. \nAlthough MA plans must follow all \nNCDs, section 1852(a)(5) of the Act, which CMS has implemented in \u00a7 422.109(b), provides that if an NCD or new legislative benefit introduced in the middle of a plan year is considered a significant cost as determined by the Office of the Actuary, MA plans are not responsible for coverage until the cost to provide the new benefit is calculated into the plan\u2019s payment rate. CMS has previously determined, as discussed in the CY 2019 Advance Notice,\n157that the \nmultiple clinical trials covered under NCD 310.1 trigger the significant cost threshold.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43641af4-74d9-4c69-9a37-2764779a1b03": {"__data__": {"id_": "43641af4-74d9-4c69-9a37-2764779a1b03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a578c98-4fe0-4164-a98a-1c7c612479d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cb7e2614b90f0db0294ab47d3d166664a5756a356cc2f542587bed3ef57fc5fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "e57cce24-4ab0-4672-8fbf-9e4c60e7ebe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "67297f4a1219c8c5b1e8dc9c14a1d3bc0d44426012d3f30f43ada723f6605e9b"}}, "hash": "6f85dbd91a224410891c0e7d15e2b6ade7ec432343d3ff6bfc016015b47cc453", "text": "Therefore, traditional Medicare has covered the Medicare- covered routine costs of clinical trials that are covered under NCD 310.1 for MA enrollees. To ensure continued clarity and transparency for this longstanding policy, discussed in section 10.7.1 of Chapter 4 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, we are proposing to codify this policy by \nadding new \u00a7 422.109(e). In \u00a7 422.109(e)(1), we propose to codify that traditional Medicare is responsible for coverage of routine costs of qualifying clinical trials for MA enrollees for clinical trials covered under the Clinical Trials National Coverage Determination 310.1 and all reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications from participating in clinical trials. \nDeductibles and MA Responsibility for \nDifferences in Cost-Sharing \nTraditional Medicare pays for all \nroutine costs of clinical trials for MA enrollees and, as explained in the CY 2011 Rate Announcement,\n158MA \nenrollees do not pay the traditional Medicare Part A and B deductibles when the traditional Medicare pays the Medicare-covered costs associated with \nthe clinical trial.\n159In \u00a7 422.109(e)(2), \nwe propose to codify this policy that MA enrollees participating in clinical trials are not subject to Part A and B deductibles. \nMA plans are responsible for paying \nthe difference between traditional Medicare cost-sharing incurred for qualifying clinical trial items and services and the MA plan\u2019s in-network cost-sharing for the same category of items and services. We propose to codify this requirement for MA plans to pay the difference between traditional Medicare and plan\u2019s cost sharing in \u00a7 422.109(e)(3). We also propose in \u00a7 422.109(e)(4) to codify that the enrollee\u2019s in-network cost-sharing portion must be included in the plan\u2019s maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) calculation. As the clinical trial costs within the scope of NCD 310.1 are covered by Part A and/or Part B, these are basic benefits within the scope of the MOOP requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 422.100(f)(4) and (5) and 422.101(d)(2) and (3) but for clarity we are proposing to codify at \u00a7 422.109(e)(4) the requirement that the enrollee\u2019s in-network cost-sharing must be included in the plan\u2019s MOOP calculation. In requiring MA organizations to provide in-network cost sharing for clinical trial services, CMS is requiring that MA plan members have coverage for clinical trial services that is consistent with coverage they have for all other Medicare Part A and Part B services. In paragraph (e)(5), consistent with our guidance in section 10.7.1 of Chapter 4 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, we would specify that MA plans may not require prior authorization for participation in a Medicare-qualified clinical trial not sponsored by the plan, nor may it create impediments to an enrollee\u2019s participation in a non-plan-sponsored clinical trial under NCD 310.1. This protection is necessary in order to ensure that MA enrollees have access to and coverage of clinical trials within the scope of NCD 310.1 to the same extent as Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the traditional Medicare program. While MA plans are responsible for covering any differences in cost-sharing between traditional Medicare and MA plan in- network costs for services in the same category, traditional Medicare, through the MACs, is responsible for all other costs included in clinical trials within \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "805e4f91-5969-4799-a6ee-d3ef34b28a69": {"__data__": {"id_": "805e4f91-5969-4799-a6ee-d3ef34b28a69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd428388-f3d2-499c-b734-c29a91fc08a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ffb6b3198c7253f7a991e1cfc8ebcc8809a2ef298d2b5c8644ae723a875ce12c"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f3ed517-0560-48bf-92f0-042c74f87cde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "16e37420b01c27e88d46f5d438f492ffc930d63478ca853c14a71ff365e9d8bd"}}, "hash": "d3f0d2634a751c30ead0a985e5e6a0b7c7577c89176b54a2d928a9bfad07eae5", "text": "79577 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nthe scope of NCD 310.1. Finally, in \naccordance with \u00a7 422.109(c)(2), CMS requires MA organizations to provide coverage for: 1) services to diagnose conditions covered by clinical trial services; 2) most services furnished as follow-up care to clinical trial services; and 3) services already covered by the MA organization. Because \u00a7 422.109(c) adequately addresses how MA organizations are required to cover certain benefits and costs even when the traditional Medicare program pays for changes in benefits as a result of an NCD or legislative change, we do not believe that additional regulation text is necessary to apply those rules in the context of NCD 310.1. \n2. A\u2013B Investigational Device \nExemption Trials \nThe regulation at \u00a7 405.211 specifies \nMedicare coverage of Category A and B investigational device exemption (IDE) studies. Providers of device trials must submit approval for the devices from the FDA, as part of their application to CMS for approval of a trial. Once a trial has been approved by CMS, it is listed on the CMS website. In addition to including assessment of devices, IDE trials differ from clinical trials under NCD 310.1, as they are not covered as a result of an NCD nor are they subject to a significant cost assessment. As a result, MA organizations are responsible for payment of claims related to enrollees\u2019 participation in both Category A and B IDE studies that are covered under traditional Medicare. This is part of the MA organization\u2019s obligation to cover the items and services (other than hospice care or coverage for organ acquisitions for kidney transplants) for which benefits are available under Parts A and B for their enrollees under section 1852 of the Act. \nMA plans are responsible for payment \nof routine care items and services in \nCMS-approved Category A and Category B IDE studies. An MA plan is also responsible for coverage of CMS- approved Category B devices. While CMS will cover routine care items and services, it will not approve coverage of Category A devices themselves because they are considered experimental and excluded from coverage under \u00a7 405.211(a). As with other benefits for which it is responsible for coverage, an MA plan may apply utilization management, including prior authorization, consistent with \u00a7 422.4(a)(1)(ii). \nSection 10.7.2 of Chapter 4 of the \nMedicare Managed Care Manual addresses this policy. In order to clarify this scope of required coverage for MA plans and avoid any inadvertent confusion between the coverage \nrequirements associated with clinical trials under NCD 310.1, we propose to add \u00a7 422.109(f) to specify MA plan coverage of the routine items and services, including the Category B IDE device and related items and services in the context of a Category A and B IDE studies, that are covered by Medicare under \u00a7\u00a7 405.211(a) and (b). \n3. National Coverage Determinations \nWith Coverage With Evidence Development \nSection 1852(a)(1) of the Act requires \nMA plans to cover all Medicare Part A and Part B benefits, subject to limited exclusions. One of those exclusions relates to new NCDs that result in significant cost increases, making it clear that benefits covered under an NCD are included in what MA plans must cover. In addition, \u00a7 422.101(b)(1) explicitly requires MA plans to cover NCDs. (See section III. E. of this document, Utilization Management Requirements, for more information on CMS\u2019 proposal to address MA plan coverage obligations.) NCDs generally provide guidance about coverage of new benefits, update an existing benefit or, in some cases, specify that a procedure or service is not covered. As with other Part A and B benefits (aside from hospice and the cost of kidney acquisition for transplant), MA plans must cover NCDs. This is true for NCDs that also have a trial or registry component that is required as part of the coverage, which is explained in section 10.7.3 of Chapter 4 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual. This is referred to as \u2018\u2018coverage with evidence development\u2019\u2019 (CED), as authorized under the statute at 1862(a)(1)(E). CED is a paradigm whereby Medicare covers items and services on the condition that they are furnished in the context of CMS approved clinical studies or with the collection of additional clinical data (for example, registry).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f3ed517-0560-48bf-92f0-042c74f87cde": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f3ed517-0560-48bf-92f0-042c74f87cde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd428388-f3d2-499c-b734-c29a91fc08a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ffb6b3198c7253f7a991e1cfc8ebcc8809a2ef298d2b5c8644ae723a875ce12c"}, "2": {"node_id": "805e4f91-5969-4799-a6ee-d3ef34b28a69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d3f0d2634a751c30ead0a985e5e6a0b7c7577c89176b54a2d928a9bfad07eae5"}}, "hash": "16e37420b01c27e88d46f5d438f492ffc930d63478ca853c14a71ff365e9d8bd", "text": "A list of NCD\u2013CEDs with the coverage protocol for each is available at: https://www.cms.gov/ Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with- Evidence-Development. \nWe are merely reiterating here that \nMA plans must cover NCDs with CED \nand are not proposing a change in policy. We solicit comment whether additional regulations are needed to address NCDs with CED; we believe that \u00a7 422.101(b) is sufficient that these NCDs are within the scope of the traditional Medicare benefits that MA plans must cover and that additional regulations are unnecessary.

CMS is including this discussion here to make clear that significant cost requirements apply to all new NCDs, that is, that the significant cost assessment includes NCDs with CED. The thresholds for significant cost are specified in \u00a7\u00a7 422.109(a)(1) and (a)(2). The assessment generally applies to each NCD or legislative change in benefits that occurs after the rate announcement for a contract year such that the change in costs was not incorporated into the capitation rates for the contract year. Costs are estimated for a particular NCD or legislative change in benefits so the thresholds specified in \u00a7\u00a7 422.109(a)(1) and (a)(2) apply to each NCD or legislative change in benefits rather than to the aggregate number of such changes over the course of a contract year. \nH. Required Notice for Reinstatements \nBased on Beneficiary Cancellation of New Enrollment (\u00a7\u00a7 422.60 and 423.32) \nSections 1851(c)(1) and 1860D\u20131(b)(1) \nof the Act establish the enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change in coverage processes for MA and PDP plans. In the June 1998 interim final rule, we established the M+C (now MA) \nenrollment process (63 FR 34968). These requirements are codified in regulation at \u00a7 422.60. In the January 2005 Part D final rule, we established the PDP enrollment process (70 FR 4193). These requirements are codified in regulation at \u00a7 423.32. \nSection 1851(g)(3)(B)(i) of the Act \nprovides that MA plans may terminate the enrollment of individuals who fail to pay basic and supplemental premiums on a timely basis; likewise, section 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(v) of the Act directs the Secretary to use rules similar to (and coordinated with) the rules for an Medicare Advantage plan established under section 1851(g) of the Act. CMS has previously codified this process of optional disenrollment from an MA plan or PDP for failure to pay monthly premiums at \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(d) and 423.44(d), as well as requirements for mandatory disenrollment for individuals who fail to pay the Part D Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (Part D\u2013 IRMAA), where applicable, at \u00a7 423.44(e).

We established at \u00a7 422.66(b)(1) that an individual is disenrolled from their MA plan when they elect a different MA plan; likewise, at \u00a7 423.36(a), an individual is disenrolled from their PDP plan when they enroll in a different PDP plan. Sub- regulatory guidance requires MA and PDP plans to provide notification of enrollment reinstatement based on a beneficiary\u2019s cancellation of a new enrollment in a different plan. This guidance is currently outlined in the Part C and Part D sub-regulatory guidance found in section 60.3.2 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual and section 60.2.2 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, respectively. \nTo provide transparency and stability \nfor stakeholders, we are proposing at new \u00a7\u00a7 422.60(h) and 423.32(h) to require that MA and PDP plans must notify an individual when the individual\u2019s enrollment is reinstated due to the individual\u2019s cancellation of enrollment in a different plan. A reinstatement is generally not allowed if the individual intentionally initiated a disenrollment and did not cancel the disenrollment prior to the disenrollment effective date. However, when a beneficiary is automatically disenrolled from their plan because of enrollment in a new plan but then cancels the request to enroll in the new plan within established timeframes, the associated automatic disenrollment from the previous plan becomes invalid. Therefore, the beneficiary\u2019s enrollment in the previous plan needs to be reinstated and CMS systems will attempt to automatically reinstate enrollment in the previous plan. Consistent with notification requirements in similar enrollment scenarios, we propose that the organization from which the individual was disenrolled send the member notification of the enrollment reinstatement within 10 days of receipt of Daily Transaction Reply Report \n(DTRR) confirmation of the individual\u2019s reinstatement. The reinstatement notice would include confirmation of the individual\u2019s enrollment in the previous plan with no break in coverage, plan- specific information as needed, and plan contact information. \nThese proposed changes represent the \ncodification of longstanding guidance. Based on infrequent complaints and questions from plans and beneficiaries \nrelated to current requirements, we conclude that the requirements have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by plans. There is also no impact to the Medicare Trust Fund. \nI. Part D Plan Failure To Submit \nDisenrollment Timely (\u00a7 423.36) \nSection 1860D\u20131(b) of the Act \nestablishes the disenrollment process for Part D eligible individuals in prescription drug plans. This section of the Act grants the Secretary the authority to establish a process for the enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change of enrollment of Part D eligible individuals in prescription drug plans. In 2005, the implementing regulations at 70 FR 4525 established the voluntary disenrollment process for Part D prescription drug plans. These requirements are codified in regulation at \u00a7 423.36 and require the Part D sponsor to \u2018\u2018submit a disenrollment notice to CMS within timeframes CMS specifies.\u2019\u2019 \nAs previously noted, section 1860D\u2013 \n1(b)(1)(B) of the Act directs the Secretary to adopt enrollment rules \u2018\u2018similar to (and coordinated with)\u2019\u2019 the rules established under Part C. In 1998 implementing regulations for Part C, CMS provided that if a \u2018\u2018Medicare + Choice\u2019\u2019 (M+C) organization, later known as an MA organization, fails to submit the correct and complete notice of disenrollment, the M+C organization must reimburse the Health Care Finance Administration (the predecessor to CMS), for any capitation payments received after the month in which payment would have ceased if the requirement had been met timely (63 FR 35071). This requirement was codified at \u00a7 422.66(b)(4) and has remained in place for MA organizations.

If the retroactive disenrollment request is approved, the PDP sponsor must return any premium paid by the member for any month for which CMS processed a retroactive disenrollment, and CMS will retrieve any capitation payment for the retroactive period for an approved \nrequest for retroactive disenrollment, as described in section 60.4 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. To provide transparency and consistency for stakeholders, and align the Part D regulation with the requirements for MA organizations, we propose to codify CMS\u2019s longstanding sub-regulatory guidance by amending \u00a7 423.36 to add a new paragraph (f) to reflect that if the Part D sponsor fails to submit a disenrollment notice to CMS timely as required by \u00a7 423.36(b)(1), such that the Part D sponsor receives additional capitation payments from CMS, the Part D sponsor must reimburse CMS for any capitation payments received after the month in which payment would have ceased if the requirement had been met timely. \nThis proposal is a codification of \nlongstanding Part D sub-regulatory guidance and there is no impact to the Medicare Trust Fund.

In addition, section 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that in establishing a process for Part D enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change of enrollment of Part D eligible individuals in prescription drug plans, the Secretary shall use rules \nsimilar to (and coordinated with) the rules for an Medicare Advantage (MA)\u2014 formerly M+C\u2014plan established under section 1851(c) of the Act. \nThe June 1998 final regulation \nestablished the process for individuals to voluntarily disenroll from an MA plan.

Specifically, at \u00a7 422.66(b)(2) we provide that a disenrollment request is considered to have been made on the date the disenrollment request is received by the MA organization. Once received, the MA organization is required to send the disenrollment notice to CMS and a copy to the enrollee which informed the enrollee of any lock-in requirements of the plan that apply until the effective date of disenrollment.

These requirements were codified at \u00a7 423.36. \nHowever, \u00a7\u00a7 422.66(b) and 423.36 do \nnot address what plans should do in the event that they receive incomplete disenrollment requests. CMS has historically provided the procedural steps for plans to address incomplete disenrollment requests, in section 50.4.2, Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual and section 50.4.2, Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, including providing that when the disenrollment request is incomplete, plans must document its efforts to obtain information to complete the request; and if any additional information needed to make the disenrollment request \u2018\u2018complete\u2019\u2019 is not received within prescribed timeframes, the plan must deny the disenrollment request. \nTo provide transparency and stability \nfor stakeholders about the MA and Part D programs and about the requirements applicable to requests for voluntary disenrollment from MA and Part D plans, we are proposing to codify CMS\u2019s longstanding policies in this area at new paragraphs \u00a7 422.66(b)(6) and 423.36(d) that a disenrollment request is considered to be incomplete if the required but missing information is not received by the MA plan or Part D sponsor within the specified timeframes in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.66(b)(3)(v)(C) and 423.36(b)(4)(iii), as described in this rule. We are also proposing at new paragraphs \u00a7\u00a7 422.66(b)(3)(v) and 423.36(b)(4) that if the disenrollment request is incomplete, the plan must document its efforts to obtain information to complete the election. Plans would be required to notify the individual (in writing or verbally) within 10 calendar days of receipt of the disenrollment request. For incomplete \ndisenrollment requests received by plan sponsors during the annual election period (AEP), we are proposing information to complete the request must be received by December 7, or within 21 calendar days of the plan sponsor\u2019s request for additional information, whichever is later. For all other election periods, we are proposing that required information must be \nreceived by the end of the month in which the disenrollment request was initially received, or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information, whichever is later. Finally, we are proposing that if any additional information needed to make the disenrollment request complete is not received within these timeframes, the disenrollment request must be denied. \nWe are codifying longstanding \nguidance with these changes. All information impacts related to the procedural steps plans must take to address incomplete disenrollment requests have already been accounted for under OMB control numbers 0938\u2013 0753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267) for Part C and 0938\u2013 0964 (CMS\u201310141) for Part D. Based on infrequent questions from MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors as these requirements have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by plans, we conclude that these updates do not add to the existing disenrollment process and we do not believe there is any additional paperwork burden. \nK. Reinstatement of Enrollment for Good \nCause (\u00a7\u00a7 417.460, 422.74 and 423.44) \nAs previously noted, sections \n1851(g)(3)(B)(i) and 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(v) of the Act provide that MA and Part D plans may terminate the enrollment of individuals who fail to pay basic and supplemental premiums on a timely basis. In addition, section 1860D\u2013 13(a)(7) of the Act mandates that individuals with higher incomes pay an additional premium, the Part D IRMAA, for the months in which they are enrolled in Part D coverage. \nConsistent with these sections of the \nAct, the MA and Part D subpart B regulations set forth our requirements with respect to involuntary disenrollment procedures under \u00a7\u00a7 422.74 and 423.44, respectively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "126cf5fd-202d-4ef2-8532-b45d2ceb4b31": {"__data__": {"id_": "126cf5fd-202d-4ef2-8532-b45d2ceb4b31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5cea91ca-d123-498e-a20c-dcf7b8d906ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d586054fa0f776634977e44114946828af30c4adc8d662ee503462b973d1e359"}, "2": {"node_id": "1492281f-c58a-4285-b6bb-29b0b1f49508", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "87b6e4e409dfd2a92354f4c75e7123126eae1e342dd9e52f7bb41104eb4084c9"}}, "hash": "3b99aaeb07df4286e0e9d7593782277901fc59b0e8f6039f0b53b080d48b0168", "text": "Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(i) and 423.44(d)(1), an MA or Part D plan that chooses to disenroll beneficiaries for failure to pay premiums must be able to demonstrate to CMS that it made a reasonable effort to collect the unpaid amounts by notifying the beneficiary of the delinquency, providing the beneficiary a period of no less than two months in which to resolve the delinquency, and advising the beneficiary of the termination of coverage if the amounts owed are not paid by the end of the grace period. Further, as outlined in \u00a7 423.44(e), CMS involuntarily disenrolls individuals from their Part D coverage for failure to pay Part D\u2013IRMAA following an initial grace period of 3 months. Current regulations at \u00a7 417.460(c) \nspecify that an HMO or competitive medical plan (cost plan) may disenroll a member who fails to pay premiums or other charges imposed by the plan for deductible and coinsurance amounts. While there is not a grace period parallel to the grace period required by the MA and Part D regulations, the requirements for cost plans are otherwise similar. The cost plan must demonstrate that it made reasonable efforts to collect the unpaid amount and send the enrollee written notice of the disenrollment prior to transmitting the disenrollment to CMS. \nThe final rule, titled \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for Contract Year 2012 and Other Changes\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2011 (76 FR 21431) amended both the Parts C and D regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(v), 423.44(d)(1), and 423.44(e)(3) regarding involuntary disenrollment for non- payment of premiums or Part D\u2013IRMAA to allow for reinstatement of the beneficiary\u2019s enrollment into the plan for good cause. The good cause provision established that CMS can reinstate enrollment of a disenrolled individual\u2019s coverage in certain circumstances where the non-payment of premiums was due to a circumstance that the individual could not reasonably foresee and could not control, such as an extended period of hospitalization. In the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for Contract Year 2013 and Other Changes\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on April 12, 2012 (77 FR 22071), we extended the policy of reinstatement for good cause to include beneficiaries enrolled in cost plans in \u00a7 417.460(c)(3), thus aligning the cost plan reinstatement provision with the MA and Part D plan provisions. In the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2016 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on February 12, 2015 (80 FR 7911), we amended \u00a7 417.460(c)(3), \u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(v), and \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(vi) to permit an entity acting on behalf of CMS, such as an MA organization, Part D sponsor, or entity offering a cost plan, to effectuate reinstatements for beneficiaries disenrolled for nonpayment of plan premium when good cause criteria are met. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00129 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6471444d-f1e3-49a2-83b5-aedbd78fdd45": {"__data__": {"id_": "6471444d-f1e3-49a2-83b5-aedbd78fdd45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b492b113-bd58-480b-ad52-fb05c512ba32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "123fbb5a00c5d794f8ad1432da4af4538a4ec09b983843731b4a3a76ee2b2557"}, "3": {"node_id": "b635fe4f-5df5-4523-b44f-ac996dd447b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8fd5a65f94c41841f20a28a194ec7cb1bc41ade8489e07929175997f2620dd46"}}, "hash": "48c0c5f14f19999f5e4eca745d175cdfebf1457c3bd079b30f008e483315aaa2", "text": "79580 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nTo provide transparency to \nstakeholders, we are proposing to codify \nour current policy for MA organizations, Part D sponsors, or entities offering cost plans, as set out in sub-regulatory guidance in section 60.3.4 of Chapter 2, Medicare Managed Care Manual, section 60.2.4 of Chapter 3, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual and section 60.6.3 of Chapter 17\u2013D, Medicare Managed Care Manual, that reinstatement for good cause, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 417.460(c)(3), 422.74(d)(1)(v), and 423.44(d)(1)(vi), will occur only when the individual requests reinstatement within 60 calendar days of the disenrollment effective date and that an individual may make only one reinstatement request for good cause in this 60-day period.

Section 1860D\u2013 1(b)(1)(B)(v) of the Act generally directs us to establish rules related to enrollment, disenrollment, and termination for Part D plan sponsors that are similar to those established for MA organizations under section 1851(g) of the Act. Section 1876 of the Act sets forth the rules for Medicare cost plan contracts with HMOs and competitive \nmedical plans (CMPs). In implementing regulations which appeared in the Federal Register on September 1, 1995 (60 FR 45678), we established at \u00a7 417.460(e) the basis for HMOs and CMPs to disenroll individuals for \ndisruptive, unruly, abusive, or uncooperative behavior. In implementing regulations which appeared in the Federal Register on June 26, 1998 (63 FR 35071), we established at \u00a7 422.74 the conditions for MA organizations (referred to M+C organizations at the time) to disenroll individuals for disruptive behavior. Additionally, the regulations established the requirement for a final notice to the beneficiary of the submission of the disenrollment, which applies to disruptive behavior disenrollments, at \u00a7 422.74(c). The optional basis for disenrollment for disruptive behavior was established at \u00a7 422.74(b)(1)(ii). The general standards defining disruptiveness were established in \u00a7 422.74(d)(2). \nIn January 2005, we published a final \nrule that revised the definition for disruptive behavior at \u00a7 422.74(d)(2) (70 FR 4718), with the purpose of creating an objective definition that did not use the previously subjective terms such as \u2018\u2018unruly\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018abrasive.\u2019\u2019 The current, objective definition from the January 2005 MA final rule both defines disruptive behavior and establishes the required process for an MA plan to request disenrollment of a disruptive individual. In January 2005 we also published the Part D implementing regulation (70 FR 4525), where we established the conditions for a PDP sponsor to disenroll an individual for disruptive behavior. We established the basis for optional disenrollment for disruptive behavior at \u00a7 423.44(b)(1)(ii). We also established the definition of disruptive behavior and disenrollment process as it exists currently at \u00a7 423.44(d)(2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b635fe4f-5df5-4523-b44f-ac996dd447b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b635fe4f-5df5-4523-b44f-ac996dd447b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b492b113-bd58-480b-ad52-fb05c512ba32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "123fbb5a00c5d794f8ad1432da4af4538a4ec09b983843731b4a3a76ee2b2557"}, "2": {"node_id": "6471444d-f1e3-49a2-83b5-aedbd78fdd45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "48c0c5f14f19999f5e4eca745d175cdfebf1457c3bd079b30f008e483315aaa2"}}, "hash": "8fd5a65f94c41841f20a28a194ec7cb1bc41ade8489e07929175997f2620dd46", "text": "In the January 2005 Part D final rule, we also established the requirement for a final notice of the submission of the disenrollment transaction, which applies to disruptive behavior disenrollments, at \u00a7 423.44(c). \nUnder CMS\u2019s current MA and Part D \nregulations, disruptive behavior is defined as behavior by the plan enrollee that substantially impairs the plan\u2019s ability to arrange for or provide services for the individual or other plan members (\u00a7\u00a7 417.460(e)(1); 422.74(d)(2)(i); 423.44(d)(2)(i)). The process for disenrolling an enrollee for disruptive behavior requires approval by CMS before the disenrollment may be submitted (\u00a7\u00a7 417.460(e)(5); 422.74(d)(2)(v); 423.44(d)(2)(v)). MA organizations, Part D sponsors, and cost plans must make serious efforts to resolve the problem considering any extenuating circumstances; for MA \norganizations, cost plans, and Part D sponsors this includes providing reasonable accommodations for those beneficiaries with mental or cognitive conditions (\u00a7\u00a7 417.460(e)(2) and (3); 422.74(d)(2)(iii); 423.44(d)(2)(iii)). MA organizations, Part D sponsors, and cost plans must also document the beneficiary\u2019s behavior and the plan\u2019s own efforts to resolve the issue, and this record must be submitted to CMS before disenrollment can be approved (\u00a7\u00a7 417.460(e)(4) and (5); 422.74(d)(2)(iv) and (v); 423.44(d)(2)(iv) and (v)). The current definition of disruptive behavior in \u00a7\u00a7 417.460(e)(1), 422.74(d)(2), and 423.44(d)(2) served as the basis for CMS\u2019s current sub- regulatory guidance found in Chapter 2, section 50.3.2, of the Medicare Managed Care Manual and Chapter 3, section 50.3.2, of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual and Chapter 17D, section 50.3.3, of the Medicare Managed Care Manual. In guidance, we outline member notices that an MA organization, Part D sponsor, and cost plans must send before requesting permission from CMS to involuntarily disenroll the member. \nTo provide transparency to \nstakeholders and stability as to the operation of the program, we are proposing to codify current policy for MA, Part D, and cost plan notices during the disenrollment for disruptive behavior process. These notices provide the beneficiary with a warning of the potential consequences of continued disruptive behavior. In a new proposed paragraph, a \u00a7 422.74(d)(2)(vii), we propose to codify existing policy currently set out in sub-regulatory guidance regarding MA plan notices prior to a member disenrollment for disruptive behavior. To request approval of a disenrollment for disruptive behavior, an MA organization would be required to provide two notices: (1) an advance notice, informing the plan member that continued disruptive behavior could lead to involuntary disenrollment; and (2) a notice of the plan\u2019s intent to request CMS permission to disenroll the member, sent at least 30 days after the advance notice to give the member an opportunity to cease the behavior. These notices are in addition to the disenrollment submission notice currently required under \u00a7 422.74(c). We are also proposing to revise the existing requirement at \u00a7 422.74(d)(2)(iii) that plans inform the individual of the right to use the plan\u2019s grievance procedures, to clarify that this information should be conveyed as part of the notices described in new paragraph (d)(2)(vii).

To request approval of a disenrollment for disruptive behavior, a PDP sponsor would be required to provide two notices: (1) an advance notice, informing the plan member that continued disruptive behavior could lead to involuntary disenrollment; (2) a notice of intent to request CMS permission to disenroll the member, sent at least 30 days after the advance notice to give the member an opportunity to cease the behavior. These notices are in addition to the disenrollment submission notice currently required under \u00a7 423.44(c). We are also proposing to revise the existing requirement at \u00a7 423.44(d)(2)(iii) that plans inform the individual of the right to use the plan\u2019s grievance procedures, to clarify that this information should be conveyed as part of the notices described in new paragraph (2)(d)(viii). Additionally, as proposed in additions to \u00a7 423.44(d)(2)(iv), the plan would be required to submit dated copies of these required notices to CMS along with the other documentation regarding enrollee behavior and the plan\u2019s efforts to resolve the issues. \nAt \u00a7 417.460(e)(7) we propose to \ncodify existing policy guidance currently set out in subregulatory guidance regarding cost plan notices prior to an enrollee disenrollment for cause (disruptive behavior). Current guidance is found in Chapter 17D of the Medicare Managed Care Manual, section 50.3.3. To request approval of a disenrollment for disruptive behavior, an HMO or CMP would be required to provide two notices: (1) an advance notice, informing the enrollee that continued disruptive behavior could lead to involuntary disenrollment; (2) a notice of intent to request CMS permission to disenroll the enrollee, sent at least 30 days after the advance notice to give the member an opportunity to cease the behavior. These notices are in addition to the disenrollment submission notice currently required under \u00a7 417.460(e)(6). We are also proposing to revise the existing requirement at \u00a7 417.460(e)(2) that plans inform the individual of the right to use the plan\u2019s grievance \nprocedures, to clarify that this information should be conveyed as part of the notices described in new \nparagraph (e)(7). Additionally we are proposing in \u00a7 417.460(e)(2) that, as part of its efforts to resolve the problem presented by the enrollee, a HMO or CMP must provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with mental or cognitive conditions, including mental illness and developmental disabilities, similar to the existing requirement in the MA and Part D regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(d)(2)(iii); 423.44(d)(2)(iii)). As proposed in \u00a7 417.460(e)(4), cost plans would be required to submit dated copies of these required notices to CMS along with other documentation regarding enrollee behavior and the plan\u2019s efforts to resolve the issues. \nWe are codifying longstanding \nguidance with these changes. All information impacts related to the involuntary disenrollment by the plan for disruptive behavior have already been accounted for under OMB control numbers 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267) for Part C and 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u201310141) for Part D. Based on infrequent questions from MA organizations, Part D, and cost plan sponsors on these notices, as these notice requirements have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by plans, we conclude that these updates do not add to the existing disenrollment process and we do not believe there is any additional paperwork burden. \nM. Codification of the Part D Optional \nDisenrollment for Fraud and Abuse Policy (\u00a7 423.44) \nAs noted previously, section \n1851(g)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that an MA organization may disenroll individuals that engage in disruptive behavior.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76fec1ff-0e0e-4e23-ac75-73807e7c55ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "76fec1ff-0e0e-4e23-ac75-73807e7c55ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94505571-7f61-4674-ac17-37c0edbaac52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "99a16b50444946a18459870ffb397ce63183a5d0e2755cdaf886076a58321400"}, "2": {"node_id": "27661f29-e8cc-4cc4-ac89-343bb292f323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "588d21e774dd8d89ac33710f3525ec4e71714509a92dff9842e59a7a26d1ce1f"}}, "hash": "acfcec319bb4b5ca7e8434a8e83491cfefe3fe6b3c0dff7f44e28de230438e0f", "text": "In 1998, the Part C implementing regulations at 63 FR 35075 separately referred to a different kind of \u2018\u2018disruption\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018failure to cooperate\u2019\u2019, namely, fraud or abuse on the part of the individual on the enrollment form, or by misuse of the individual\u2019s enrollment card. This basis for termination, that is, if the individual provides fraudulent information on his or her election form or permits abuse of his or her enrollment card, which was \nalso based on section 1851(g)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, was codified as a separate paragraph at \u00a7 422.74(b)(1)(iii) (63 FR 35075). Regulations also provided a process for disenrollment on this basis, whereby, an M+C organization may disenroll an individual that knowingly provides, on the election form, fraudulent information that materially affects the individual\u2019s eligibility to enroll in the M+C plan, or intentionally permits others to use his or her enrollment card to obtain services under \nthe M+C plan, as long as a notice of disenrollment is provided as outlined in Federal law. The M+C organization was also required to report the disenrollment to Medicare. This process for disenrollment based on fraud or abuse on the part of the individual was codified at \u00a7 422.74(d)(3) (63 FR 35075). Fraud and abuse by the enrollee are treated in the same manner as other forms of disruptive behavior, with the individual being disenrolled into the original Medicare program. \nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108\u2013173) enacted the Medicare Advantage program, which replaced the M+C program established under title XVIII of the Act, and amended title XVIII of the Act to add a new part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). Section 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(v) of the Act specifies that in establishing a process for Part D enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change of enrollment of Part D eligible individuals in prescription drug plans, the Secretary shall use rules similar to (and coordinated with) the rules for an MA\u2013 PD plan established under section 1851(g) of the Act. In 2005, CMS finalized implementing regulations, at \u00a7\u00a7 423.44 (b)(1)(ii) and (d)(2), providing that PDP sponsors may disenroll an individual who engages in disruptive behavior and defining the process for disenrollment on this basis (70 FR 4530). However, CMS\u2019s 2005 implementing regulations did not include provisions allowing PDP sponsors the ability to disenroll individuals on the basis of fraud or abuse on the part of the individual on the enrollment form, or by misuse of the individual\u2019s enrollment card, equivalent to the MA regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(b)(1)(iii) and (d)(3). \nAlthough CMS has adopted and \nimplemented this same basis for optional disenrollment from a Part D plan in sub-regulatory guidance, we are now proposing to codify the policy for optional disenrollment from a Part D plan based on an individual providing fraudulent information on his or her election form or permitting abuse of his or her enrollment card. Our intent is to codify the current policy, as reflected in section 50.3.3 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. These proposed regulations would also align the rules for Part D plans with the current rules for MA plans for optional disenrollment for an individual who commits fraud or \npermits abuse of their enrollment card, as provided in the MA regulations at \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81762014-7709-45bc-8ef7-20e71efc98f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "81762014-7709-45bc-8ef7-20e71efc98f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8cf5b5b-3cde-44c6-b66f-fe35ff76cd06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "aae35f59dfdd96b96f17d132b6dd493396abc600a0b7b10c4286f0f9e870dc63"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6df823b-c114-4dca-a649-5f92daa8119e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "be1b887cc79fa1ac5cee293066c889a2d67fcc553ca969af5afb7384fa05c4b1"}}, "hash": "a3af35cb50305e932f4c8616d70683e9ec2e2607857b7653cb0e195441385c2f", "text": "79582 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n\u00a7 422.74.

Further, we are proposing to add a new \u00a7 423.44(d)(9) to establish the process for optional disenrollment for an individual who commits fraud or permits abuse of their enrollment card. We are proposing to add a new \u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(i) to establish a basis for disenrollment for an individual who commits fraud or permits abuse of their enrollment card as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(i)(A) and 423.44(d)(9)(i)(B). We are proposing to establish in \u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(i)(A) that a Part D plan may disenroll an individual who knowingly provides, on the election form, fraudulent information that materially affects the individual\u2019s eligibility to enroll in the Part D plan. We are proposing to establish in \u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(i)(B) that a Part D plan may disenroll an individual who intentionally permits others to use his or her enrollment card to obtain drugs under the Part D plan. \nWe are further proposing to add a new \n\u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(ii) to establish that a Part D plan who opts to disenroll an individual who commits fraud or permits abuse of their enrollment card must provide the individual a written notice of the disenrollment that meets the notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 423.44(c) of this section. We are also proposing to add a new \u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(iii) to establish that a Part D plan must report to CMS any disenrollment based on fraud or abuse by the individual. \nWith regard to our Part D optional \ninvoluntary disenrollment for fraud and abuse policy, the following change will be submitted to OMB for review under control number OMB 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u2013 10141). We estimate that it will take a Part D plan three hours to capture and retain the required documentation for each occurrence of disenrollment for fraud and abuse. In part, the burden \nassociated with this requirement is the time and effort necessary for a Part D plan to document and retain the documentation that meets the requirements set forth in this section. Based on actual experience, since 2012, there have only been five disenrollments for fraud and abuse. Three of those disenrollments were from MA/MAPD plans, one was from the \nLimited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LI NET) plan, and one was from a standalone Part D plan. Thus, the burden to Part D plans is negligible and per 5 CFR 1320.3(c) not subject to PRA because it involves less than 10 entities per year. Nonetheless, we will still add this information to the information collection currently approved under OMB control number 0938\u20130964. In addition, based on this data, we do not expect any future impact to the Medicare Trust Fund. \nWe are further proposing in \n\u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(ii) that the Part D plan must provide a written notice of disenrollment to the member to advise them of the plan\u2019s intent to disenroll, as required under \u00a7 423.44(c) of this subpart. Lastly, we are proposing in \u00a7 423.44(d)(9)(iii) that the Part D plan must report to CMS any disenrollment based on fraud or abuse by the member. All information impacts related to providing a written notice to the member and notifying CMS of the disenrollment have already been accounted for under OMB control numbers 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u201310141). \nN.

In Part D implementing regulations (70 FR 4525), we established the basis for an optional involuntary disenrollment for \nfailure to pay premiums as well as the disenrollment process. The basis for disenrollment for failure to pay premiums was established at \u00a7 423.44(b)(1)(i). The disenrollment process for failure to pay premiums was established at \u00a7 423.44(d)(1). In 2009, we added an exception to this disenrollment provision which prohibited plans from disenrolling individuals who are in premium withhold status (74 FR 1543). The premium withhold status exception was established at \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(iv) and later renumbered to paragraph (v) in 2010 when we added the grace period requirement at \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(iii) (75 FR 19816). \nSection 1860D\u201323 of the Act directed \nthe Secretary to establish coordination rules between State Pharmaceutical \nAssistance Programs (SPAPs) and Part D plan sponsors regarding the payment of premiums for Part D eligible individuals. SPAPs, and other third- party payer assistance programs, have the option to cover Part D premiums for individuals. Implementing regulation (70 FR 4525) established the requirement that Part D plan sponsors must permit SPAPs, and other entities, to coordinate benefits with the plan, including paying for premiums, at \u00a7 423.464(a). \nTo protect beneficiaries who have \nSPAPs, or other payers, cover their premiums, we propose to codify current policy that excepts certain prescription drug plan (PDP) members from being disenrolled for failure to pay plan premiums, at \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(v). This policy is currently set out in sub- regulatory guidance, specifically section 50.3.1 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, that Part D plan sponsors have previously implemented and are currently following. We propose, at revised \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(v), a disenrollment exception if the sponsor has been notified that an SPAP, or other payer, is paying the Part D portion of the premium, and the sponsor has not yet coordinated receipt of the premium payments with the SPAP or other payer. Sponsors would not be able to initiate the disenrollment process or disenroll members who qualify for this exception. \nIn addition, we are taking this \nopportunity to propose a technical \ncorrection to revise an erroneous cross reference in \u00a7 423.44(d)(1). Instead of referring to paragraph (d)(1)(iv), the language should refer to paragraph (d)(1)(v). \nWe are codifying longstanding \nguidance with these changes. All information impacts related to the involuntary disenrollment by the plan for failure to pay Part D plan premiums have already been accounted for under OMB control 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u201310141). Based on infrequent questions or complaints from Part D sponsors on these notices, we believe that these disenrollment requirements have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by sponsors. These updates do not add to the existing disenrollment process, so we do not believe there is any additional paperwork burden. \nO.

Section 1860D\u20131(b)(3)(C) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to establish SEPs for exceptional circumstances for Medicare-eligible individuals to make Part D elections. \nThe SEPs for exceptional \ncircumstances were historically included in our sub-regulatory guidance rather than in regulation. In 2020, we codified and amended a number of SEPs that had been adopted and implemented through sub-regulatory guidance as exceptional circumstances SEPs, including the SEP for Government Entity-Declared Disaster or Other Emergency (85 FR 33901, 33909). This SEP, as codified at \u00a7 422.62(b)(18) for enrollment in an MA or MA\u2013PD plan and \u00a7 423.38(c)(23) for enrollment in a Part D-only plan, allows individuals who are or have been affected by an emergency or major disaster declared by a Federal, State, or local government entity, and did not make an election during another period of eligibility as a result of the disaster/emergency, to make an MA and/or Part D enrollment or disenrollment action. Although CMS originally proposed that this SEP would only apply to FEMA-declared disasters or emergencies, as finalized in 2020, the regulations also include State and local emergency or major disaster declarations (85 FR 33868). This SEP begins the date the disaster/emergency declaration is made, the incident start date or, if different, the start date identified in the declaration, whichever is earlier. This SEP ends 2 full calendar months following the end date identified in the declaration or, if different, the date the end of the incident is announced, whichever is later. \nIn order to clarify the length of this \nSEP, we are proposing to revise the end date(s) for the SEP for Government Entity-Declared Disaster or Other Emergency. We are proposing two changes in \u00a7\u00a7 422.62(b)(18) and 423.38(c)(23) regarding this SEP. \nFirst, we are proposing that for State \nor local emergencies/disasters, the end date for the SEP may also be based on an emergency/disaster order automatically expiring pursuant to a \nState or local law, if such a law exists. Applicable State or local law could be statutes, regulations, local or municipal ordinance or code regarding the automatic expiration date of State or local emergency orders. If the announced incident period end date is different than the expiration date specified in State or local law, the announced incident end date controls \nthe SEP end date. Under this proposal, the SEP ends based on the end of the emergency/disaster period, regardless of whether that period ends based on an announcement by the applicable authority or expires based on applicable State or local law. \nSecond, we are proposing an \nautomatic incident end date which will apply if no end date for the period of disaster/emergency is otherwise identified within 1 year of the start of the SEP. This automatic incident end date will fall 1 year after the SEP start date, meaning that if no end date is otherwise identified, the SEP will be 14 full calendar months in length. For example, under our proposed changes, if no incident end date was identified in the declaration, or announced later, and there is no applicable expiration date provided by State or local law, CMS would consider the incident end date to be 1 year after the SEP start date and the SEP would end 2 full calendar months after that incident end date, which would result in a 14-month maximum SEP. We are seeking public comment on this automatic 1-year incident end date to determine if the 14-month maximum eligibility period for this SEP is sufficient. We propose that if the emergency/disaster declaration is extended, then the automatic 1-year incident end date would be from the date of the extension. This would address situations where a declaration of emergency or major disaster is renewed or extended (perhaps multiple times) so that the state of emergency or major disaster lasts for a year or more. These proposed changes will provide clear end dates for this SEP and should allow stakeholders to more easily calculate SEP length and determine beneficiary eligibility for the SEP. \nBecause an individual may elect a \nMedicare Advantage or Part D plan only during an election period, Medicare Advantage organizations and Part D sponsors already have procedures in place to determine the election period(s) for which an applicant is eligible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c49de67-ac75-45f5-867f-5a6bf81fa37c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c49de67-ac75-45f5-867f-5a6bf81fa37c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "447bd483-9a68-4494-b008-06bda4da7f3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37506e385cfdc3a922ce1e1b5e30bd7586a891f141f00bde2f34d614d2856425"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad760260-62f0-4817-8f55-bac9f47fbbe3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "af88e6415349e604956bb55bf6e87ffa3dede38b1f977d00b1abad99e09e9fe0"}}, "hash": "4bf21acfe185ffe28b0b9e0f50eeea317571f077fa7a5022de89c7adfd6e8bf7", "text": "Our proposal would not add to existing enrollment processes, so we believe any burden associated with this aspect of enrollment processing would remain unchanged from the current practice, and would not impose any new requirements or burden.

In addition, Medicare Advantage organizations and \nPart D sponsors have previously implemented and are currently following the process to determine applicant eligibility for this SEP. We believe that changing the possible end date for this SEP will make a negligible impact, if any. We do not believe the proposed changes will adversely impact individuals requesting enrollment in Medicare plans, the plans themselves, or their current enrollees. Similarly, we do not believe the proposed changes would have any impact to the Medicare Trust Funds. \nP.

In the June 1998 IFC, we adopted regulations to address the residency and continuation area requirements, at \u00a7\u00a7 422.50(a)(3) and 422.54, respectively, as well as a regulation, at \u00a7 422.74(b)(2)(i), requiring that an MA organization must disenroll an individual who no longer resides in the plan service area. \nSection 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act \ngenerally directs CMS to use rules related to enrollment, disenrollment, and termination for Part D sponsors that are similar to those established for MA organizations under section 1851(b)(1)(A) of the Act.

In the June 1998 interim final rule with comment period (63 FR 35073), we established at \u00a7 422.62(b)(2) an SEP for an individual who is not eligible to remain enrolled in an MA plan because of a change in his or her place of residence to a location out of the service area or continuation area. Likewise, in the January 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR 4194), we established at \u00a7 423.38(c)(7) an SEP for an individual who is no longer eligible for the PDP because of a change in his or her place of residence to a location outside of the PDP region(s) where the PDP is offered are eligible for an SEP. \nCurrent sub-regulatory guidance for \nthese SEPs that are codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.62(b)(2) and 423.38(c)(7), as reflected in section 30.4.1 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for MA and in section 30.3.1 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, provide that these SEPs are available not only to individuals who become ineligible for their current plan due to a move out of the service area of their current plan, but also to those who move within the service area of their current plan and have new plan options available to them, as well as to those who are not currently enrolled in a Medicare health or drug plan who move and have new plan options available to them. We propose to address the wider scope of these SEPs, as they are currently set out in sub- regulatory guidance, by amending \u00a7\u00a7 422.62(b)(2) and 423.38(c)(7) to include individuals who move within the service area of their current plan and \nhave new Medicare health or drug plan options available to them, as well as to those who are not currently enrolled in a Medicare health or drug plan who move and have new plan options available to them. \nThe intent of our proposal is to codify \ncurrent policy as reflected in CMS\u2019s existing subregulatory guidance and that is being carried out currently by MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors. Codifying our current policy for these SEPs will provide transparency and stability for stakeholders about the MA and Part D programs and about the nature and scope of these SEPs. \nSeparate from, but related to, the \naforementioned policy for disenrolling individuals who report that they no \nlonger reside in the plan service area are the current regulations at \u00a7 422.74(d)(4)(ii) that require that MA organizations disenroll individuals who are absent from the service area for more than six months. However, \u00a7 422.74(d)(4)(iii) provides an exception for individuals enrolled in MA plans that offer a visitor/traveler benefit are permitted an absence from the service area for up to 12 months; such individuals are disenrolled if their absence from the service area exceeds 12 months (or the length of the visitor/ traveler program if less than 12 months). As outlined at \u00a7 423.44(d)(5)(ii), PDP sponsors must disenroll PDP enrollees who are absent from the plan service area for more than 12 months. \nIn the event that member materials are \nreturned to plan sponsors as undeliverable and a forwarding address is not specified, current sub-regulatory guidance directs the plan sponsor to document the return, retain the returned material and continue to send future correspondence to that same address, as a forwarding address may become available at a later date.

Plan sponsors that are unable to contact the member or obtain current address information will disenroll the member upon expiration of the 6- or 12-month period of permitted temporary absence from the plan service area, as previously discussed. \nCurrent MA guidance in \u00a7 50.2.1.4 of \nChapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual regarding research of potential changes in address is consistent with the MA regulation at \u00a7 422.74(d)(4)(i) providing that \u2018\u2018the MA organization must disenroll an individual if the MA organization establishes, on the basis of a written statement from the individual or other evidence acceptable to CMS, that the individual has permanently \nmoved.\u2019\u2019 The analogous Part D regulation at \u00a7 423.44(d)(5)(i) requires that the \u2018\u2018PDP must disenroll an individual if the individual notifies the PDP that he or she has permanently moved out of the PDP service area,\u2019\u2019 but the Part D regulation does not provide a basis similar to the MA regulation for when PDPs may start the process of researching and acting on a change of address that the plan learns about from a source other than the member.

Therefore, we propose to align the Part D regulation with MA regulation by amending \u00a7 423.44(d)(5)(i) to state that a PDP must disenroll an individual if the PDP establishes, on the basis of a written statement from the individual or other evidence acceptable to CMS, that the individual has permanently moved out of the PDP service area. \nCurrent sub-regulatory guidance does \nnot identify returned mail as a basis for involuntary disenrollment.

Because an individual may elect an MA or Part D plan only during an election period and may continue enrollment in an MA or Part D plan only if the individual resides in the plan service area, or for some MA plans, the plan continuation area, MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors already have procedures in place to determine the election period(s) for which an applicant is eligible and to determine the point at which an enrollee is no longer eligible for the plan and must be disenrolled. Our proposal would not add to existing enrollment and disenrollment processes, so we believe any burden associated with these aspects of enrollment and disenrollment processing would remain unchanged from the current practices, and would not impose any new requirements or burden. All information impacts related to the determination of eligibility for an election period and to the disenrollment of individuals who become ineligible for an MA or Part D plan based on the residency requirements have already been accounted for under OMB control numbers 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267) for Part C and 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u201310141) for Part D. Q. Codify the Term \u2018\u2018Whole Calendar \nMonths\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7\u00a7 422.74 and 423.44) \nSection 1851(g)(3)(B)(i) of the Act \nprovides that an MA organization may involuntarily terminate an individual\u2019s election in a MA plan if monthly basic and supplemental beneficiary premiums are not paid timely, and provides for a grace period for payment of such premiums. Consistent with this section of the Act, the Part C regulations set forth our requirements with respect to optional involuntary disenrollment procedures under \u00a7 422.74. \nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108\u2013173) enacted the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which replaced the M+C program established under title XVIII of the Act, and amended title XVIII of the Act to add a new Part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). Section 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(v) of the Act specifies that in establishing a process for Part D enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change of enrollment of Part D eligible individuals in prescription drug plans, the Secretary shall use rules similar to (and coordinated with) the rules for an MA plan established under section 1851(g) (other than paragraph (2) of such section and clause (i) and the second sentence of clause (ii) of paragraph (3)(C) of such section) of the Act. Consistent with these sections of the Act, the Part D regulations set forth our requirements with respect to optional involuntary disenrollment procedures under \u00a7 423.44. \nIn 2010, CMS amended the Part C and \nPart D regulations regarding optional involuntary disenrollment for nonpayment of premiums to require a minimum grace period of 2 months before any disenrollment occurs. This timeframe was established to provide adequate time for organizations to respond to instances in which individuals fail to pay their premiums, and for affected enrollees to take steps to remedy the situation and avoid disenrollment. These requirements were codified at \u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(i)(B)(1) (75 FR 19804) and \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(iii)(A) (75 FR 19816).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8815788f-be4e-42a9-9dfd-27e9365bdad4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8815788f-be4e-42a9-9dfd-27e9365bdad4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1d60fdc-ff73-4621-8993-e6cac3ba4471", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ae6b74e50ecf9f92a6fd72d2a9dfea75165f532196f12f72df11cee7c6c3040b"}, "2": {"node_id": "921ed5df-644d-4d73-9bbd-17e200daaf1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6e9a2ef4ac2b6ced35d7cd9ded6167c812105bf6846edc0b15ab8360c10c713d"}}, "hash": "6a551022743628ddba512556f3845bd31dbdc7f3637527574a536c3cd72d174e", "text": "CMS also revised these regulations to include the requirement that the grace period begin on the first day of the month for which the premium is unpaid or the first day of the month following the date on which premium payment is requested, whichever is later.

In subsequent subregulatory guidance \nin section 50.3.1, Chapter 2 of the \nMedicare Managed Care Manual and section 50.3.1, Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual we defined the grace period for nonpayment of plan premium as a whole number of calendar months, not \nfractions of months. As the term \u2018\u2018whole calendar months\u2019\u2019 is not specifically mentioned in the Part C and Part D regulations, we are proposing to revise \u00a7\u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(i)(B)(1) and 423.44(d)(1)(iii)(A) to include the requirement that the grace period be at least 2 whole calendar months, to begin on the first day of the month for which the premium is unpaid or the first day of the month following the date on which premium payment is requested, whichever is later. To illustrate this proposal, we provide the following example. \nAn MA or Part D plan has a 2-month \ngrace period for premium payment. The grace period cannot begin until the individual has been notified of (billed for) the actual premium amount due, with such notice/bill specifying the due date for that amount and providing an opportunity to pay. On January 10th, a member is billed for his or her premium which is due on February 1. The member does not pay this premium and on February 7th, the sponsor sends the notice required by \u00a7 422.74(d)(1)(ii) or \u00a7 423.44(d)(1)(ii). The member does not act in response to this notice or any subsequent premium bills and payments are not made for February or March. The grace period is the months of February and March. If the member does not pay the unpaid plan premiums before the end of March, the individual would be disenrolled as of April 1. \nCodifying this policy that a plan must \nprovide a grace period of at least 2 whole calendar months will provide transparency and stability for stakeholders, and align with longstanding sub-regulatory guidance described in section 50.3.1, Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual and section 50.3.1, Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual regarding timeframes for disenrollment, which establish that the grace period must be a whole number of calendar months and cannot include \nfractions of months. \nPlan sponsors that have chosen to \ndisenroll individuals based on unpaid premiums already have procedures in place to implement a grace period that is a minimum of 2 months in length. Based on infrequent complaints or questions from sponsors, we believe that plan sponsors are complying with this guidance, and we are not proposing any \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9650a3f2-efe7-490f-a73b-c35eb499108e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9650a3f2-efe7-490f-a73b-c35eb499108e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4fa875f8-d570-44da-958a-910be1a5a547", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e0ae660a7abcaffb3dd77b4dd1c16641020f4bc094aaf10da8d4febba48adcb9"}, "3": {"node_id": "00d35b79-ff45-490a-b7a6-f5e03f301496", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d71fc617aacd720068e6daa152f92bbffdbfd0086f6ac8b1019d48760ba31aba"}}, "hash": "4b14a839e0f7bf4860bae79827261d8d3760a888245d5683fd028f1374790a1d", "text": "79586 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nchanges to the requirements or process \nfor involuntary disenrollment that plan sponsors have previously implemented and are currently following.

There is also no impact to the Medicare Trust Fund. \nR. Researching and Acting on a Change \nof Address (\u00a7\u00a7 422.74 and 423.44) \nAs discussed in our proposal for \nDeveloping Addresses for Members Whose Mail is Returned as Undeliverable and SEP for Changes in Residence (\u00a7\u00a7 422.62, 422.74, 423.38, 423.44), section 1851(b)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an individual is eligible to elect an MA plan only if the plan serves the geographic area in which the individual resides, and section 1860D\u2013 1(b)(1)(B) of the Act generally directs CMS to use rules related to enrollment, disenrollment, and termination for Part D sponsors that are similar to those established for MA organizations under section 1851(b)(1)(A) of the Act. \nPursuant to regulations at \u00a7 422.74(c) \nfor MA and \u00a7 423.44(c) for Part D, MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors are currently required to issue a disenrollment notice when an enrollee is disenrolled for not residing in the plan service area. Existing sub- regulatory guidance includes a requirement that MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors issue the disenrollment notice within 10 days of the plan learning of the permanent move. See \u00a7 50.2.1.5 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for MA and \u00a7 50.2.1.6 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, respectively. In the case of MA plan enrollees who are disenrolled because they are absent from the service area for more than six months, the disenrollment notice must be provided within the first ten calendar days of the sixth month. Individuals enrolled in MA plans that offer a visitor/traveler benefit are permitted an absence from the service area for up to 12 months; such individuals are disenrolled if their absence from the service area exceeds \n12 months (or the length of the visitor/ traveler program if less than 12 months). In this scenario, the MA organization must provide notification of the upcoming disenrollment to the enrollee during the first ten calendar days of the 12th month (or the last month of the allowable absence, per the visitor/ traveler program). PDP enrollees are disenrolled if they are absent from the plan service area for more than 12 months. For these cases, the disenrollment notice must be provided \nwithin the first 10 calendar days of the 12th month. For instances in which a plan learns of an individual\u2019s absence from the service area after the expiration of the period of time allowed under the applicable regulation, the plan would provide the disenrollment notice within 10 calendar days of learning of the absence. \nAlthough we have previously codified \nthe requirement to issue a disenrollment notice when an individual is disenrolled due to an extended absence from the plan service area, or a change in residence to a location outside the service area, the 10-day timeframe for issuing that notice is reflected only in sub-regulatory guidance. We propose to amend the MA and Part D plan disenrollment notification requirements to include the 10-day timeframe that is currently reflected in sub-regulatory guidance. Specifically, we are proposing to codify at \u00a7 422.74(d)(4)(iv) and at \u00a7 423.44(d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(ii) a timeliness requirement of 10 calendar days for issuing notices for disenrollment\u2019s based on the residency requirements. Separate from the disenrollment notification requirements described in the preceding paragraphs is a documentation retention requirement currently reflected in \u00a7 50.2.1.3 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for MA and in \u00a7 50.2.1.3 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00d35b79-ff45-490a-b7a6-f5e03f301496": {"__data__": {"id_": "00d35b79-ff45-490a-b7a6-f5e03f301496", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4fa875f8-d570-44da-958a-910be1a5a547", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e0ae660a7abcaffb3dd77b4dd1c16641020f4bc094aaf10da8d4febba48adcb9"}, "2": {"node_id": "9650a3f2-efe7-490f-a73b-c35eb499108e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4b14a839e0f7bf4860bae79827261d8d3760a888245d5683fd028f1374790a1d"}}, "hash": "d71fc617aacd720068e6daa152f92bbffdbfd0086f6ac8b1019d48760ba31aba", "text": "It has been CMS policy that MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors document their efforts to determine whether an enrollee has relocated out of the plan service area or has been absent from the service for a period of time in excess of what is allowed; however, our expectation that plans document their research efforts, although outlined in sub-regulatory guidance, is not codified. As such, we propose to amend the MA and Part D regulations to include the requirement that plans document their efforts to determine an enrollee\u2019s residency status. \nWe are proposing to codify at \n\u00a7 422.74(d)(4)(i) and at \u00a7 423.44(d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(ii) that MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors must document the basis for involuntary disenrollment actions that are based on the residency \nrequirements. \nThe intent of our proposal is to codify \ncurrent disenrollment notice policy, as reflected in \u00a7 50.2.1.5 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for MA and in \u00a7 50.2.1.6 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, and also codify the current documentation policy that is currently reflected in \u00a7 50.2.1.3 of Chapter 2 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for MA \nand in \u00a7 50.2.1.3 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, all of which are policies that are being carried out currently by MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors.

These requirements were \ncodified in the Part C regulations but were not codified in the Part D regulations. \nWe are proposing to codify this \nexisting policy to provide transparency and ensure consistency between the Part C and Part D programs. Specifically, we are proposing at new \u00a7\u00a7 423.32(i) and 423.36(e) to permit a Part D plan sponsor that has a contract with an employer or union group to arrange for the employer or union to process enrollment and disenrollment elections for Medicare-entitled group members who wish to enroll in or disenroll from an employer or union sponsored Part D plan. As outlined in sections 60.5.1 and 60.5.2 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, retroactive enrollments and disenrollments are permitted for up to 90 days to conform to the payment adjustments described under \u00a7\u00a7 422.308(f)(2) and 423.343(a). In addition, to obtain the retroactive effective date of the election, the individual must certify receipt of the group enrollment notice materials that include the summary of benefits offered under the PDP, as provided in sections 40.1.6 and 60.5 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. Once the enrollment or disenrollment election is received from the employer, the Part D plan sponsor must submit the disenrollment to CMS within the specified timeframes described in section 60.5 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. \nOur intent is to align the Part D \nregulation with the requirements that MA organizations follow in existing Part C regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.60(f) and 422.66(f) and codify existing policies in the sub-regulatory guidance in Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. Under section 60.5 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, retroactive transactions may be necessary and are permitted if a delay exists between the time the individual completes the enrollment or disenrollment request through the employer\u2019s election process and when the request is received by the Part D plan sponsor. Further, we state in current sub-regulatory guidance at section 60.5.1 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual that the option to submit limited EGHP retroactive enrollment and disenrollment transactions is to be used only for the purpose of submitting a retroactive enrollment into an EGHP made necessary due to the employer\u2019s delay in forwarding the completed enrollment request to the Part D plan \nsponsor. \nThis proposal is a codification of \nexisting Part D sub-regulatory guidance and there is no impact to the Medicare Trust Fund. Based on infrequent complaints and questions from plans and beneficiaries related to current policies, which have been previously implemented and are currently being followed by plans, we conclude that there is no additional paperwork burden. All information impacts related to this provision have already been accounted for under OMB control numbers 0938\u20131378 (CMS\u201310718) for Part D enrollment requests and 0938\u2013 0964 (CMS\u201310141) for Part D disenrollment requests. \nT.

In addition, we propose to codify our longstanding subregulatory policy that all communications and marketing materials (as these terms are defined at \u00a7 423.2260) for a plan offering Defined Standard coverage must reflect a single- tier benefit structure. \nUnder sections 1854(a)(1)(A) and \n1860D\u201311(b) of the Act, initial bid submissions for all MA plans, MA\u2013PD plans, and PDPs must be in a form and manner specified by the Secretary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee39fb86-701f-40d6-a13f-e22ae21c8fea": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee39fb86-701f-40d6-a13f-e22ae21c8fea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ff73389-2b1d-4d05-bd3d-1094e550925a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f9df56ea034750950929462849c819b87b32c01274ffc6dde7c49a35409038d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b05e5d3-20ab-4893-8728-2fb343146381", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "461ead92039cb81b47f0b7b8b3999b800d5d6141fd65872889ca7e575c5372d4"}}, "hash": "dff28de28c58711fb629ae0fb50ed67fb706850f3f9586eb8654a71cc9a2deec", "text": "To facilitate Part D sponsors\u2019 submission of their bids, we provided guidance \nregarding Incomplete and Inaccurate Bid Submissions on page 163 of the Final CY 2020 Part D Call Letter (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018\u2018Final CY 2020 Part D Call Letter,\u2019\u2019 and available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/ \nHealth-Plans/ MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Announcement2020.pdf) that a formulary crosswalk is one of the constituent components of a complete bid submission for a Part D sponsor that is offering a Part D plan with a formulary. Additionally, in the February 3, 2022 HPMS memo titled, \u2018\u2018Contract Year (CY) 2023 Final Part D Bidding Instructions\u2019\u2019 (available at https://www.cms.gov/files/document/ 2023partdbiddinginstructions.pdf), we referenced the Final CY 2020 Part D Call \nLetter policy on Incomplete and Inaccurate Bid Submissions as applicable for CY 2023. Further, the Bid Submission User Manual for Contract Year 2023, Chapter 10, Bid Submission Pre-Upload Requirements and Uploads (hereinafter referred to as \u2018\u2018Chapter 10\u2019\u2019 and available in the HPMS via the following path: Plan Bids/Bid Submission/CY 2023/View Documentation/Bid Submission User Manual/Chapter 10), provides detailed information about the formulary crosswalk. \nChapter 10 instructs all contracts that \nsubmitted a formulary through HPMS to submit a formulary crosswalk. Additionally, in order for the Formulary Crosswalk to be considered complete, Part D sponsors are also instructed to: (1) assign a formulary to all plans that offer Part D and are a part of the contract that submitted the formulary; and (2) assign all formularies submitted for an organization to at least one plan. Further, Chapter 10 provides that one formulary may be mapped to one or more plans. The ability for plans to assign a given formulary to multiple plans reduces Part D sponsor and CMS administrative burden by reducing the number of formularies that CMS must review and Part D sponsors must maintain. \nSince the beginning of the Part D \nprogram, we have interpreted section 1860D\u20132(b) of the Act to provide two distinct types of standard prescription drug coverage\u2014\u2018\u2018Defined Standard coverage\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018actuarially equivalent standard coverage.\u2019\u2019 Section 1860D\u2013 2(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act provides that Part D sponsors offering actuarially equivalent standard coverage will be permitted to substitute cost-sharing requirements (including multi-tier benefit structures tied to Part D plan formularies and particular pharmacies in a Part D plan\u2019s network) for costs above the annual deductible and up to the catastrophic coverage limit, provided that those alternative cost- sharing requirements are actuarially equivalent to an average expected coinsurance of 25 percent for costs above the annual deductible and up to catastrophic coverage. Also, since the beginning of the Part D program, we \nhave interpreted this provision to permit multi-tier benefit structures for actuarially equivalent standard coverage but not for Defined Standard coverage (70 FR 4237). \nAs is noted on page 55 of the Final CY \n2015 Part D Call Letter, for a plan using a formulary (as defined at \u00a7 423.4), we expect that the formulary structure submitted for a plan offering Defined \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39e998bc-1eaf-4d94-a4e1-91c1fb1ff863": {"__data__": {"id_": "39e998bc-1eaf-4d94-a4e1-91c1fb1ff863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03ec287e-c809-43ca-a576-358b9b82e6d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2202dba34aa05c2ee78047bd253b7ae5dfbf4501dd18ab3dc5562a7362ebe544"}, "3": {"node_id": "9725f405-a617-4245-9620-378c2549ade1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d5711007788171413fabcb609323d48e2e404ae2bdf70559842908d3999c0c7b"}}, "hash": "199bfbb995e182a2591b80d4283d9e785db196de910a7eea48ff10676d4834a5", "text": "79588 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n160U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Standard coverage will be consistent \nwith a plan benefit package (PBP) submission that does not include a multi-tier benefit structure. Similarly, we have stated in our Formulary Submission Module and Reports Technical Manual (available at https:// \nwww.cms.gov/files/document/ \ncy2022formularyplanmanual5.pdf) that formularies that will only be associated with plans offering Defined Standard coverage must be submitted as having a single-tier benefit structure. We made an exception to this policy such that if a plan offering Defined Standard coverage uses a formulary that is linked (via the Formulary Crosswalk) to at least one other plan with a multi-tier benefit structure (that is, a plan offering Actuarial Equivalent Standard, Basic Alternative, or Enhanced Alternative coverage). In other words, a given formulary (as defined in \u00a7 423.4) applies to all plans to which such formulary has been assigned, but any submitted multi- tier benefit structures are plan-specific and only apply to the individual plans that offer coverage other than Defined Standard. \nThe Final CY 2015 Part D Call Letter \nalso instructed that all marketing materials for plans offering Defined Standard coverage reflect a single-tier benefit structure regardless of whether such plan offering Defined Standard coverage uses a formulary that is associated with other plans that offer multi-tier benefit structures. \nBecause we continue to receive \nquestions from Part D sponsors about our policy that a plan offering Defined Standard coverage have a single-tier benefit structure, we are taking this opportunity to clarify a common point of confusion by proposing to codify this longstanding subregulatory policy, as summarized below. Additionally, with regard to the formulary crosswalk policy, we have previously used the terms \u2018\u2018associated,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018mapped,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018linked,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018assigned\u2019\u2019 \nsynonymously, but in order to minimize confusion, we have chosen to use the term \u2018\u2018assign\u2019\u2019 in our proposed regulatory requirements. \nFirst, we propose to define the term \n\u2018\u2018formulary crosswalk\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.100 as the process during bid submission by which a formulary (as defined at \u00a7 423.4) is assigned to one or more Part D plans with single- or multi-tier benefit structures. \nSecond, we propose to add new \nparagraph \u00a7 423.120(b)(9) to codify that a Part D plan offering Defined Standard coverage may not apply multi-tier benefit structures to the formulary (as defined at \u00a7 423.4) to which it has been assigned via the formulary crosswalk (as defined at \u00a7 423.100) as part of the bid submission process. We also propose to codify an exception in the case that such formulary has also been assigned to one or more other Part D plans that use multi-tier benefit structures such that the multi-tier benefit structures used by the other Part D plans offering coverage other than Defined Standard coverage would not apply to the plan offering Defined Standard coverage. \nFinally, because various required \nmarketing and communications materials, including (but not limited to) the formulary document, have been redesignated as communications materials, as defined at \u00a7 423.2260, we propose to codify our subregulatory policy that a plan offering Defined Standard coverage display a single-tier benefit structure in all relevant marketing and communications materials.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9725f405-a617-4245-9620-378c2549ade1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9725f405-a617-4245-9620-378c2549ade1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03ec287e-c809-43ca-a576-358b9b82e6d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2202dba34aa05c2ee78047bd253b7ae5dfbf4501dd18ab3dc5562a7362ebe544"}, "2": {"node_id": "39e998bc-1eaf-4d94-a4e1-91c1fb1ff863", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "199bfbb995e182a2591b80d4283d9e785db196de910a7eea48ff10676d4834a5"}}, "hash": "d5711007788171413fabcb609323d48e2e404ae2bdf70559842908d3999c0c7b", "text": "Specifically, at new \u00a7 423.2267(e)(42), we propose to require that, when discussing the Part D plan\u2019s formulary, a plan offering Defined Standard coverage convey that all covered drugs have a single-tier benefit structure. This would be model content included in all relevant communications and marketing materials (as defined at \u00a7 423.2260) that pertain to the formulary or preferential status of the covered Part D drugs\u2014 including the complete and abridged formulary, Summary of Benefits, Evidence of Coverage, and other materials, as applicable. \nWe have been monitoring compliance \nwith this policy via our annual formulary review and approval process, consistent with the requirements at \u00a7 423.120(b). Since this review is already being performed and plans are already in compliance, there is no additional paperwork burden associated with codifying this longstanding subregulatory policy. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nU. Shortages of Formulary Drug \nProducts During a Plan Year (\u00a7 423.120) \nDrug shortages and their impact on \nthe healthcare system have been a concern for decades. FDA reports that drug shortages peaked in 2011 with 251 new shortages, but have since declined to 43 in 2020.\n160Despite this progress, \ndrug shortages received renewed attention as a result of supply chain disruptions during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201319) pandemic. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of \n2020, Congress commissioned the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to examine and report on vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical supply chain.\n161While other \ngovernment agencies pursue strategies to track and mitigate drug shortages, in this proposed rule, we propose to codify existing subregulatory guidance, first released in the July 21, 2009 Health Plan Management System (HPMS) memorandum titled \u2018\u2018Shortages of Formulary Drug Products During a Plan Year\u2019\u2019\n162and subsequently incorporated \ninto chapter 5 of the Prescription Drug Benefit Manual,\n163describing \nexpectations of Part D sponsors when shortages impact drugs on their Part D plan formulary. We also propose to broaden the scope of requirements beyond current guidance to reflect the availability of interchangeable biological products. \nSection 1860D\u201311(e)(2)(D)(i) of the \nAct requires CMS to approve Part D plans only if CMS does not find that the design of the plan and its benefits, including any formulary, are likely to substantially discourage enrollment by certain Part D eligible individuals under the plan. Accordingly, CMS\u2019 annual formulary review and approval process includes extensive checks to ensure adequate representation of all necessary Part D drug categories or classes for the Medicare population. These checks have been previously described in CMS\u2019 January 10, 2014 proposed rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 (79 FR 2019). Such formulary requirements are a beneficiary protection counterbalancing CMS\u2019 statutory prohibition against requiring a particular formulary or interfering with negotiations between Part D sponsors, manufacturers, and pharmacies, consistent with section 1860D\u201311(i) of the Act. Because Part D drug shortages have the potential to undermine the formulary approval process and interrupt beneficiary therapy, CMS is proposing to codify requirements for Part D sponsors relating to formulary drug shortages to mitigate potential disruption. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00138 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc256ebd-1f7a-418e-ac6e-697112f53058": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc256ebd-1f7a-418e-ac6e-697112f53058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cbb557d-d730-4be1-b34d-bf88faf80ca3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eaedb8dcf139d1fa0ca88b6ea44845d79e089d153468ff980a5498ad60f8e0c9"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f40b6fb-2a6a-41ef-b41e-d0e3a7bf6dc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ccb28efe8a9c20b676b52043baea21c55819c67fde308fcd71ec4bfddc92ac14"}}, "hash": "f4b14de969fb9b1d9da1b0920104dbe397d48e3edb53ee2b3a4f6c1d403bddba", "text": "79589 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n16442 CFR 423.120(c)(5)(i). \n165DEA regulations also address requirements \nregarding prescriptions for a controlled substance. \nSee 21 CFR 1306. Existing guidance names FDA as the \ndefinitive source of drug shortage \ninformation. We are therefore proposing to add a new paragraph (g) to \u00a7 423.120 to specify that our proposed drug shortage requirements would apply in the case of shortages listed on the FDA website at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ drug-safety-and-availability/drug- shortages and corresponding database at \nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ drugshortages/default.cfm. If a shortage \nbecomes market withdrawal and therefore the product is no longer listed on the FDA drug shortage website, then the proposed requirements would no longer apply. \nIn order to minimize unnecessary \nchanges in therapy resulting from temporary shortages of multiple-source formulary drug and biological products, we propose at new paragraph \u00a7 423.120(g)(1) to require Part D sponsors to permit enrollees affected by a shortage to obtain coverage for a therapeutically equivalent drug or an interchangeable biological product, if any, for at least the duration of the shortage. As proposed at \u00a7 423.120(g)(1)(i), Part D sponsors would be required to permit enrollees affected by a shortage to obtain coverage for a therapeutically equivalent or interchangeable non-formulary alternative without requiring those enrollees to meet formulary exception requirements at \u00a7 423.578(b). In the case where a therapeutically equivalent or interchangeable alternative is on the formulary but requires prior authorization or step therapy, as proposed at \u00a7 423.120(g)(1)(ii), Part D sponsors would be required to permit enrollees affected by a shortage to obtain coverage for the formulary alternative without requiring those enrollees to satisfy prior authorization or step therapy requirements. \nWhen applicable, Part D sponsors \nshould allow pharmacies to utilize a value of \u2018\u20188\u2019\u2019 (Substitution Allowed\u2014 Generic Drug Not Available in Marketplace) in field 408\u2013D8 (Dispense as Written/Product Selection Code) of the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) version D.0 Telecommunication standard (or the applicable value and version at the time) to specify that an equivalent brand product is being dispensed due to the unavailability of any generic formulary products. Nothing in this proposal supersedes State pharmacy laws, which determine a pharmacist\u2019s authority to automatically substitute therapeutically equivalent drugs or interchangeable biological products for the reference product, or vice versa. A new prescription for the alternative product \nmay be required. \nWe are also proposing, at new \nparagraph (g)(2), to specify that the Part D sponsor would not be required to charge the cost sharing that applies to the unavailable formulary product for the alternative product and may charge the applicable sharing that would apply to the alternative therapeutically equivalent or interchangeable product\u2019s formulary status and the plan benefit design. That is, if the alternative product is on the formulary, the enrollee would be expected to pay the cost sharing that would normally apply based on the plan benefit design and if the alternative product is non- formulary, then the enrollee would be expected to pay the cost sharing associated with formulary exceptions. This policy would not preclude an enrollee affected by a shortage from seeking a formulary exception consistent with \u00a7 423.578(b) to obtain access to a non-formulary product or to a formulary product requiring prior authorization or step therapy beyond the duration of the shortage; nor would this policy preclude enrollees affected by a shortage from seeking a tiering exception, consistent with \u00a7 423.578(a), to obtain access to the alternative formulary product at a more favorable cost sharing. \nUnder the current proposal, Part D \nsponsors would be required to cover a therapeutically equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product as an alternative to the formulary product subject to shortage if there is claim submitted for the alternative.

If a Part D sponsor decides to remove a product from its formulary due to long-term shortage or if the shortage becomes a market withdrawal, the requirements currently codified at \u00a7 423.120(b)(5), which we are proposing to revise as discussed in section III.Q. of this proposed rule, would apply. \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \nV. Validity of DEA Registration Numbers for Controlled Substances (\u00a7 423.120(c)) \nIn this section, we propose to amend \n\u00a7 423.120(c) to codify in regulation our current policy that Part D sponsors must confirm the validity of a prescriber\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number for a controlled substance, if the number is on the drug claim. Or, if the prescriber\u2019s DEA registration number is not on the Part D claim, the sponsor must use prescriber identifier data sources to cross-reference the prescriber\u2019s individual National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, which is required on all Part D drug claims,\n164to the prescriber\u2019s \nDEA registration number for validation. Under \u00a7 423.104(h), a Part D sponsor may provide benefits only for Part D drugs that require a prescription if those drugs are dispensed upon a valid prescription. A \u2018\u2018valid prescription\u2019\u2019 is defined in \u00a7 423.100 as a prescription that complies with all applicable State law requirements constituting a valid prescription. \nPrescriptions are regulated under \nState laws which may incorporate Federal law and regulations.

In addition, we propose that sponsors be required to confirm that the controlled substance prescribed is consistent with the prescriber\u2019s DEA Schedule registration. \nType 1 NPIs are obtained by \nindividual health care providers. (With respect to Part D claims, we refer to them in this section as \u2018\u2018prescriber NPIs\u2019\u2019). Type 2 NPIs are obtained by organization health care providers and organizational health care providers are discussed further below.\n166 \nSection 90.2 of Manual Chapter 5 \nnotes that sources of State and Federal data on providers, in addition to prescriber identifier validation services from commercial vendors, are available to support sponsor efforts at such validation. This means that sponsors can use public and private data when cross-referencing prescriber NPIs to DEA registration numbers, if the prescriber has a DEA registration number. It is our understanding that this is indeed what Part D sponsors and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) currently do\u2014that is, they use databases to cross-reference prescriber NPIs to DEA registration numbers when they receive a Part D claim for a controlled substance. \nWe further propose that if a Part D \nsponsor finds a valid and active DEA registration number for the prescriber of a controlled substance, and an associated schedule that is appropriate for the drug, then the sponsor must process the claim under the other coverage parameters of applicable Part D plan. If the sponsor finds a DEA registration number, but it is not valid or active, or the associated schedule for the drug is not appropriate, the sponsor must reject the claim and send the pharmacy an electronic code with the reason for the rejection. \nWe note that in rejecting the claim, \nthe sponsor should not return the designated code to trigger the delivery of the standardized pharmacy notice to the enrollee, as the claim has been rejected because it does not contain all necessary data elements for adjudication. (See section 40.12.3 -Part D Coverage Determination Notices\u2014in the Parts C&D Enrollee Grievances, Organization/Coverage Determinations, and Appeals Guidance).\n167With respect \nto written member requests for \nreimbursement, we propose that if the Part D sponsor determines that the DEA registration number of the prescriber was not valid or not active or there was not an associated schedule that was consistent with the drug for which the member requested reimbursement, then the Part D sponsor not only must deny the member request for reimbursement, but must also provide the beneficiary with a written notice explaining the coverage determination consistent with the notice requirements at \u00a7 423.568(g). \nIt is our understanding that some \nprescribers, such as hospital residents, prescribe controlled substances under an organizational health care provider\u2019s DEA registration number. We received reports in the past that sponsors were rejecting claims for controlled substances when a prescriber was prescribing under a hospital\u2019s or institution\u2019s DEA registration number, and the prescriber did not have an individual DEA registration number.

In other words, we are proposing that the sponsor must check the validity of the DEA registration number only when there is \nan individual prescriber DEA registration number associated with the Type I NPI on the Part D claim. \nAlthough this proposal would codify \nour current policy, we understand that at least some sponsors reject all claims for controlled substances for which they cannot validate the prescriber\u2019s DEA registration number and schedule. We speculate that these sponsors want to have an electronic record of the pharmacist using an override code to validate that the prescriber is lawfully prescribing controlled substances. We solicit comment on whether we should require sponsors to reject all claims for controlled substances for which they cannot validate the DEA registration number and schedule, and what impact this adjustment in policy would have on beneficiary access to controlled substances covered by Part D, if any. \nWe propose to codify our existing \nDEA registration number policy at \u00a7 423.120 by updating the header for paragraph (c) and by adding a new paragraph (7) as follows: \n\u2022The header of paragraph (c) would \nbe changed to \u2018\u2018Use of standardized technology and identifiers.\u2019\u2019 \n\u2022New paragraph (c)(7)(i) would \nestablish that a D sponsor must attempt to confirm the validity of a prescriber DEA registration number for a pharmacy claim for a Schedule II, III, IV or V drug, and that if the DEA registration number is not on the claim, the sponsor must cross-reference the prescriber\u2019s Type 1 NPI on the claim to any associated individual prescriber DEA number. \n\u2022New paragraphs (c)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) \nwould specify that if the DEA registration number is not valid or active or the DEA registration number does not have an associated Schedule that is consistent with the drug for which a claim was submitted, the Part D sponsor must reject the claim and provide the pharmacy with the electronic reason code when rejecting the claim. \n\u2022New paragraph (7)(iii) would \nspecify that if the pharmacy confirms the validity of the DEA registration number via electronic override code, or the sponsor is not able to cross-reference the Type 1 NPI to a prescriber DEA registration number, the sponsor must process the claim under the applicable benefit plan rules. \n\u2022New paragraph (c)(7)(iv) would \nspecify that, with respect to written member requests for reimbursement, the Part D sponsor must determine whether the DEA registration number of the prescriber was valid and active for the date of service, and if the DEA registration number had an associated Schedule that was consistent with the drug for which the member request for reimbursement was submitted for the date of service.

Codifying Current Part D Transition \nand Continuity of Care Policies (\u00a7\u00a7 423.100 and \u00a7 423.120) \n1. Overview and Summary \nUnder \u00a7 423.120(b)(3), Part D sponsors \nmust provide certain enrollees a \ntransition fill to avoid interruption in drug therapy when a drug is non- formulary, or on-formulary but subject to utilization management (UM) restrictions, so that the enrollee has time to switch to a therapeutic alternative drug or complete an exception request to maintain coverage of an existing drug based on medical necessity reasons. Thus, the purpose of providing a transition supply is to promote continuity of care and avoid interruptions in drug therapy.\n169 \nSponsors must also send enrollees a notice when they provide a transition fill. \nThe Part D transition requirement was \nfirst codified in our January 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR 4194)\n170under the \nauthority of section 1860D\u201311(d)(2)(B) of the Act, which provides CMS with authority similar to that provided to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management with respect to health benefit plans to prescribe reasonable minimum standards for health benefits plans. We noted in that final rule that failure to appropriately transition certain beneficiaries could result in aggravation of certain medical conditions including, in some cases, hospitalization, which could ultimately increase costs to Medicare under Parts A and B (70 FR 4264). \nPart D transition guidance is \ncontained in Chapter 6 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual (Manual Chapter 6),\n171Section 30.4\u2014 Part D Drugs and Formulary Requirements. While most of the transition requirements are codified at \u00a7 423.120(b), there are some aspects of the current guidance in section 30.4 of Manual Chapter 6 that are not. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to codify those aspects of the current Part D transition guidance in regulation. In some cases, as detailed later in this section, our proposed regulation would clarify the policies reflected in current guidance. \nSpecifically, we propose to codify our \npolicies with respect to the following topics: 1) quantity limits (QLs); 2) the minimum 108-day lookback period; 3) P&T committee role in transition; 4) transition notice timeframes; 5) level of care changes; and 6) (LTC) emergency supply. \n2. Quantity Limits (QLs) During \nTransition \nCurrently, under \u00a7 423.120(b)(3), a \nsponsor is required to provide for an appropriate transition for an enrollee if the Part D drug is on the plan\u2019s formulary but requires prior authorization or step therapy. We propose to add to \u00a7 423.120(b)(3) that certain quantity limits (QLs) would require a sponsor to provide for an appropriate transition for an enrollee if the Part D drug is on the plan\u2019s formulary. This proposal, if finalized, would apply both for a current enrollee when a QL has been added to a drug on the plan\u2019s formulary that is lower than the beneficiary\u2019s current dose, and for a new enrollee when an existing QL for a formulary drug is lower than the beneficiary\u2019s current dose.

We believe it is necessary to continue to allow \u2018\u2018safety-based claim edits\u2019\u2019 that are QLs to be applied to transition fills, because not allowing them would mean that enrollees could obtain transition fills that were unsafe or were inappropriate drug use under standard DUR reviews. This approach is consistent with our current transition policy in Manual Chapter 6, Section 30.4.8. We propose to add a definition of \n\u2018\u2018safety-based claim edit\u2019\u2019 to \u00a7 423.100.

We solicit comment on this proposal. \n3. Minimum 108-Day Lookback Period \nUnder our current regulations at \n\u00a7 423.120(b)(3), Part D sponsors must \nprovide for an appropriate transition process for certain enrollees. We have consistently interpreted an appropriate transition to be required for ongoing therapy\u2014that is, when an enrollee is receiving a drug for the first time, there is nothing to transition from, and therefore a transition supply is not necessary. Therefore, in providing for appropriate transition, it is necessary for Part D sponsors to determine whether an enrollee is receiving a new prescription or a refill for ongoing therapy, and we have long recognized that distinguishing between \u2018\u2018new starts\u2019\u2019 and ongoing therapy may be difficult. \nAs described in Section 30.4.3 of \nManual Chapter 6, our longstanding Part D policy for distinguishing between new starts and ongoing therapy has been to treat all prescriptions that could qualify for a transition as ongoing therapy unless the sponsor can make the distinction at the point of sale. More recently, Section 30.4 was updated to specify that when sponsors are able to access prior drug claims history for an enrollee of an affiliated plan, a minimum of a 108-day lookback is typically needed to adequately document ongoing drug therapy. That is, if a 108-day lookback does not show claims history for the drug for the beneficiary, the Part D sponsor treats it as a first fill, and does not provide a transition supply. \nA 108-day lookback for this purpose \naccounts for the enrollee having a quantity of a Part D drug on hand prior to requesting a subsequent fill\u2014 meaning that CMS calculates the quantity on hand by assuming the enrollee has a 20 percent remaining balance of a previously dispensed 90- day supply prior to receiving a subsequent 90-day supply leading up to their transition period. The enrollee could have a total of 108 days supply on hand to use before they would need a transition supply and no claims for the drug during that 108-day period. Thus, on day 109, the sponsor would need to look back 108 days to catch the enrollee\u2019s last refill for the drug, which \ndemonstrates ongoing therapy. \nWe propose to codify our policy by \nrequiring at \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B) that, if a Part D sponsor has access to prior drug claims history for the enrollee (through an affiliated plan or otherwise), the sponsor must use a minimum 108-day claims history lookback period to determine at point- of-sale whether a pharmacy claim represents a new prescription which would not require a transition fill, or ongoing drug therapy which would require a transition fill. If a Part D sponsor does not have access to prior claims history for the enrollee and cannot determine at point-of-sale whether a pharmacy claim represents a new prescription or ongoing therapy, the sponsor must treat the prescription as ongoing therapy which would require a transition fill. \n4. Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) \nCommittee Role in Transition \nSection 30.1.7 of Manual Chapter 6 \naddresses the P&T Committee\u2019s role in transition. Last updated in 2008, some \nof its language is outdated vis-a-vis the current transition requirements of \u00a7 423.120(b)(3). However, we do wish to codify the P&T committee\u2019s role in transition. As Manual Chapter 6 states, CMS looks to transition process submissions for assurances that a sponsor\u2019s P&T Committee will review and provide recommendations regarding the transition procedures. The manual guidance states the rationale for this policy\u2014because a Part D sponsor\u2019s P&T committee must include a majority of members who are practicing physicians and/or pharmacists under \u00a7 423.120(b), when the sponsor\u2019s P&T committee reviews a sponsor\u2019s transition procedures, it ensures that persons with medical and pharmaceutical expertise have reviewed such procedures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a565465f-1a08-43bf-ac3e-962395e3f89a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a565465f-1a08-43bf-ac3e-962395e3f89a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f0aec09-d4fb-4244-985c-ea9bb57dfb06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "eb320679ac9d02c590295f4c01d331dbf77e793672e8e9fea95636ec56342a65"}, "2": {"node_id": "1069052e-a2c2-49be-b4d8-c0a583086c7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d4f6580b59b44a44cff6a9767bf2cef35cd5801876905f3b1447d15531490651"}}, "hash": "d24f9b92711bedf69423d8feaf2a243cc9dd2a80d63bea867e0f72b17efdfcd6", "text": "We propose to codify this policy by \nadding new \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(viii) to require that the Part D sponsor\u2019s transition policies and procedures include assurances that the Part D sponsor\u2019s P&T Committee has reviewed, provided recommendations as warranted, and approved the plan\u2019s transition policies and procedures to comply with \u00a7 423.120(b)(3). We further propose to codify our current subregulatory guidance that such policies and procedures must be submitted through a process specified by CMS as part of the plan\u2019s annual bid. \n5. Timing Clarifications for Transition \nNotices \nSection 30.4.10 of Manual Chapter 6 \nprovides guidance on transition notices, which must be sent by the Part D \nsponsor to the affected enrollee within 3 business days after adjudication of the temporary transition fill, in accordance with \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(iv). We have received questions about how to calculate the three business days. While we have not previously provided specific guidance about this issue, we propose to specify in \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(iv) that the first business day after adjudication of the transition fill\u2014that is, the processing of the claim\u2014counts \nas business day 1. For example: \n\u2022Claim adjudication occurs on either \nFriday, May 3, Saturday May 4, or Sunday, May 5. \n\u2022Monday, May 6 at 11:59 p.m. is the \nend of business day 1. \n\u2022Tuesday, May 7 at 11:59 p.m. is the \nend of business day 2. \n\u2022Wednesday, May 8 at 11:59 p.m. is \nthe end of business day 3 and the deadline for sending the notice in this example. \n6. Level of Care Changes \nSection 30.4.7 of Manual Chapter 6 \ndescribes unplanned circumstances for \ncurrent enrollees that can arise in which current drug regimens are not on sponsors\u2019 formularies. These circumstances usually involve level of care changes in which a beneficiary is changing from one treatment setting to another. For example, this includes beneficiaries who are discharged from a hospital to a home; end their skilled nursing facility Medicare Part A stay (where pharmacy charges were covered as part of the stay) and need to obtain their medications from their Part D plan thereafter; give up hospice status to revert to standard Medicare Part A and B benefits; end an LTC facility stay and return to the community; or are discharged from psychiatric hospitals with drug regimens that are highly individualized. \nThese admission and discharge \nscenarios potentially involve circumstances in which an enrollee\u2019s prescriptions are adjusted as they move through the health care system, and such adjusted prescriptions may include drugs that are not on a sponsor\u2019s formulary, or are on a sponsor\u2019s formulary but require prior authorization, step therapy, or are subject to an approved QL lower than the enrollee\u2019s current dose that is not a safety-based claim edit, as proposed at paragraph \u00a7 423.120(b)(3). Thus, these scenarios could involve interruptions in ongoing drug therapy for a Part D beneficiary. \nSection 30.4.7 acknowledges that \nwhile Part A does provide reimbursement for \u2018\u2018a limited supply\u2019\u2019 to \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00142 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9e9c17c-6b3e-4fa5-9d76-d9ae82b068c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9e9c17c-6b3e-4fa5-9d76-d9ae82b068c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63f547c9-2481-4490-b496-0bc1ab9ac85d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "068a23da752806617455e0aa311ceba0c6f6f85704512b3fa6b4ac215d0d89ac"}, "3": {"node_id": "f58bc076-d1d1-4313-b958-67214eace09f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0cbb45e8082784557982882fafbd79fc38fc525e2b1bffe901f3993f9e1e11e8"}}, "hash": "e818f61d2671645ca6fa3d5a0f40abf200b520005c7cf9b14ba834139ec05d9d", "text": "79593 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n172https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider- \nEnrollment-and-Certification/ \nGuidanceforLawsAndRegulations/Downloads/ Appendix-PP-State-Operations-Manual.pdf. facilitate beneficiary discharge, \nbeneficiaries need to have a full outpatient supply available to continue therapy once this limited supply is exhausted. The guidance further notes that this is particularly true for beneficiaries using mail-order pharmacy services, using home infusion therapy, or residing in rural areas where obtaining a continuing supply of drugs may involve certain delays. \nFor these reasons, we propose at new \nparagraph \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(i)(A)(5) to require Part D sponsors to apply their transition processes to current enrollees experiencing a level of care change, such as admission or discharge from a hospital, skilled nursing facility, long- term care facility, and hospice. This would mean that, pursuant to \u00a7 423.120(b)(3), a Part D sponsor must provide for an appropriate transition process for enrollees experiencing a level of care change who are prescribed Part D drugs that are not on a sponsor\u2019s formulary, or are on a sponsor\u2019s formulary but require prior authorization, step therapy, or are, as proposed in section W.2. of this proposed rule, subject to a quantity limit that is not a safety-based claim edit as defined in \u00a7 423.100. \nHowever, acknowledging that a Part D \nsponsor may not have access to information about an enrollee\u2019s level of care changes, we propose new \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(i)(A)(5) to specify that the sponsor would have to apply its transition process to enrollees experiencing a level of care change only if the sponsor were notified of such change by the enrollee or their representative, their prescriber, the hospital or facility, or a pharmacy before or at the time of the request for the fill referenced in \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(iii). Such notification could be by electronic messaging. \n7. LTC Emergency Supply \nSection 30.4.6 of Manual Chapter 6 \nstates, that as a matter of general \npractice, LTC facility residents need to receive their medications as ordered without delay. This is because the requirements for LTC facilities at \u00a7 483.45 state that the facility must provide routine and emergency drugs and biologicals to its residents, or obtain them under an agreement described in \u00a7 483.70(g). Section 483.45(a) also requires that a facility provide pharmaceutical services (including procedures that assure the accurate acquiring, receiving, dispensing, and administering of all drugs and biologicals) to meet the needs of each resident. The State Operations Manual \nAppendix PP\u2014Guidance to Surveyors for Long Term Care Facilities (Rev. 11\u2013 22\u201317)\n172contains guidance for \ncomplying with \u00a7 483.45. Paragraph A on page 455 of this guidance, titled \u2018\u2018Provision of Routine and/or Emergency Medications\u2019\u2019 states, \u2018\u2018The regulation at \u00a7 483.45 requires that the facility provide or obtain routine and emergency medications and biologicals in order to meet the needs of each resident . . . Whether prescribed on a routine, emergency, or as needed basis, medications should be administered in a timely manner. Delayed acquisition of a medication may impede timely administration and adversely affect a resident\u2019s condition.\u2019\u2019 \nAccordingly, our longstanding policy \nin section 30.4.6 has been that Part D sponsors must also cover emergency supplies of new starts of non-formulary Part D drugs for LTC facility residents, outside of any respective transition periods for them, while an exception or prior authorization request is being processed. We propose to codify this requirement. Specifically, we propose to add a paragraph (8) to \u00a7 423.120(b) that would require a Part D sponsor to cover such an emergency supply during any portion of the plan year when the enrollee did not otherwise qualify for a transition fill under \u00a7 423.120(b)(3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f58bc076-d1d1-4313-b958-67214eace09f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f58bc076-d1d1-4313-b958-67214eace09f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63f547c9-2481-4490-b496-0bc1ab9ac85d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "068a23da752806617455e0aa311ceba0c6f6f85704512b3fa6b4ac215d0d89ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9e9c17c-6b3e-4fa5-9d76-d9ae82b068c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e818f61d2671645ca6fa3d5a0f40abf200b520005c7cf9b14ba834139ec05d9d"}}, "hash": "0cbb45e8082784557982882fafbd79fc38fc525e2b1bffe901f3993f9e1e11e8", "text": "Additionally, we propose that for purposes of a LTC emergency fill requirement, \u2018\u2018non-formulary\u2019\u2019 would have the same meaning as it does for transition fills at paragraph (b)(3)\u2014that is, a non-formulary drug also means drugs that are on the Part D plan\u2019s formulary (including Part D drugs that are on a sponsor\u2019s formulary but require prior authorization, step therapy, or are subject to a QL that is not a safety-based claim edit as defined in \u00a7 423.100 under the plan\u2019s drug utilization management rules). Also, in \u00a7 423.120(b)(8), we propose that this emergency supply must be for at least 31 days of medication, regardless of dispensing increments, unless the prescription is written by a prescriber for less than 31 days. \n8. Summary of Proposals \nIn summary, we are proposing to \ncodify current Part D transition \nguidance at \u00a7 423.120(b) as follows: \n\u2022Specify at paragraph (b)(3) that, for \ntransition purposes, non-formulary drugs include drugs that are on the sponsor\u2019s formulary but are subject to a QL that is not a safety-based claim edit \nas we propose to define that term in \u00a7 423.100; and make a conforming change to \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(iii) to include a reference to QLs. \n\u2022Add new paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A) to \nrequire that if a Part D sponsor has access to prior drug claims history for the enrollee (through an affiliated plan or otherwise), the sponsor must use a minimum 108-day claims history lookback period to determine whether a pharmacy claim represents a new prescription which would not require a transition fill, or ongoing drug therapy which would require a transition fill. Paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(B) would state that if a Part D sponsor does not have access to prior claims history for the enrollee and cannot determine at point-of-sale whether a pharmacy claim represents a new prescription or ongoing therapy, the sponsor must treat the prescription as ongoing therapy which requires a transition fill. \n\u2022Add new paragraph (b)(3)(viii) to \nrequire that the Part D sponsor\u2019s transition policies and procedures include assurances that the Part D sponsor\u2019s P&T Committee has reviewed, provided recommendations as warranted, and approved the plan\u2019s transition policies and procedures to comply with \u00a7 423.120(b)(3), and that such policies and procedures must be \nsubmitted through a process specified by CMS as part of the plan\u2019s annual bid. \n\u2022Specify at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) that \nthe first business day after adjudication of the transition fill counts as business day 1 for purposes of determining when a transition notice must be provided to an enrollee. \n\u2022Add new paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A)(5) to \ninclude a new group of enrollees experiencing a level of care change, to which a Part D sponsor\u2019s transition process must apply, if the sponsor is notified of such change by the enrollee or their representative, their prescriber, the hospital or facility, or a pharmacy before or at the time of the request for the fill referenced in \u00a7 423.120(b)(3)(iii). \nIn addition, we propose to codify our \ncurrent long-term care (LTC) emergency supply guidance as follows: \n\u2022Add new paragraph \u00a7 423.120(b)(8) \nto codify a requirement that a Part D sponsor must cover an emergency supply of a non-formulary Part D drug for a long-term care facility resident after their respective transition period, including Part D drugs that are on a sponsor\u2019s formulary but under a plan\u2019s drug utilization management rules, require prior authorization, step therapy, or are subject to a quantity limit that is not a safety-based claim edit as defined in \u00a7 423.100. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00143 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b508713e-3c0c-470f-885e-25684297e380": {"__data__": {"id_": "b508713e-3c0c-470f-885e-25684297e380", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b77ca572-5e4f-47aa-a9b6-7c2f14f66fb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d794e0ddb3e8e7ee1ef52bc2447c95297ad4138e2a11eed1982d44003add7c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "be866a53-cd81-4c54-ad2f-4beb61a2c7d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a5b844ea334b9691471a758dbfbd275cb5710a54bb706b819681ea0114ad650f"}}, "hash": "7662a163e3d150d1e67dda0072d33007348f2b5e1ddb6650b6232c1a3957f20c", "text": "79594 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAs the foregoing describes our \nproposal to codify existing guidance \nwith which we believe Part D sponsors are currently complying, we conclude that there is no additional paperwork burden for sponsors from this proposal. \nWe solicit comments on these \nproposals. \nX. Update of Terminology to \n\u2018\u2018Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 423.154) \nFollowing the passage of Rosa\u2019s Law \n(Pub. L. 111\u2013256) in 2010, CMS updated references in CMS regulations to the term \u2018\u2018mentally retarded\u2019\u2019 (MR) and replaced that term with the term \u2018\u2018individuals with intellectual disabilities\u2019\u2019 (IID) in the \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Program; Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency, and Burden Reduction\u2019\u2019 final rule which appeared in the Federal Register on May 16, 2012 \n(77 FR 29001). This global terminology change included updating the definition at \u00a7 435.1010 of individuals receiving active treatment in \u2018\u2018intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded\u2019\u2019 (ICF/MR),\u2019\u2019 changing the term for the facility to \u2018\u2018intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\u2019\u2019 However, at that time, we inadvertently neglected to update the Part D regulation at \u00a7 423.154(c), which provides a waiver for certain requirements regarding dispensing Part D drugs to individuals in intermediate care facilities (ICFs) \u2018\u2018for the mentally retarded . . . as defined in \u00a7 435.1010\u2019\u2019 that otherwise apply to other types of long-term care facilities. \nAdditionally, in the \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Contract Year 2016 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 final rule which appeared in the Federal Register on February 12, 2015 (80 FR \n7911), we updated the abbreviation in regulation text in \u00a7 423.154 from ICFs/ MR to ICFs/IID, but inadvertently neglected to change the corresponding text in the regulation from which the abbreviation derives. \nConsequently, we are taking this \nopportunity to update the current language at \u00a7 423.154(c) (that is, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded) with the abbreviation (that is, ICFs/IID) and the definition at \u00a7 435.1010. We propose to replace the term \u2018\u2018the mentally retarded\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.154(c) with \u2018\u2018individuals with intellectual disabilities.\u2019\u2019 \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. Y. Technical Correction To Restore the Substantial Difference Requirement (\u00a7 423.265) \nWe are proposing to make a technical \ncorrection to \u00a7 423.265(b)(2) to restore language on requirements for substantial differences between Medicare Part D sponsors\u2019 bids that was inadvertently removed in a recent revision of the section. \nSection 1857(e)(1) of the Act \nauthorizes us to establish contract terms that CMS finds \u2018\u2018necessary and appropriate.\u2019\u2019 Section 1860D\u2013 11(d)(2)(B) of the Act requires us to promulgate \u2018\u2018reasonable minimum standards\u2019\u2019 for Part D sponsors through regulations. Accordingly, we added language to the regulatory text at \u00a7 423.265(b) to require Part D bid submissions to reflect substantial differences in benefit packages or plan costs as part of the \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 final rule, which appeared in the Federal Register on April 15, 2010 (75 FR 19678). \nAdditionally, in the \u2018\u2018Medicare \nProgram; Contract Year 2019 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-Service, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program\u2019\u2019 final rule, which appeared in the Federal Register on April 16, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the April 2018 final rule, 73 FR 16440), we reorganized paragraph (b)(2) to incorporate a general rule in paragraph (b)(2)(i) and an exception in paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the latter of which excluded enhanced alternative plan bid submissions from the substantial difference requirement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be866a53-cd81-4c54-ad2f-4beb61a2c7d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "be866a53-cd81-4c54-ad2f-4beb61a2c7d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b77ca572-5e4f-47aa-a9b6-7c2f14f66fb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d794e0ddb3e8e7ee1ef52bc2447c95297ad4138e2a11eed1982d44003add7c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b508713e-3c0c-470f-885e-25684297e380", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7662a163e3d150d1e67dda0072d33007348f2b5e1ddb6650b6232c1a3957f20c"}}, "hash": "a5b844ea334b9691471a758dbfbd275cb5710a54bb706b819681ea0114ad650f", "text": "We added language placing limits on \nthe number of Part D plan offerings as part of the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2022 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicaid Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on January 19, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as the January 2021 final rule, 86 FR 5864). However, the new language was incorrectly added to \u00a7 423.265(b)(2) rather than \u00a7 423.256(b)(3), and the previous regulatory text on substantial differences was inadvertently overwritten. To correct this inadvertent deletion, we propose to: \n\u2022Redesignate the regulatory text from \nour January 2021 final rule limiting the number of bids a Part D plan sponsor \nmay submit currently at \u00a7 423.265(b)(2) as \u00a7 423.265(b)(3); \n\u2022Restore the language from our April \n2018 final rule on substantial differences at \u00a7 423.265(b)(2)(i) and (ii); and \n\u2022Redesignate the regulatory text \ncurrently at \u00a7 423.265(b)(3) as paragraph (b)(4). \nAs described previously, all of the \nregulatory language that we propose to restore at \u00a7 423.265(b)(2) has previously undergone the full notice and comment process. This proposal would merely correct a technical error made by the January 2021 final rule. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \nZ. Part D Global and Targeted \nReopenings (\u00a7\u00a7 423.308 423.346) \nPursuant to the authority under \nsection 1860D\u201315(f)(1)(B) of the Act, the Secretary has the right to inspect and audit any books and records of a Part D sponsor or MA organization regarding costs provided to the Secretary. We \nstated in the January 2005 Part D final rule (70 FR 4194, 4316) that this right to inspect and audit would not be meaningful, if upon finding mistakes pursuant to such audits, the Secretary was not able to reopen final determinations made on payment. Therefore, we established a reopening provision at \u00a7 423.346 that would allow us to ensure that the discovery of any payment issues could be rectified. In the January 2005 Part D final rule, we established that a reopening was at our discretion and could occur for any reason within 12 months of the final determination of payment, within 4 years for good cause, or at any time when there is fraud or similar fault. We operationalized this provision by conducting program-wide reopenings (that is, global reopenings) and, when necessary, reopenings targeted to specific sponsors\u2019 contracts (that is, targeted reopenings). \nIn this proposed rule, we propose to \ncodify the definitions of \u2018\u2018global reopening\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018targeted reopening.\u2019\u2019 We also propose to modify the timeframe for performing a reopening for good cause from within 4 years to within 6 years to align with the 6-year overpayment look-back period described at \u00a7 423.360(f) and to help ensure that payment issues, including overpayments, can be rectified. In addition, we propose to codify the circumstances under which CMS will notify the sponsor(s) of our intention to perform a reopening and the requirement for CMS to announce when it has completed a reopening. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffab9c49-1a35-4dfa-9b2c-60c2891bbef8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffab9c49-1a35-4dfa-9b2c-60c2891bbef8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "535b24b3-635d-45e1-9b04-33de2c3c0ee7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ad5d5ce3b99a1ed90e96b31c00c414e155865d7738a4191d376add442c162cf7"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b9da41b-a7e3-4583-ac5a-ea5ede090ac0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "66629d09fb01304e135831739005b1f24188a1bcf4875cd020edabbd9ac19353"}}, "hash": "c724ad0ad92231cf8bd9b95b800d8e2a3873bb8a00d8af214ddf965b3bab3acb", "text": "79595 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n1. Summary of the Current Process \nUnder the current process and under \n\u00a7 423.346, CMS performs a reopening of \na Part D payment reconciliation (that is, the initial payment determination) as a result of substantial revisions of prescription drug event (PDE) data and/ or direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) data due to plan corrections, CMS corrections of systems errors, post reconciliation claims activity, and audit and other post reconciliation oversight activity. Based on our experience in the Part D program and the changes that we observed in the PDE and DIR data, we understood when we established this process that we would need to perform a reopening of the initial payment determination for every contract year. \nBy calendar year 2013, CMS had \ncompleted reopenings of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Part D payment reconciliations and began our pattern of completing reopenings for subsequent Part D payment reconciliations approximately 4 years after the completion of each Part D payment reconciliation (consistent with the timing described at \u00a7 423.346(a)(2)). These reopenings included all Part D contracts that met the following criteria: (1) were in effect during the contract year being reopened, and (2) were either in effect at the time CMS completed the reopening or, if nonrenewed or terminated pursuant to \u00a7 423.507 through \u00a7 423.510 (collectively referred to as \u2018\u2018terminated\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of the proposed rule), had not completed the final settlement process by the time CMS completed the reopening. CMS has referred to this type of program-wide reopening as a \u2018\u2018global reopening.\u2019\u2019 See, for example, HPMS memorandum, \u2018\u2018Reopening of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Part D Payment Reconciliations,\u2019\u2019 April 2, 2012 (available at https://www.cms.gov/httpseditcmsgovresearch- statistics-data-and-systemscomputer- data-and-systemshpmshpms-memos- archive/hpms-memos-2012-qtrs-1-4). \nIn addition to \u2018\u2018global reopenings,\u2019\u2019 \nCMS has performed reopenings as part of our process to correct certain issues. We would consider performing a reopening to correct issues such as those associated with CMS-identified problems with an internal CMS file that CMS used in a Part D payment reconciliation, a coverage gap discount program reconciliation, or a reopening; CMS corrections to a PDE edit that impacted a specific plan type (for example, EGWPs); fraud or similar fault of the Part D sponsor or any subcontractor of the Part D sponsor; or a Part D sponsor\u2019s successful appeal of a reconciliation result. See, for example, HPMS memorandum, \u2018\u2018Second \nreopening of the 2011 Final Part D Payment Reconciliation,\u2019\u2019 July 7, 2017 (available at https://www.cms.gov/ Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/ Computer-Data-and-Systems/HPMS/ HPMS-Memos-Archive-Annual-Items/ SysHPMS-Memo-Archive-%3F-2017- Qtr3) and HPMS memorandum, \u2018\u2018Reopening of the 2014 Final Part D Reconciliation for Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs),\u2019\u2019 January 11, 2017 (available at https://www.cms.gov/ Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/ Computer-Data-and-Systems/HPMS/ HPMS-Memos-Archive-Annual-Items/ SysHPMS-Memo-Archive-%3F-2017- Qtr1). These reopenings are not program-wide, but rather are targeted to the Part D contracts that are impacted by the particular issue that needs to be addressed by CMS (that is, \u2018\u2018targeted reopenings\u2019\u2019). The targeted reopenings are not performed on a predictable schedule, and instead are utilized by CMS in the confines on the reopening timeframes described in the current regulation at \u00a7 423.346(a)(1) through (3). \nAlthough in our most recent \nexperience, CMS has utilized targeted reopenings as part of our process to correct certain issues (described above), under the current process, if a particular issue was program-wide, CMS would perform a global reopening to address that issue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b9da41b-a7e3-4583-ac5a-ea5ede090ac0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b9da41b-a7e3-4583-ac5a-ea5ede090ac0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "535b24b3-635d-45e1-9b04-33de2c3c0ee7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ad5d5ce3b99a1ed90e96b31c00c414e155865d7738a4191d376add442c162cf7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffab9c49-1a35-4dfa-9b2c-60c2891bbef8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c724ad0ad92231cf8bd9b95b800d8e2a3873bb8a00d8af214ddf965b3bab3acb"}}, "hash": "66629d09fb01304e135831739005b1f24188a1bcf4875cd020edabbd9ac19353", "text": "This global reopening could be in addition to the scheduled global reopening that CMS has performed approximately four years after the Part D payment reconciliation for that year. \n2. Aligning the Timing of Reopenings to \nthe Overpayment Look-Back Period \nPursuant to the current \n\u00a7 423.346(a)(2), CMS may reopen and revise an initial or reconsidered final payment determination within 4 years after the date of the notice of the initial or reconsidered determination to the \nPart D sponsor, upon establishment of good cause for reopening. As already discussed, this paragraph (a)(2) has set up our current global reopening schedule. CMS performs the Part D payment reconciliation (that is, the initial payment determination) for a contract year, and then within four years of announcing the completion of that reconciliation, we perform a global reopening on that contract year. \nThis reopening process is used to \nrecoup overpayments associated with PDE and DIR related overpayments. Pursuant to the current overpayment provision at \u00a7 423.360(f), there is a \u2018\u2018look-back period\u2019\u2019 in which a Part D sponsor must report and return any overpayment identified within the 6 most recent completed payment years. As described at \u00a7 423.360, an \noverpayment occurs after the \u2018\u2018applicable reconciliation.\u2019\u2019 The applicable reconciliation refers to the deadlines for submitting data for the Part D payment reconciliation. \nThe following example illustrates the \ntiming of look-back period. The deadlines for submitting data for the 2021 Part D payment reconciliation were in June 2022. Prior to the deadlines for submitting data for the 2021 Part D payment reconciliation, a PDE or DIR related overpayment could not exist for 2021, and the latest year for which an overpayment could occur was 2020. Therefore, prior to the deadlines for submitting data for the 2021 Part D payment reconciliation, the look-back period was 2015\u20132020. \nThis 6-year look-back period along \nwith the 4-year reopening timeframe described at \u00a7 423.346(a)(2) results in overpayments being reported for a contract year after CMS has performed the global reopening for that contract year. Continuing from the example above, if a Part D sponsor identified a PDE or DIR related overpayment associated with contract year 2016 in May 2022 (that is, prior to the deadlines for submitting data for the 2021 Part D payment reconciliation), that overpayment falls within the 2015\u20132020 look-back period, and the sponsor would have reported the overpayment to CMS mid-2022. However, CMS completed the global reopening of the 2016 Part D payment reconciliation in January 2022. This discrepancy between the 4-year reopening timeframe and the 6-year overpayment look-back period results in operational challenges for CMS, discussed below. \nCMS had described a process for \nrecouping PDE and DIR related overpayments after the global reopening for the contract year at issue had been completed. In the preamble to our final rule, \u2018\u2018Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs,\u2019\u2019 79 FR 29843 (May 23, 2014) and in subsequent subregulatory guidance, we stated that overpayments reported after the global reopening would be reported by the sponsor with an auditable estimate and that CMS would recoup the overpayment by either requesting a \ncheck or offsetting monthly prospective payments for the amount provided in the auditable estimate. See HPMS memorandum, \u2018\u2018Reopening Process and Updates to the PDE/DIR-related Overpayment Reporting,\u2019\u2019 April 6, 2018 (available at https://www.cms.gov/ Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/ Computer-Data-and-Systems/HPMS/ \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00145 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77e6998d-8af7-4b12-9c44-ca196938fc26": {"__data__": {"id_": "77e6998d-8af7-4b12-9c44-ca196938fc26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5874d25c-1d51-49e1-9e89-24f20ddc7728", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "edced12f86bc1647ea36cc3eabf09a4a29e36cbd33bba226b9f49507efcf103c"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e404a67-457f-4471-b8e7-b1950d123e52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c9842e4cf160208dfc78282b4969a9a4138b7b4da33e91681d9ec719ce749156"}}, "hash": "7421589178ad5d6367d24a663c106e00657e3a2318ff0c0215be18af958f2a90", "text": "79596 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nHPMS-Memos-Archive-Weekly-Items/ \nSysHPMS-Memo-2018-Week1-Apr-2-6). For PDE and DIR related overpayments, that approach presents challenges primarily because sponsors have also reported PDE and DIR related underpayments after the global reopening, which we do not have a method to process other than the reopening process. \nWe have contemplated doing targeted \nreopenings to reconcile the changes in PDE and DIR data, but that also presents operational challenges. Targeted reopenings are conducted using the same payment reconciliation system that conducts the Part D payment reconciliation, the coverage gap discount program reconciliation, and the scheduled global reopening. Given the volume of reporting after the scheduled global reopening, it would be challenging to find the time and resources to run multiple targeted reopenings. \nTherefore, we propose to modify \n\u00a7 423.346(a)(2) such that CMS may reopen and revise an initial or reconsidered final payment determination after the 12-month period (described at \u00a7 423.346(a)(1)), but within 6 years after the date of the notice of the initial or reconsidered determination to the Part D sponsor, upon establishment of good cause for reopening. This proposed change will allow CMS to process all changes to PDE data and DIR data after the overpayment look-back period for a contract year. Once a contract year falls outside the look-back period, we would perform the global reopening for that contract year within the new proposed 6-year timeframe, and in doing so, would recoup the PDE and DIR related overpayments reported by sponsors for that contract year (as well as process underpayments). \nShould this proposal be adopted, \nCMS will provide operational guidance, as we have with every regularly scheduled global reopening. The following example describes the proposed timing for performing the scheduled global reopening. The data for the 2020 Part D payment reconciliation was due June 2021. That reconciliation was completed November 2021. Assuming the current 4-year schedule, the DIR data for the contract year 2020 global reopening would be \ndue to CMS by the end of July 2025, PDE data would be due September 2025, and the 2020 global reopening would be completed the end of 2025 or early 2026. However, the 2020 contract year remains in the overpayment look-back period through June 2027. Under the proposed 6-year timeframe, data for the 2020 global reopening would be due middle to late 2027, and the global \nreopening would be completed late 2027 or early 2028, after the 6-year look- back period. \n3. Standards for Performing Global and \nTargeted Reopenings \nConsistent with the existing \nregulation at \u00a7 423.346(a) and (d), reopenings are at CMS\u2019 discretion. Under the current process, CMS has used its discretion to perform a scheduled global reopening on a Part D payment reconciliation within the timeframe specified at \u00a7 423.346(a)(2). Given the significant time and the costs associated with conducting a reopening, it is expected that CMS will use its discretion to conduct a targeted reopening (or an additional global reopening for a program-wide issue) only under limited circumstances. We would contemplate using our discretion to perform a targeted reopening (or an additional global reopening) to correct or rectify a CMS file or CMS-created PDE edit-type issue, revise a payment determination that was based on PDE and/or DIR data that was submitted due to fraudulent activity of the sponsor or the sponsor\u2019s contractor, or pursuant to a successful appeal under \u00a7 423.350. CMS will not use its discretion to conduct a reopening to reconcile data that will be, or should have been, reconciled in the scheduled global reopening, which would include data from plan corrections, claims activity, and audits that were completed after the deadline for submitting data for the scheduled global reopening. In addition, we are unlikely to conduct a reopening solely pursuant to a sponsor\u2019s request. First, we propose that in order to be included in a reopening, a contract must have been in effect (that is, receiving monthly prospective payments and submitting PDE data for service dates in that year) for the contract year being reopened. Intuitively, if a contract was not in the reconciliation for a particular contract year, it cannot be included in the reopening of that contract year\u2019s reconciliation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e404a67-457f-4471-b8e7-b1950d123e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e404a67-457f-4471-b8e7-b1950d123e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5874d25c-1d51-49e1-9e89-24f20ddc7728", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "edced12f86bc1647ea36cc3eabf09a4a29e36cbd33bba226b9f49507efcf103c"}, "2": {"node_id": "77e6998d-8af7-4b12-9c44-ca196938fc26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7421589178ad5d6367d24a663c106e00657e3a2318ff0c0215be18af958f2a90"}}, "hash": "c9842e4cf160208dfc78282b4969a9a4138b7b4da33e91681d9ec719ce749156", "text": "Second, we propose that if CMS has sent a nonrenewed or terminated contract the \u2018\u2018Notice of final settlement,\u2019\u2019 as described at proposed \u00a7 423.521(a), by the time CMS completes the reopening, described at proposed \u00a7 423.346(f), CMS will exclude that contract from that reopening. We established the proposed exclusion based on the timing of the issuance of the \u2018\u2018Notice of final settlement\u2019\u2019 and \ncompletion of the reopening, as opposed to the announcement of the reopening, due to the potentially lengthy reopening process and the likelihood that the \u2018\u2018Notice of final settlement\u2019\u2019 will be issued prior to CMS completing the \nreopening process. For example, under the current timeframe for the scheduled global reopening, CMS has typically announced in the Spring and completed the reopening in December of that year or January of the next. During that timeframe, nonrenewed or terminated contracts will likely go through the final settlement process, and as a result, will not be able to complete the reopening process. This is because, pursuant to proposed \u00a7 423.521(f), after the final settlement amount is calculated and the \u2018\u2018Notice of final settlement\u2019\u2019 is issued to the Part D sponsor, CMS will no longer apply retroactive payment adjustments, and there will be no adjustments applied to amounts used in the calculation of the final settlement amount. We propose to codify these inclusion criteria at \u00a7 423.346(g). \nWe also propose at \u00a7 423.346(g)(2) \nthat, specifically for targeted reopenings, CMS will identify which contracts or contract types are to be included in the reopening. This is because, as described above, targeted reopenings are targeted to the Part D contracts that are impacted by the particular issue that CMS needs to address. Therefore, in order to be included in a targeted reopening, the Part D contract must have been impacted by the issue that causes CMS to perform a reopening. To date, most targeted reopenings have been performed because of a CMS-identified issue that most sponsors were not aware of prior to CMS completing the targeted reopening. Meaning that, sponsors would not be aware of this specific inclusion criteria unless CMS informed the sponsors of the CMS-identified issue and the sponsors\u2019 contracts impacted. Therefore, we propose that CMS will notify sponsors of this specific inclusion criteria via the proposed reopening notification and/or the proposed reopening completion announcement, as described below. \n4. Reopening Notification and \nReopening Completion Announcement \nWe propose to add new paragraphs at \n\u00a7 423.346 to codify our existing policy regarding reopening notifications and \nreopening completion announcements. We propose to codify at \u00a7 423.346(e) that CMS will notify the sponsor(s) that will be included in the global or targeted reopening of its intention to perform a global or a targeted reopening\u2014that is, the sponsor would receive prior notice of the reopening\u2014 only when it is necessary for the sponsor(s) to submit PDE data and/or DIR data prior to the reopening.

For example, if CMS identifies an error in an internal CMS file that CMS used in the reconciliation or reopening, CMS may correct that file and reopen (holding all other data originally used constant), without the need for the sponsor(s) to submit PDE data or DIR data. See, for example, HPMS memorandum, \u2018\u2018Second reopening of the 2011 Final Part D Payment Reconciliation,\u2019\u2019 July 7, 2017 (available at https://www.cms.gov/ Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/ Computer-Data-and-Systems/HPMS/ HPMS-Memos-Archive-Annual-Items/ SysHPMS-Memo-Archive-%3F-2017- Qtr3). \nWe propose at paragraph (e)(1) that \nCMS will include in the notification the deadline for submitting PDE data and/ or DIR data to be included in the reopening. We also propose that the deadline to submit this data will be at least 90 calendar days after the date of the notice. Ninety days is consistent with our proposed PDE timeliness requirements at proposed \u00a7 423.325(b). \nIn addition, we propose at \n\u00a7 423.346(e)(2) that the reopening notification will include inclusion criteria in the form of a description of the contract(s) (either specifically by contract number or generally by contract-type or contract status) that will be included in the reopening. This will put a sponsor on notice of whether its contracts are included in the reopening. \nWe propose to codify at \u00a7 423.346(f) \nthat CMS will announce when it has completed a reopening, including in cases where CMS issued a notice under proposed paragraph (e). This announcement is consistent with existing policy and past practice. At paragraph (f)(1), we propose to specify that CMS will provide a description of the data used in the reopening. As in past reopenings, this data could include \nPDE data described by the processed date on the Prescription Drug Front-end System (PDFS) response report, DIR data described by the date received in the Health Plan Management System (HPMS), as well as any other relevant data used to perform the reopening. \nAt paragraph (f)(2), we propose to \ninclude in the notice a statement of the contract(s) (either specifically by contract number or generally by contract-type or contract status) that were included in the reopening, consistent with proposed \u00a7 423.346(e)(2). We propose to specify which contracts or contract types are included in both notices, that is, both the announcement of the completion of the reopening and the reopening notification because, as proposed above, CMS would not issue a reopening notification when it is not necessary for the sponsor(s) to submit PDE data and/ or DIR data prior to the reopening. \nAt paragraph (f)(3), we propose to \ninclude in the announcement of the completion of the reopening the date by which reports describing the reopening results will be available to the sponsor. In addition, at paragraph (f)(4), we propose to include the date by which a sponsor must submit an appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 423.350, if the sponsor disagrees with the reopening results. \n5. Definitions of \u2018\u2018Global Reopening\u2019\u2019 \nand \u2018\u2018Targeted Reopening\u2019\u2019 \nWe propose to adopt definitions of \nglobal reopening and targeted reopening at \u00a7 423.308. We propose that a global reopening is a reopening under \u00a7 423.346 in which CMS includes all Part D sponsor contracts that the meet the inclusion criteria described at proposed \u00a7 423.346(g). We propose that the definition of the targeted reopening is a reopening under \u00a7 423.346 in which CMS includes one or more (but not all) Part D sponsors contracts that the meet the inclusion criteria described at proposed \u00a7 423.346(g). Finally, consistent with these proposed definitions, we propose to add the terms \u2018\u2018global reopening\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018targeted reopening\u2019\u2019 to existing \u00a7 423.346(a). \nThe proposals described previously \nare consistent with our current guidance and requirements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f0058a5-2e1d-4dac-afd4-161188163329": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f0058a5-2e1d-4dac-afd4-161188163329", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caf112de-b480-4ee0-95e3-abcce8086309", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "57fb61445f8ad458472f6c2f049951649ff7e59bed234d4829fd1a52b6965761"}, "2": {"node_id": "e20ec420-46b3-4a5e-9307-fb5a8d2046b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a73ee201caa53cfcd19fd57e70cbcf70250cf8ff6b98095541ab3abf7ad0be94"}}, "hash": "b4b247c36a27519689986bf00ad07d38cd789b47d53276c06940bc98b849092a", "text": "The proposals described previously \nare consistent with our current guidance and requirements. Nothing in this proposal places additional requirements on Part D sponsors. As such, the proposed changes to \u00a7 423.308 and \u00a7 423.346 do not place any additional burden on the Part D sponsors or their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Our proposal will not change the extent to which Part D sponsors comply with the reopening process. Part D sponsors\u2019 compliance with this reopening process is evidenced by each Part D sponsor\u2019s signed attestation certifying the cost data (pursuant to \u00a7 423.505(k)(3) and (5)) that CMS uses in each of the reopenings. In addition, the burden associated with the submission of cost data is already approved under the OMB control numbers 0938\u20130982 (CMS\u2013 10174) and 0938\u20130964 (CMS\u201310141). Therefore, we do not believe that our proposal will result in additional burden and have not incorporated this provision in the COI section of this rule, nor are we are scoring this provision in the Regulatory Impact Analysis section because industry is already complying with this process. AA. Part D Proposed Automatic \nShipment Requirements (\u00a7 423.505) \n1. Background \nAn automatic shipment or automatic \ndelivery (collectively referred to \nhereinafter as \u2018\u2018auto-ship\u2019\u2019) service refers to the service whereby a pharmacy ships prescription refills to an individual\u2019s home when the refill is due without requiring the individual to make separate requests for each refill. Auto- ship service does not refer to the delivery of new prescription fills or prescription refills coordinated by long- term care (LTC) facilities for their residents. By \u2018\u2018prescription refills,\u2019\u2019 we mean all fills of a prescription for a medication after an individual has obtained an initial fill; including both refills with the same prescription number as well as prescription renewals for the same drug, dose, and instructions with new prescription numbers. Additionally, while often employed by traditional mail-order pharmacies, some retail pharmacies also offer auto-ship services. \nAuto-ship services provide an added \nconvenience for Part D enrollees and have the potential to improve adherence by preventing interruptions in therapy resulting from late refills. However, auto-ship services can also generate waste and additional costs for Part D enrollees and the Part D program when unneeded or unwanted refills are shipped. Once a drug leaves the pharmacy, it generally cannot be returned and reused. In an effort to address concerns with the potential waste, we provided guidance in the Final CY 2014 Call Letter instructing Part D sponsors to require their network pharmacies to obtain enrollee consent prior to shipping each new prescription or prescription refill (See page 144, published on April 1, 2013, and available at https://www.cms.gov/ \nMedicare/Health-Plans/ MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Announcement2014.pdf). In effect, we were instructing Part D sponsors to prohibit their network pharmacies from providing auto-ship services because we were still requiring the individual to make separate requests for each refill. \nSince the Final CY 2014 Call Letter, \nhowever, we have provided clarifications to the initial guidance, via Health Plan Management System (HPMS) memoranda and more recent Call Letters, that have gradually allowed for additional auto-ship services. For example, the subsequent guidance provided exceptions for employer-group waiver plans (EGWPs) and for new prescriptions received directly from the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00147 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4c80a63-192f-4375-85d5-f092fa5dba9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4c80a63-192f-4375-85d5-f092fa5dba9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50ce938b-61f5-447b-ba4d-a0830d018ad3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "57925a781cd3b412d62032822e6aba9fd6fe1d566d4d977991e0feb10222aeca"}, "3": {"node_id": "11060fb4-ef85-410c-8a46-74cf62a47249", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2efb4da53fb353b858c018caa12aa5e6f03177831c5b54fd005a5a7d0de7460c"}}, "hash": "27fc003ad3b3f1c3d361b83f55c5b55a55c86474ce579714e4626d00ec9e8627", "text": "79598 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nprescriber for Part D enrollees with \nexperience using auto-ship services. We applied these exceptions to pharmacies meeting certain conditions intended to balance the benefits of auto-ship services against the potential for waste and associated increased costs, such as providing that auto-ship services are for Part D enrollees that opt-in, and providing for refunds for any unwanted shipments. Most recently, we solicited feedback on proposed modifications to auto-ship services guidance as a part of the Draft CY 2020 Call Letter (See page 199 of Part 2, published on January 30, 2019, and available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Advance2020Part2.pdf). The proposed modifications included expectations that pharmacies would obtain annual consent from enrollees to participate in an auto-ship program, only offer an auto-ship option for refills of drugs that a Part D enrollee has been on for at least four consecutive months, send at least two reminders in advance of each shipment, and provide a full refund for any refills auto-shipped that a Part D enrollee reported as unneeded or otherwise unwanted. After receiving overwhelmingly positive comments, we announced in the Final CY 2020 Call Letter (See page 230, published on April 1, 2019, and available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/ Downloads/Announcement2020.pdf) that, beginning in CY 2020, interested Part D sponsors could permit network pharmacies to offer opt-in, voluntary, auto-ship for refills of established therapies to further promote consistent access to medications, support medication adherence, and offer Part D enrollees additional choices in obtaining their covered Part D drugs. The final policy did not include the expectation that pharmacies obtain annual consent, or to auto-ship only to those enrollees that had been on the drug for at least four consecutive months. The guidance applied to auto- ship services for traditional multi- month mail-order supplies as well as auto-ship services for shorter day supplies from pharmacies utilizing innovative dispensing models and specialized packaging. \nWe have not received concerns or \ncomplaints from Part D enrollees or Part D sponsors since we issued our current guidance in the Final CY 2020 Call Letter. We are now proposing to codify these policies for auto-ship services. \nSection 1860D\u201312(b)(3) of the Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395w\u2013112(b)(3)) authorizes the \nSecretary to include contract terms for Part D sponsors that are consistent with Part C as found under sections 1857(a) \nand 1857(d) of the Act. We are committed to ensuring consistent and reliable access to Part D drugs for Part D enrollees, and propose to codify in regulation auto-ship policies with appropriate safeguards to prevent or limit unwanted or unnecessary auto- shipped prescriptions. Specifically, we propose to add a new paragraph at \u00a7 423.505(b)(28) to require Part D sponsors to require their network pharmacies that offer auto-ship services to\u2014 \n\u2022Provide automatic shipments only \nto Part D enrollees that opt-in, on a drug-by-drug basis, after an initial fill; \n\u2022Provide shipping reminders prior to \neach shipment; \n\u2022Refund any cost sharing paid by the \nPart D enrollee and reverse the claim when the enrollee reports the shipment is not needed or wanted; and \n\u2022Discontinue auto-ship services \nwhen a Part D enrollee requests to opt- out or when notified that a Part D enrollee has entered a skilled nursing facility or elected hospice coverage. \n2. Voluntary Participation \nWe propose to add new paragraph \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(i) to require Part D \nsponsors to require their network pharmacies that provide auto-ship services to provide automatic shipments only to Part D enrollees that opt-in to \nauto-ship services, on a drug-by-drug basis, after an initial fill. Drug-by-drug means that network pharmacies would be required to document that a Part D enrollee has opted to receive auto-ship services for each specific drug. A blanket opt-in option applying across multiple drugs would not satisfy this requirement. We propose the qualifier \u2018\u2018after an initial fill,\u2019\u2019 because network pharmacies should not assume the Part D enrollee would consent to auto-ship services for a specific drug at the same time as an initial fill.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11060fb4-ef85-410c-8a46-74cf62a47249": {"__data__": {"id_": "11060fb4-ef85-410c-8a46-74cf62a47249", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50ce938b-61f5-447b-ba4d-a0830d018ad3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "57925a781cd3b412d62032822e6aba9fd6fe1d566d4d977991e0feb10222aeca"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4c80a63-192f-4375-85d5-f092fa5dba9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "27fc003ad3b3f1c3d361b83f55c5b55a55c86474ce579714e4626d00ec9e8627"}}, "hash": "2efb4da53fb353b858c018caa12aa5e6f03177831c5b54fd005a5a7d0de7460c", "text": "A period of time is needed for the Part D enrollee to initiate therapy, and establish with their prescriber whether treatment with the new drug is tolerated and to be continued. Once a Part D enrollee voluntarily selects auto-ship services for a specific drug after an initial fill, a network pharmacy could consider this Part D enrollee to have chosen to have auto-shipped all prescription refills authorized for that drug. In addition, if a provider renews a prescription for a drug for which an enrollee previously selected auto-ship services, we propose that the network pharmacy may extend the Part D enrollee\u2019s previous consent for auto-ship services to the new prescription and its authorized refills, unless instructed otherwise by the Part D enrollee, their provider, or an \nauthorized representative. In turn, auto- ship services may be cancelled by a Part D enrollee, their provider, or an authorized representative. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \n3. Enrollee Notification \nWe propose to add new paragraph \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(ii)(A)) to require Part D \nsponsors to require their network pharmacies to provide a minimum of \ntwo (2) shipping reminders to the Part D enrollee prior to shipment through auto-ship services. Such reminders would need to be received prior to shipment so that a Part D enrollee can modify or cancel an order, if needed. Part D sponsors may specify an approximate shipping date range (for example, 2\u20133 calendar days) in lieu of an exact date in shipping reminders. \nWe also propose to add new \nparagraph \u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(ii)(B) to specify that network pharmacies must provide the shipping reminders by hard copy mailing, telephone, electronic delivery, or other comparable means of communication such as a fax machine. The method of delivery should be based on the Part D enrollee\u2019s stated preference when feasible. A missed call with no message left, bounce-back email messages, or returned direct mailings would not count as successful shipping reminders because they indicate that the enrollee never received the reminder. \nAdditionally, we propose to add for \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(ii)(C) the requirement that all types of reminders must, at a minimum, include the name of the Part D drug, any applicable cost sharing, the scheduled shipping date, instructions on how to cancel the pending automatic shipment, and instructions on how to opt-out of any future automatic shipments. In turn the pharmacy would be required to honor the request to cancel the specified drugs from further auto shipment. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \n4. Refund Policy \nWe propose to add new paragraph \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(iii) to require Part D \nsponsors to require their network pharmacies that provide auto-ship services to refund any cost sharing paid by the Part D enrollee for any shipped prescriptions that such Part D enrollee reports as unneeded or otherwise unwanted, regardless of whether the drug is returned to the pharmacy, and reverse the claim. Part D sponsors would be required to delete the associated Prescription Drug Event (PDE) for these reversed claims.

Unlike a retail pharmacy setting where a Part D enrollee can review a medication, including its use and cost, prior to purchasing, auto-ship services remove the opportunity for the Part D enrollee (or their authorized representative) to provide a final in-person check and confirmation of understanding prior to purchase. In addition, should a Part D enrollee report a drug enrolled in auto- ship services as unneeded or unwanted, this presents an opportunity for discussion between the network pharmacy and the Part D enrollee on continuing auto-ship services for the drug in question, or any other drugs enrolled in auto-ship services for the Part D enrollee. Given the proposed reminder requirements discussed in section IV.AA.3 of this proposed rule, combined with the fact that we have received no complaints since our current guidance on auto-ship services has been in effect, we believe network pharmacies are well positioned to evaluate the appropriateness and safety of auto-ship services in collaboration with Part D enrollees. Moreover, we believe the lack of complaints received are also an indication that the potential for abuse of such a refund policy is low. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \n5. Discontinuation \nWe propose to add new paragraph \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(iv) to require Part D \nsponsors to require their network pharmacies that offer auto-ship services to discontinue auto-ship services if A) the enrollee requests to opt-out of automatic shipments or B) the network pharmacy receives notification that a Part D enrollee entered a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or elected hospice. Notification that an enrollee has entered a SNF or elected hospice coverage may come via the Part D enrollee, the Part D enrollee\u2019s provider, the Part D enrollee\u2019s authorized representative, or the Part D sponsor. A Part D sponsor could receive \nsuch information via a data system, such as daily Transaction Record Reports (TRR) or the MARx system. Section 1860D\u20132(e)(2)(B) of the Act states that a drug prescribed to a Part D eligible individual cannot be considered a covered Part D drug if payment for such drug is available (or would be available but for the application of a deductible) under Part A or B for that individual as prescribed and dispensed or administered, such as during an inpatient hospital stay or home health episode. Thus, it is imperative that a network pharmacy discontinue auto- ship services for any drug that should be covered under Parts A or B due to a change in the Part D enrollee\u2019s status that has drug coverage implications. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \n6. Summary of Proposals \nIn summary, consistent with our \nlongstanding subregulatory guidance, \nwe are proposing to codify in regulation at new paragraph \u00a7 423.505(b)(28) the following requirements for auto-ship services that Part D sponsors would be required to include in their network pharmacy contracts: \n\u2022The proposed \u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(i) \nwould require that participation is voluntary; \n\u2022The proposed \n\u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(ii)(A) would require a minimum of two (2) shipping reminders prior to shipment, and \u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(ii)(B) would require that all types of reminders include all relevant information, such as the name of the Part D drug, any applicable cost sharing, the scheduled shipping date, instructions on how to cancel the pending automatic shipment ; and instructions on how to opt-out of any future automatic shipments; \n\u2022The proposed \u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(iii) \nwould require a refund policy; and \n\u2022The proposed \u00a7 423.505(b)(28)(iv) \nwould require discontinuation of auto- ship services if the network pharmacy receives a request from the enrollee, enrollee\u2019s prescriber, or authorized representative to opt-out of automatic shipments or notification that the Part D enrollee entered a skilled nursing facility or elected hospice coverage. \nAdditionally, as discussed in the \npreamble to this section, we have been monitoring compliance to this policy by monitoring complaints from both Part D sponsors and Part D enrollees.

Part D Subcontractors May \nTerminate Only at the End of a Month (\u00a7 423.505) \nAt \u00a7 423.505(i), we propose to require \nPart D sponsors to include a provision in certain contracts with first tier, downstream, and related entities (FDRs) (as defined at \u00a7 423.501) that the FDR may terminate its contract only at the end of a calendar month after providing at least 60 days\u2019 prior notice. Specifically, we propose that this prior notice be required in contracts with \nFDRs that perform critical functions on the sponsor\u2019s behalf, as discussed below. We believe this change is necessary to protect beneficiaries from disruptions in receiving Part D benefits and to protect the Part D program from incurring additional financial liability. \nPart D sponsors contract with FDRs to \nperform many of the services critical to the operation of the Part D program. For example, FDRs administer formularies, process beneficiary enrollments into plans, contract with pharmacies, process Part D claims at the point of sale, and administer enrollee appeals and grievance processes. Many Part D sponsors do not have the internal capability to take over administration of these functions from their FDRs on short notice. If an FDR ceases operations under a contract, enrollees in an affected plan may therefore be left without access to their Part D benefits until the sponsor is able to make alternative arrangements. \nFor these reasons, CMS has a critical \ninterest in ensuring Part D sponsors\u2019 contracts with these FDRs protect beneficiaries and the program. We have codified a variety of requirements for sponsors\u2019 relationships with FDRs at \u00a7 423.505(i). For instance, we require that contracts protect enrollees from liability for fees that are the responsibility of the Part D sponsor (\u00a7 423.505(i)(3)(i)) and that the FDR must provide services in a manner that is consistent with the Part D sponsor\u2019s contractual obligations (\u00a7 423.505(i)(3)(iii)). These requirements promote consistent and competent administration of the Part D program. \nOccasionally, Part D sponsors face \nfinancial difficulties so severe that they may stop paying FDRs for services provided under their Part D contracts. Such difficulties may also cause sponsors to be placed into receivership or bankruptcy. In response to such developments, an FDR may terminate its contract with the Part D sponsor or, in the case of FDRs that administer claims at point of sale, stop paying claims to prevent or minimize operating losses. Such actions may be prompted by overdue reimbursement from the sponsor or anticipated payment stoppages and can occur in the middle of a month, depending on the \ntermination notice terms in the sponsor\u2019s contract with the FDR. Fortunately, such mid-month terminations are rare. However, when they occur, they can result in significant disruptions for enrollees, including a lack of access to needed prescriptions through their Part D plan. For instance, a PDP contract terminated in the middle \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00149 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b105559-f530-4815-9c0d-56e52da62267": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b105559-f530-4815-9c0d-56e52da62267", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2300bafa-6688-4a47-8fe3-080ba6cc05a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "de6187f56d34a23b4adef201c522fa0280182ac9cd37a27771776445010f5c08"}, "3": {"node_id": "43cb3965-811b-4a3d-a20a-d5fc568682cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "40a020795ec03dff313678073f0ca91373705238f434b6b93b8d6e534db13231"}}, "hash": "99c8ccfcdcb344762cf55671fa8eb914a517572d4a84df061d8b62f4ee7aafe5", "text": "79600 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nof March 2021 due, in part, to their PBM \nterminating its contract mid-month for nonpayment. This disrupted care for almost 40,000 beneficiaries and forced CMS to incur additional expense to ensure that all beneficiaries had continuous coverage for the month of March. \nMid-month terminations can also \nresult in CMS incurring additional costs. CMS makes prospective monthly capitation payments to Part D sponsors, as provided in section 1860D\u201315(a)(1) of the Act and codified in \u00a7 423.315(b). When an FDR performing critical functions on a sponsor\u2019s behalf terminates a contract mid-month, CMS has already paid the sponsor for the services that the FDR was supposed to render for the remainder of that month. To protect beneficiaries from suffering further harm, CMS may find it necessary to terminate a sponsor\u2019s contract pursuant to \u00a7 423.509 or come to terms for a mutual termination pursuant to \u00a7 423.508. CMS reassigns affected beneficiaries to other Part D plans in the same service area when such terminations occur at any time other than the end of a contract year. When these reassignments occur mid-month, CMS makes a full prospective payment for that month to the plan into which enrollees are reassigned, so that CMS pays twice for the same month. For example, if contract 1 terminates effective May 15 and CMS reassigns enrollees to contract 2, CMS would pay contract 2 for the full month of May even though it already paid contract 1 for the month of May. CMS has authority under \u00a7 423.509(b)(2)(ii) to recover the prorated share of the capitation payments made to the Part D sponsors covering the period of the month following the contract termination, but as a practical matter, a contract terminated due to financial difficulties usually does not have the funds available to repay CMS. Nor is CMS able to make a prorated monthly payment to the contract into which enrollees are reassigned. \nTo protect beneficiaries and the Part \nD program from the consequences of mid-month terminations of certain FDR contracts, we propose to establish at \u00a7 423.505(i)(6) a requirement that all Part D sponsors\u2019 contracts with FDRs that perform certain key Part D functions require a minimum of 60- days\u2019 prior notice of termination with an effective date that coincides with the end of a calendar month. We are adopting this change pursuant to our authority at section 1857(e) of the Act, made applicable to Part D through \nsection 1860D\u201312(b)(3)(D), which authorizes the Secretary to adopt contract terms and conditions as \nnecessary and appropriate and not inconsistent with the Part D statute. This proposed policy is consistent with the existing requirement that FDRs must \ncomply with Part D requirements and support the sponsor\u2019s performance of its Part D functions, including ensuring access to covered Part D drugs under \u00a7 423.120(a), as required at \u00a7 423.505(i)(3)(iii) and (iv). Since Part D sponsors are paid prospectively and in units of no less than one calendar month, their subcontractors should be able to negotiate arrangements with their sponsors to access to covered Part D drugs in no less than 1-month increments by, for example, requiring sponsors to provide a surety bond to compensate the FDR in the event of the sponsors\u2019 fiscal insolvency. We do not believe that this will result in significant additional expense for sponsors because mid-month terminations have been very rare to date. \nThe proposed provision at new \nparagraph (6) will require the contract between a Part D sponsor and an FDR providing certain functions to state that a contract termination could only occur after a 60-day notice period and have an effective date that coincides with the end of a calendar month. The functions for which this requirement would apply would be: \n\u2022Authorization, adjudication, and \nprocessing of prescription drug claims at the point of sale; \n\u2022Administration and tracking of \nenrollees\u2019 drug benefits in real time; \n\u2022Operation of an enrollee appeals \nand grievance process; and \n\u2022Contracting with or selection of \nprescription drug providers (including pharmacies and non-pharmacy providers) for inclusion in the Part D sponsor\u2019s network. \nAll of these functions are critical to \nbeneficiaries maintaining access to Part D drugs and ensuring that they pay appropriate out of pocket costs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43cb3965-811b-4a3d-a20a-d5fc568682cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "43cb3965-811b-4a3d-a20a-d5fc568682cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2300bafa-6688-4a47-8fe3-080ba6cc05a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "de6187f56d34a23b4adef201c522fa0280182ac9cd37a27771776445010f5c08"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b105559-f530-4815-9c0d-56e52da62267", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "99c8ccfcdcb344762cf55671fa8eb914a517572d4a84df061d8b62f4ee7aafe5"}}, "hash": "40a020795ec03dff313678073f0ca91373705238f434b6b93b8d6e534db13231", "text": "The disruption of any one of these functions could result in beneficiaries not receiving necessary drugs or incurring unnecessary costs. \nWe solicit comments on this proposal. \nAC. Application of 2-Year Ban on Reentering the Part D Program Following Non-Renewal (\u00a7\u00a7 423.507 and 423.508) \nWe are proposing to amend \n\u00a7\u00a7 423.507(a)(3) and 423.508(e) to clarify that the prohibition on PDP sponsors that non-renew or mutually terminate a contract receiving a new PDP contract for 2 years applies at the PDP region level. That is, if a sponsor non-renews or mutually terminates a PDP contract, the two-year exclusion \nwould only prohibit them from receiving a new or expanded PDP contract in the PDP region(s) they exited and would not prevent them from receiving a new or expanded contract in another region(s). We are also proposing to clarify that that the 2-year exclusion applies whenever a PDP sponsor terminates all of its benefit packages (PBPs) in a PDP region, commonly known as a \u2018\u2018service area reduction,\u2019\u2019 even if they continue to serve other PDP regions under the contract. \nUnder current regulations at \n\u00a7\u00a7 423.507(a)(3) and 423.508(e), Part D sponsors that non-renew or mutually terminate their contracts with CMS are ineligible to enter into a new Part D contract for two years following the non-renewal, absent circumstances that warrant special consideration. CMS adopted the two-year exclusion at the beginning of the Part D program in 2006 in order to implement the requirements of section 1857(c)(4) of the Act, made applicable to the Part D program by section 1860D\u201312(b)(3)(B) of the Act. The 2-year exclusion following contract non-renewal promotes stability in the Part D program, as the additional period of contracting ineligibility causes organizations to consider more than just the year-to-year fluctuations in the Part D market in deciding whether to discontinue their participation in the program. \nGiven the significance of plan \navailability on a per region basis under the Part D statute, it makes sense to treat each PDP multiregion contract as, in effect, a set of distinct contracts, one for each PDP region, when CMS is taking action to protect market stability. For example, pursuant to \u00a7 423.859(a), CMS is required to make available to each beneficiary the choice of at least two Part D plans that serve the area in which they reside. At least one of those plans must be a PDP. Also, each PBP may only serve one PDP region. PDP sponsors submit separate bids for each PDP region. CMS uses those region-specific bids to determine the regional premium benchmarks and identify PBPs into which LIS beneficiaries will be automatically enrolled. As such, a PDP sponsor exiting or reentering one region has little or no effect on the market for \nPDP products in any other region. \nApplying the 2-year exclusion at the \nPDP region level would sufficiently promote the market-stabilizing purpose of the exclusion by prohibiting PDP sponsors from non-renewing all their plans in a region and returning to the same market after only one year of absence from the program. We believe the 2-year exclusion as applied at the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00150 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3346dc2c-ca3c-4b54-a90b-ba321262c92e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3346dc2c-ca3c-4b54-a90b-ba321262c92e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "becbc68f-fa31-4da9-aeac-8c2ef33c8bf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "053c4701bfaaeb23340dac371263a1d47f2a681d92847851d9288acff904c0c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "c70a30e9-ea12-4451-98d3-8e840a427124", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "34bd02d6a6940f66a2530b5b4e833b387b7e0e773468525a447783263e9b6a65"}}, "hash": "ec97de7c5c3b5710d3c92218b304f515d9d11ad1e3b41783000e4b5f98411d3a", "text": "79601 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nregional level would prevent sponsors \nfrom undermining the nondiscrimination requirements at section 1860D\u201311(e)(2)(D)(i) of the Act by, for example, terminating PBPs in a region so they would no longer receive LIS auto-enrollment. If the two-year exclusion were not applied at the regional level, the effective penalty for tying Part D sponsors\u2019 participation in Part D solely to serve one segment of beneficiaries (that is, LIS eligible) would be only year\u2019s absence from offering plans in that region, rather than two. However, these same concerns do not apply across regions. A sponsor that non-renews a plan receiving LIS auto- enrollments in one region that wishes to enter a different region the next year would not simply be seeking to enroll more desirable beneficiaries who had declined to enroll in their previous plan; instead, they would be competing in a completely different market. Therefore, we see no reason to prohibit \nsponsors that non-renew their plans in one region from offering plans in a new region before the 2-year exclusion period elapses. \nWe believe the effective \nadministration of the Part D program is best served by promoting stability at the PDP region level and preventing sponsors exiting and re-entering regions each year, which may cause disruption to the regional PDP offerings. We do not believe that we need to prohibit sponsors from entering new regions for two years after they have opted to exit other regions in order to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we propose to modify \u00a7\u00a7 423.507(a) and 423.508(e). \nWe propose to modify \u00a7 423.507(a)(3) \nas follows: \n\u2022Revising paragraph (3) to add \nregulatory text clarifying that the requirements in this paragraph pertain to PDP sponsors\u2019 ineligibility to enter into a contract for two years; \n\u2022Redesignating paragraph (a)(3) \nregarding the current regulatory requirement regarding a 2-year contracting ban following non-renewal of a PDP contract as new paragraph (a)(3)(i); \n\u2022Adding language to new paragraph \n(a)(3)(i) stating that CMS cannot enter into a new contract in the PDP region or regions served by the non-renewing contract; \n\u2022Adding new paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to \nauthorize CMS to make organizations that non-renew all of their PBPs in a PDP region ineligible to have plan bids approved again in that region for 2 years; and \n\u2022Adding new paragraph (a)(3)(iii) \nexempting new EGWP PBPs from the two year ban. Similarly, we propose to apply our \npolicy limiting the offering of plans at the PDP region level for 2 years to mutual terminations under \u00a7 423.508. We propose to add a sentence to the existing regulatory text at paragraph (e) stating that a mutual termination of participation in a PDP region makes a PDP sponsor ineligible to apply for qualification to offer new plans in that region for 2 years. While we already require sponsors seeking a mutual termination to agree not to apply for a new contract for two years, we believe that the same concerns that support applying the 2-year exclusion for non- renewals at the regional level pertain to mutual terminations. Allowing a sponsor that mutually terminates a contract in one PDP region to apply for a new contract in another PDP region does not incentivize the market- destabilizing practice of entering and exiting the PDP market in rapid succession. Therefore, we believe our application of the 2-year exclusion should be consistent between non- renewals and mutual terminations. \nWe note that this proposed provision \nwould not apply to a PDP sponsor\u2019s non-renewal of its EGWP plans since those plans do not affect the availability of plan choices to beneficiaries or the number of plans that qualify for automatic LIS enrollments. We are also not concerned that non-renewal of EGWP plans would be driven by a sponsor\u2019s attempt to engage in adverse selection because EGWP plans are subject to contract negotiation between employers and sponsors and are not open to enrollment to all beneficiaries in the service area. \nWe solicit comments on these \nproposals. \nAD.

We developed the guidance to prevent beneficiary disruptions when a PDP sponsor discontinues PBPs and to allow the consolidation of PDP contracts of subsidiaries of the same parent organization. We also developed guidance related to continuation of enrollment in renewing PDP PBPs in order to facilitate \u2018\u2018evergreen\u2019\u2019 enrollments, as required by sections 1851(c)(3)(B) and 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, by not requiring additional enrollment transactions when a PBP renews in a new plan year. \nConsistent with the requirement in \nsections 1851(c)(3)(B) and 1860D\u2013 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00151 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfe33a2c-82a1-4992-a5ae-70445806e4de": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfe33a2c-82a1-4992-a5ae-70445806e4de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e9a022e-310e-473b-b8de-b65a240784f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2539cc3afbc550a8bf7997cd1f8497afb742169f116f96c9b603e3eace4ab0f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c21ce93-0f07-4fe0-a16b-ac0353c39c80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "984dac3e58e613b409dab43c7d64f15abb5cc28f0e32543bfe2b5f6ffa4787bc"}}, "hash": "9956f7dd5408045acd6c85e8d8d55e4363004a99f818512ad12f1ddc12b1af4a", "text": "79602 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n1(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act that an \nindividual who has elected a plan is considered to make the same election until the individual changes an election or the plan is discontinued in the area in which the individual resides, enrollees remain in a renewing PBP for the following year if they do not make another election (or opt to discontinue Part D coverage). CMS requires the PBP\u2019s plan ID number to remain the same, and beneficiaries remain enrolled in the PBP unless they make another election. \nIf a Part D sponsor discontinues a PBP \nbut continues to offer individual market coverage under the same PDP contract, CMS currently \u2018\u2018crosswalks\u2019\u2019 enrollment from the non-renewing PBP into another active PBP under the same contract. This means that beneficiaries enrolled in the non-renewing PBP during the current plan year will be enrolled in another surviving PBP offered under the same contract the following year unless the beneficiary selects alternative coverage during the Annual Election Period (AEP). These plan crosswalks are referred to as \u2018\u2018consolidated renewal\u2019\u2019 crosswalks. We use consolidated renewal crosswalks primarily to prevent beneficiaries from losing Part D coverage, as past experience indicates that about 20 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Part D plans that non-renew without a subsequent plan crosswalk fail to select new coverage. In those cases, the beneficiaries not only lose Part D coverage, but also are subject to the Part D late enrollment penalty. We also use plan crosswalks in these situations in order to prevent plans from \u2018\u2018dumping\u2019\u2019 beneficiaries who are high cost or whom the organization otherwise no longer wishes to cover. \nConsolidated renewal crosswalks \noccur only with respect to non-renewing PBPs offering enhanced alternative coverage, as defined at \u00a7 423.100. Consistent with \u00a7 423.104(f)(2), we do not permit organizations to non-renew a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage, as defined at \u00a7 423.100, unless they are non-renewing all individual market PBPs in a PDP region because a basic prescription drug plan offering is a requirement in order for a sponsor to offer enhanced alternative coverage within the same service area. In consolidated renewal crosswalks, sponsors may transfer affected enrollees into a PBP offering either enhanced alternative or basic prescription drug coverage. The enrollment of a non- renewing PBP is not \u2018\u2018split\u2019\u2019 among multiple PBPs\u2014that is, all beneficiaries enrolled in a non-renewing PBP are \ncrosswalked to the same PBP in the following year. If a Part D sponsor or multiple Part D \nsponsors under a single parent \norganization (as defined in \u00a7 423.4) operate multiple PDP contracts that they wish to consolidate in the following contract year, we permit plan crosswalks between the PBPs of the non-renewing contract(s) and the PBPs in the surviving contract. These plan crosswalks are referred to as \u2018\u2018contract consolidation\u2019\u2019 crosswalks. We do not permit plan crosswalks between PBPs under different PDP contracts held by subsidiaries of different parent organizations. We currently encourage contract consolidations when multiple subsidiaries of a parent organization offer individual market PDP coverage in the same region(s) in order to promote meaningful choices and competition in the PDP market. We are proposing in section III.V. of this proposed rule to limit the number of PDP contracts a parent organization may offer through its subsidiaries to one per PDP region, but we do not think this proposal will cause significantly more contract consolidations because, historically, few parent organizations have declined to consolidate contracts in this situation. \nAll the enrollment in a non-renewing \ncontract subject to contract consolidation is crosswalked into the surviving contract. The surviving PDP contract must offer individual market plans in all the PDP region(s) covered by the non-renewing contract(s). As with consolidated renewal crosswalks, enrollment from a non-renewing PBP is not \u2018\u2018split\u2019\u2019 into multiple PBPs and all enrollees from non-renewing enhanced alternative PBPs are transferred into another PBP offering either enhanced alternative or basic coverage. \nUnlike with consolidated renewal \ncrosswalks, contract consolidation crosswalks can involve the non-renewal of PBPs offering basic coverage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c21ce93-0f07-4fe0-a16b-ac0353c39c80": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c21ce93-0f07-4fe0-a16b-ac0353c39c80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e9a022e-310e-473b-b8de-b65a240784f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2539cc3afbc550a8bf7997cd1f8497afb742169f116f96c9b603e3eace4ab0f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfe33a2c-82a1-4992-a5ae-70445806e4de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9956f7dd5408045acd6c85e8d8d55e4363004a99f818512ad12f1ddc12b1af4a"}}, "hash": "984dac3e58e613b409dab43c7d64f15abb5cc28f0e32543bfe2b5f6ffa4787bc", "text": "For contract consolidation crosswalks, enrollees in non-renewing PBPs offering basic coverage are crosswalked into the PBP in the surviving contract that offers basic coverage. We do not permit contract consolidation crosswalks from PBPs offering basic coverage to PBPs offering enhanced alternative coverage, in order to protect beneficiaries receiving low income subsidies (\u2018\u2018LIS\u2019\u2019) from unexpected cost increases. A portion of the premium for an enhanced alternative PBP is supplemental premium. Under \u00a7 423.780(b)(1)(i), the LIS can only be used for the portion of the monthly beneficiary premium attributable to basic coverage. This does not include the amount attributed to supplemental coverage for enhanced \nalternative plans. Any LIS-eligible individuals enrolled in a non-renewing PBP offering basic prescription drug \ncoverage that were transferred into a PBP offering enhanced alternative coverage, and who did not change their election, might therefore have to pay more than they would for a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage even if the enhanced alternative PBP had a lower overall premium. \n3. Proposed General Rules for Plan \nCrosswalks (\u00a7 423.530(a)) \nSection 1860D\u20131(b)(1)(B) of the Act \nrequires the Secretary to use rules similar to and coordinated with the rules for enrollment, disenrollment, termination, and change of enrollment in MA\u2013PD plans under certain provisions of section 1851 of the Act. Therefore, in proposing to codify general rules for plan crosswalks, we seek both to maintain current policy and, to the extent possible, be consistent with the requirements for MA plan crosswalks codified at \u00a7 422.530 in the final rule published in the January 19, 2021 Federal Register (CMS\u20134192\u2013F2) \n(86 FR 5864). \nAt \u00a7 423.530(a)(1), we propose to \ndefine a plan crosswalk as the movement of enrollees from one PDP PBP to another PDP PBP. This definition is consistent with current policy and with the definition of crosswalks for MA plans, codified at \u00a7 422.530(a)(1). \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.530(a)(2)(i) \nthrough (iii) to adopt the crosswalk prohibitions in current CMS subregulatory guidance, described in the PDP Renewal and Nonrenewal Guidance. First, we propose to prohibit crosswalks between PBPs in different \nPDP contracts unless the PDP contracts are held by the same Part D sponsor or by sponsors that are subsidiaries of the same parent organization. Second, we propose to prohibit crosswalks that split enrollment of one PBP into multiple PBPs. Third, we propose to prohibit crosswalks from PBPs offering basic coverage to PBPs offering enhanced alternative coverage. \nIn the past, organizations have sought \nexceptions to the prohibition of basic-to- enhanced alternative crosswalks on the grounds that one of the available enhanced alternative PBPs is lower cost or otherwise a better alternative for enrollees in a non-renewing basic PBP than the available basic PBP. These requests come in the context of proposed contract consolidations crosswalks and, because CMS prohibits PDP contracts from offering more than one PBP offering basic coverage in a region under \u00a7 423.265(b)(2), there would only be one option for the enrollees in non-renewing basic PBP to be transferred into.

Enhanced alternative PBPs sometimes offer lower premiums than basic PBPs under the same contract. However, as discussed previously in section IV.AD.2. of this proposed rule, a portion of the premium for an enhanced alternative PBP is the \u2018\u2018supplemental\u2019\u2019 premium and any LIS- eligible individuals transferred from a basic to an enhance PBP might therefore have to pay more than they would in the available basic PBP, even if the enhanced alternative PBP has lower overall premium. Therefore, we propose to continue our current policy in order to protect LIS-eligible beneficiaries from unanticipated premium increases. \nWe solicit comments on whether and \nunder what circumstances to allow crosswalks from PBPs offering basic prescription drug coverage to enhanced alternative coverage. For instance, should CMS allow plan crosswalks under these circumstances if the premiums and/or estimated total beneficiary cost of the plan offering enhanced alternative coverage would be substantially lower than for the plan offering basic coverage. CMS is interested in how and to what extent permitting such crosswalks would affect the market for basic prescription drug coverage. CMS is particularly interested in how such crosswalks could be administered in a way that protects LIS- eligible beneficiaries from premium and other cost increases. \nPlan crosswalks often occur in the \ncontext of contract renewals and non- renewals. We propose at \u00a7 423.530(a)(3) to require sponsors seeking crosswalks to comply with rules in \u00a7\u00a7 423.507 and 423.508 governing non-renewals and contract terminations, respectively. This requirement is consistent with the requirement for MA plan crosswalks codified at \u00a7 422.530(a)(3). \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.530(a)(4) to make \nclear that only enrollees eligible for enrollment under \u00a7 423.30 can be crosswalked from one PBP to another. Individuals who are not eligible for Part D enrollment cannot be enrolled in a Part D plan, so CMS cannot allow crosswalks of non-eligible individuals into new Part D plans. \nFinally, we propose at \u00a7 423.530(a)(5) \nto continue to allow enrollees in employer group health or waiver PBPs to be transferred between PBPs in accordance with the usual process for enrollment in employer group health or waiver plans, rather than in accordance with the proposed provisions of \u00a7 423.530. This proposal ensures that the process for enrollment in employer group health or waiver plans is not disrupted by this proposed rule. \nWe solicit comments on these \nproposals. \n4. Mandatory Crosswalks (\u00a7 423.530(b)) \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.530(b)(1) and (2) \nto require enrollees in PDP PBPs that are \nrenewing to be transferred into the same PBP for the following contract year. This is consistent with the current process summarized for renewal plans in the PDP Renewal and Nonrenewal Guidance. This requirement would continue to apply to PBPs offering both enhanced alternative and basic coverage. The proposed requirement continues to facilitate evergreen enrollment as required by section 1851(c)(3)(B) of the Act. The proposal is also consistent with the requirements for MA renewal crosswalks codified at \u00a7 422.530(b)(1)(i). \nWe solicit comment on this proposal. \n5. Plan Crosswalk Exceptions (\u00a7 423.530(c)) \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.530(c) to classify \nconsolidated renewal and contract consolidation crosswalks as \u2018\u2018crosswalk exceptions.\u2019\u2019 We propose to define \u2018\u2018consolidated renewals\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018contract consolidations\u2019\u2019 consistent with the current policy described previously in section IV.AD.2. of this proposed rule. We propose to codify our current policy for the two types of plan crosswalk exceptions with some modifications. \nFor consolidated renewals, we \npropose to codify current policy at \u00a7 423.530(c)(1) with four major modifications that balance concerns for beneficiaries in non-renewing plans losing coverage with concerns about market stability and limiting unexpected premium increases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec716a43-daba-41f9-9a5a-75c70234c77d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec716a43-daba-41f9-9a5a-75c70234c77d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "815e10cb-9e1e-4a1f-9628-eb48227ea9e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dc9655fee5f487e3869b6c88bcc71260d454561c0d0e334c05b2e0fd34d1145d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9f455ac-062a-4061-abcb-414b5240a58f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "044de64ca720f8df27702fc3806794f70d1246c4e271deb9d2c5dc82f33dd7fd"}}, "hash": "d3afda1f198d4ca74de1cc9350cafdede9a216d47d74fd2e3bda7cb141f1845c", "text": "As we state in the PDP Renewal and Nonrenewal Policy, we currently expect sponsors that non-renew a PBP while continuing to offer individual market plans in the PBP\u2019s service area to crosswalk affected enrollees into a renewing PBP. As noted previously in section IV.AD.2. of this proposed rule, in recent years about 20 percent of beneficiaries in non-renewing plans that were not crosswalked failed to select new Part D coverage. These beneficiaries not only lose Part D coverage, but also may be subject to higher premiums when they reenroll in Part D because of the late enrollment penalty required under \u00a7 423.46. CMS has also sought to prevent sponsors from engaging in adverse selection by discontinuing a PBP, dropping its enrollees, and immediately starting a new PBP with the intention of attracting lower cost or otherwise more desirable \nenrollees. \nHowever, in recent years, some plan \ncrosswalks in these situations have resulted in premium increases of as much as 381 percent. In 2021, the median premium increase for such crosswalks was over 234 percent. While not every consolidated renewal crosswalk results in a premium increase, and increases are typically much smaller than those experienced in 2021, such large premium increases create a significant burden for beneficiaries. CMS has received significant complaints from beneficiaries who were surprised by large premium increases following a \ncrosswalk. Affected contracts had more complaints than other contracts in the first three months after enrollees were crosswalked. To address this concern, we propose requirements for consolidated renewals that would reflect our current subregulatory policy, but with four significant differences. \nFirst, we propose at \u00a7 423.530(c)(1) to \nallow, but not require, plan crosswalks in consolidated renewal scenarios. PDP sponsors could request a crosswalk of enrollment from a non-renewing PBP to another PBP under the same contract, provided it meets the requirements we are proposing. \nWe propose at \u00a7 423.530(c)(1)(i) \nthrough (iv) to codify provisions of our current policy for consolidated renewal crosswalks: \n\u2022The plan ID for the upcoming \ncontract year PBP must be the same plan ID as one of the PBPs for the current contract year; \n\u2022The PBPs being consolidated must \nbe under the same PDP contract; \n\u2022A PBP offering basic prescription \ndrug coverage may not be discontinued if the PDP contract continues to offer plans (other than employer group waiver plans) in the service area of the PBP; and \n\u2022Enrollment from a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative coverage may be crosswalked either into a PBP offering either enhanced alternative or basic prescription drug coverage. \nOur second major proposed change \nfrom current policy, at \u00a7 423.530(c)(1)(v), is that when a PDP sponsor chooses to crosswalk in a consolidated renewal scenario, to require enrollees from non-renewing PBPs offering enhanced alternative coverage to be crosswalked into the PBP that will result in the lowest premium increase. We intend for this requirement to minimize the premium increases experienced by beneficiaries who are crosswalked to new PBPs under a consolidated renewal crosswalk.

We recognize that premiums \nare not the only aspect of a PBP\u2019s structure that affect costs to beneficiaries or the beneficiary experience. The PBP\u2019s formulary and cost-sharing structure are also important elements affecting beneficiary costs. However, premiums for a PBP are the same for every enrollee and are therefore the most straightforward factor to use to protect enrollees from unexpected cost increases. We are soliciting comments on whether we should use other factors, such as differences in estimated out of pocket costs (OOPC) between the non-renewing and surviving PBPs, rather than simply the difference in plan premiums, to determine whether approving a plan crosswalk exception is the best option for enrollees in a non-renewing PBP. We are also requesting comments on whether to allow plan crosswalks to a \nhigher premium plan if the difference between the higher premium plan and the lower premium plan is less than a certain dollar amount\u2014for example, should CMS permit a crosswalk to a higher premium surviving PBP despite the availability of a lower premium surviving PBP if the difference between the premiums is less than a fixed dollar amount. \nThird, we propose at \n\u00a7 423.530(c)(2)(vi) to prohibit plan crosswalks for consolidated renewals if the crosswalk would result in a premium increase greater than 100 percent, unless the dollar amount of the premium increase would be less than the base beneficiary premium, as described in \u00a7 423.286(c), compared to the current year premium for the non- renewing PBP. CMS does not currently explicitly limit premium increases for renewing PBPs; however, CMS does have the authority under section1860D\u2013 11(d)(3) of the Act and \u00a7 423.265(b)(3) to decline to approve a bid that proposes significant increases in cost sharing or \ndecreases in benefits. CMS negotiates with sponsors pursuant to this authority in order to limit increases in cost sharing or decreases in benefits, but not \nto explicitly limit premium increases. \nRenewing PBPs therefore sometimes \nexperience high premium increases. \nDespite this, in the past two years a larger share of consolidated renewal crosswalks have had premium increases of 100 percent or more compared to renewal PBPs. Only 0.8 percent of 906 PDP PBPs renewing for 2021 and 1.8 percent of 729 PBPs renewing for 2022 had premium increases greater than 100 percent. By contrast, 94.3 percent of 35 consolidated renewal crosswalks for 2021 and 29.6 percent for 2022 had premium increases greater than 100 percent. \nPremium changes are also more \nvariable year-to-year for consolidated renewal crosswalks. For the past 5 years, the average premium change for renewal PBPs ranged from an increase of 3.3 percent in 2019 to an increase of 15.9 percent in 2022. In the same time period, consolidated renewal crosswalks resulted in average premium changes that ranged from a decrease of 38.7 percent in 2019 to an increase of 229.5 percent in 2021. The data is summarized in Table 3. \nBecause of the compressed time \nframes between bid submission and \napproval, CMS would base its assessment of premiums for the following plan year on information received with the initial bids on the first Monday in June. Bids are subject to change during the bid negotiation process, so a premium increase that appears acceptable in June may be higher by the time final bids are approved in August. However, the timing of plan crosswalk exceptions and bid review prevent CMS from basing crosswalk exception approvals on final \nbid amounts. Based on historical experience, we do not believe that there is significant risk that final premiums will differ substantially from those in the initial bid. We are soliciting comments on whether this timing may result in manipulation of bids and whether another measure of beneficiary costs, such as estimated OOPC, would be a more reliable measure to use given the difficulty of basing crosswalk approvals on final approved bids. \nWe recognize that some non-renewing \nplans may have very low premiums.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83c5f293-70c5-431b-8c57-fa0f780ae597": {"__data__": {"id_": "83c5f293-70c5-431b-8c57-fa0f780ae597", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da131e4c-1ed6-4a3c-a153-920cf74c2dbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b94044a60b746eea66d8559053e0072ac7fde8ab0adef859ac4a68ec108c121a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c732c56-27d1-4714-9799-261e048abe26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e965c530d5144f0163139cb7522563b451576823875cab9bd79d560d6cee8507"}}, "hash": "d80e17ff78ab4367d80775b8871694b3f878205347fdde0dfc99cd909c6ece6e", "text": "We recognize that some non-renewing \nplans may have very low premiums.

We do not wish to prohibit plan crosswalk exceptions that would result in a large percentage increase and a relatively small dollar amount increase. Therefore, we propose to allow plan crosswalk exceptions where the premium increase would exceed 100 percent if the dollar amount of the premium increase would be less than the base beneficiary premium, as described in \u00a7 423.286(c), for the current year.

For example, if a sponsor non-renews an enhanced alternative PBP effective 12/31/2023 and did not request and receive a plan crosswalk exception, we would decline to approve a new enhanced alternative PBP starting January 1, 2024. In other words, the earliest the sponsor would be permitted to create new PBP to replace the non-renewed PBP would be the 2025 plan year. We propose to adopt this restriction pursuant to the Secretary\u2019s authority at section 1857(e) of the Act, made applicable to the Part D program by section 1860D\u201312(b)(3) of the Act, to adopt additional terms and conditions as the Secretary may find necessary and appropriate. The proposed limitation on creating new PBPs would encourage sponsors to request plan crosswalk exceptions and discourage them from using the non- renewal process to disenroll beneficiaries who are high cost or who they otherwise no longer wish to serve. We believe this proposed policy will prevent discrimination and instability in the market. This policy is also consistent with other requirements in the Part D regulation, such as the restrictions at \u00a7\u00a7 423.507(a)(3), 423.508(e), and 423.510(e)(1) on CMS entering into a new contract with sponsors that non-renewed or terminated a Part D contract for two years following the nonrenewal or termination. \nThese four proposed changes \nrepresent a significant shift from current policy. As such, we are soliciting comments on alternative approaches. Possible alternatives include, but are not limited to: (1) requiring plan crosswalks when a sponsor non-renews an enhanced alternative PBP while continuing to offer individual market coverage under the same PDP contract, but prohibiting sponsors from creating a new PBP to replace the non-renewing PBP; (2) adopting the requirements as proposed, but prohibiting sponsors from creating new PBPs to replace non- renewing PBPs even if a plan crosswalk \nexception is requested and received; (3) using an alternative measure, such as OOPC, instead of or in addition to plan \npremiums to assess whether a plan crosswalk exception should be granted; or (4) adopting the current subregulatory policy without modification. \nWe are also proposing requirements \nfor contract consolidations that would reflect our current subregulatory policy, but with two significant differences that parallel the proposals with respect to consolidated renewals. For contract consolidations, consistent with our current policy, we propose at \u00a7 423.530(c)(2) to approve plan crosswalk exceptions from non- renewing PBPs into PBPs in the surviving contract when the surviving contract is held by the same sponsor or by a subsidiary of that sponsor\u2019s parent organization. We propose at \u00a7 423.530(c))(2)(i)\u2013(iv) to adopt the following requirements of current subregulatory policy: \n\u2022The non-renewing PDP contract and \nthe surviving contract must be held by the same legal entity or by legal entities with the same parent organization; \n\u2022The approved service area of the \nsurviving contract must include the service area of the non-renewing PBPs whose enrollment will be crosswalked into the surviving contract; \n\u2022Enrollment may be crosswalked \nbetween PBPs offering the same type of prescription drug coverage (basic or enhanced alternative); and \n\u2022Enrollment from a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative coverage may be \ncrosswalked into a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage. \nThe first significant change we \npropose to current subregulatory policy for contract consolidations is at \u00a7 423.530(c)(2)(v), which would require plan crosswalks from non-renewing PBPs offering enhanced alternative coverage into the PBP that would result in the lowest premium increase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e76d696-2e32-4045-be26-63391a817c46": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e76d696-2e32-4045-be26-63391a817c46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7c27621-9409-4d4d-95c9-0be2c37b062c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b1ac393ecbb92c7ba552aa789a3e4f6876f54f06287a09317382486042797ffe"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0eed5ec-46f1-4548-94f0-362cac41d961", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "963ae0c9523a64b2e39bff8b3cf6821badfbeeaf56acef5bb75b34ce1daebf9f"}}, "hash": "ee75a716653ab10e5ec5008094dafc8c9c1c971f85361ab98571f1021b1191b3", "text": "Second, we propose at \u00a7 423.530(c)(2)(vi) to prohibit plan crosswalks that would result in a premium increase greater than 100 percent, unless the dollar amount of the premium increase would be less than the base beneficiary premium, as described in \u00a7 423.286(c), compared to the current year premium for the non- renewing PBP. We are proposing these modifications to current contract consolidation crosswalk policy for the same reasons outlined with respect to consolidated renewal crosswalks. We acknowledge that contract consolidations are infrequent compared to consolidated renewals\u2014as shown in Table 3, contract consolidation crosswalks occurred in only 2 of the last 5 years\u2014and that data unique to contract consolidation crosswalks is therefore less available. However, we believe that requirements for the different types of plan crosswalk exceptions should be as consistent as possible and are therefore proposing to apply the same requirements with respect to premium increases for consolidated renewal crosswalks to contract consolidation crosswalks. \nWe solicit comments on these \nproposals. \n6. Procedures for Requesting Plan \nCrosswalks (\u00a7 423.530(d)) \nWe propose to codify current \nprocedures for submitting plan crosswalks and or making plan crosswalk exception requests at \u00a7 423.530(d), as described in \u2018\u2018Bid Pricing Tool for Medicare Advantage Plans and Prescription Drug Plans\u2019\u2019 CMS\u201310142, posted for final comment pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 at 87 FR 2441 (February 14, 2022). We propose that a Part D sponsor must submit all allowable plan crosswalks in writing through the bid submission process in HPMS by the bid submission deadline. Through the bid submission process, the Part D sponsor may indicate if a plan crosswalk exception is needed at that time; however, the Part D sponsor must also request a crosswalk exception through the crosswalk exception functionality in HPMS. CMS would verify the exception request and notify the requesting Part D sponsor of the approval or denial of the request after the plan crosswalk exception request deadline. CMS would approve any plan crosswalk exception that met the requirements of the proposed regulation. Because plan crosswalks are requested when a PBP is non-renewing, a denied crosswalk request would result in the PBP being non-renewed without enrollment being crosswalked. Part D sponsors would be required to submit these exception requests to ensure that PBP enrollment is allocated properly. \nWe solicit comments on this proposal. \n7. Summary of Proposals \nIn summary, we are proposing to add \na new \u00a7 423.530 codifying plan crosswalk requirements and policy for PDP contracts. We propose making the following changes: \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (a)(2)(i), \nprohibit plan crosswalks between PBPs under one PDP contract to PBPs under a different contract, unless the contracts are held by the same Part D sponsor or by sponsors that are subsidiaries of the same parent organization; \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (a)(2)(ii), \nprohibit plan crosswalks that split the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00155 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8764189b-7d83-4bd1-88d5-d7a664ca97ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "8764189b-7d83-4bd1-88d5-d7a664ca97ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d609c84b-e8b4-407d-8196-58be998df212", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3c8c359821914b03e573d63a8a6904a7c8a046ffa5d4a3c3b8b1d15347d71640"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e6a92a9-7516-41ac-ad46-0ddc71084b86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "257d5d3d48ec2e44ed7bdf56be3a6f177d2b0e2958e879eb9b418649f75bf0dd"}}, "hash": "23a75669fdd2557692e18a130f083086ad55f704848be3c09de32b7d5e74d35e", "text": "79606 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nenrollment of one PBP into multiple \nPBPs; \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iii), \nprohibit plan crosswalks between a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage to a PBP offering enhanced alternative coverage; \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (b), require \nthat renewing PBPs keep their enrollment and plan IDs from the previous year; \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (c), codify \npolicy for plan crosswalk exceptions\u2014 including consolidated renewals and contract consolidations\u2014with certain modifications relative to current subregulatory policy; \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (c)(1), \npermit consolidated renewal crosswalks when a sponsor non-renews an enhanced alternative PDP PBP while continuing to offer individual market coverage under the same PDP contract; \n\u2022At proposed paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) \nand (c)(2)(v), require that enrollment for enhanced alternative PBPs crosswalked pursuant to a crosswalk exception be crosswalked to the available PBP with the lowest premium increase; \n\u2022At proposed paragraphs (c)(1)(v) \nand (c)(2)(vi), prohibit plan crosswalks that would result in premium increase greater than 100 percent or higher than the base beneficiary premium for the current year, whichever is greater; and \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (c)(1)(vi), \nprohibit an organization that non- renews an enhanced alternative PBP without requesting and receiving a plan crosswalk exception from creating a new enhanced alternative PBP in the following contract year. \n\u2022At proposed paragraph (d), codify \nthe process for requesting plan crosswalks for renewals and crosswalk exceptions. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nAE. Drug Management Program (DMP) \nAppeal Procedures (\u00a7 423.562) \nThe Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amended section 1860D\u20134(c)(5)(A) of the Act to provide that Part D plan sponsors may establish drug management programs (DMPs) for at-risk beneficiaries to reduce opioid overutilization in the Part D program. Subsequently, section 2004 of the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act provided that Part D plan sponsors must implement a DMP for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. \nWe are proposing a technical change \nat \u00a7 423.562(a)(1)(v) that would remove discretionary language as it relates to a Part D plan sponsor\u2019s responsibility to \nestablish a DMP under \u00a7 423.153(f) with appeal procedures that meet the requirements of subpart M for issues that involve at-risk determinations. This would eliminate the discretionary language and improve consistency with \u00a7 423.153(f), which requires each Part D plan sponsor to establish and maintain a drug management program and include appeal procedures that meet the requirements of subpart M for issues involving at-risk determinations. This provision would be strictly a technical change to the wording at \u00a7 423.562(a)(1)(v) and would not impact the underlying burden related to processing appeals of at-risk beneficiaries. Therefore, this proposal is not expected to have an economic impact beyond current operating expenses, and there is no paperwork burden or associated impact on the Medicare Trust Fund. \nWe solicit comments on this proposal. \nAF. Part D Sponsor Website Requirements (\u00a7\u00a7 423.2265(b)(12) and 423.2265(c)(1)(vi)) \nAs required under \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(h)(2), \n422.2265, 423.128(d)(2), and 423.2265, all plans must have a website that includes specific posted materials and content. We are proposing two changes to the Part D sponsor website requirements at \u00a7 423.2265. \nAt paragraph \u00a7 423.2265(b)(12), we \nare proposing a technical correction to delete a duplicate reference to the prescription drug transition policy, as this information is already listed as required website content at \n\u00a7 423.2265(b)(10). We propose to remove the reference to the \u2018\u2018Prescription Drug Transition policy\u2019\u2019 at paragraph (b)(12) and redesignate that paragraph as reserved. \nWe are also proposing to clarify the \nrequirements at \u00a7 423.2265(c)(1)(vi) to be consistent with longstanding policy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e6a92a9-7516-41ac-ad46-0ddc71084b86": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e6a92a9-7516-41ac-ad46-0ddc71084b86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d609c84b-e8b4-407d-8196-58be998df212", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3c8c359821914b03e573d63a8a6904a7c8a046ffa5d4a3c3b8b1d15347d71640"}, "2": {"node_id": "8764189b-7d83-4bd1-88d5-d7a664ca97ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "23a75669fdd2557692e18a130f083086ad55f704848be3c09de32b7d5e74d35e"}}, "hash": "257d5d3d48ec2e44ed7bdf56be3a6f177d2b0e2958e879eb9b418649f75bf0dd", "text": "Specifically, we wish to clarify that a Part D sponsor\u2019s utilization management criteria, as approved by CMS, must be posted on the plan\u2019s website by October 15 prior to the plan year. The regulation currently indicates that utilization management forms must be posted; however, we recognize that utilization management criteria themselves are distinct from the forms used to submit a coverage determination to satisfy said criteria. We understand that historically, Part D sponsors would post utilization management criteria within a customized coverage determination form for a particular drug. Part D sponsors still have the option of taking this approach; however, we have learned that in recent years, Part D sponsors have favored the approach of \nposting utilization management criteria without generating drug-specific utilization management forms. Specifically, Part D sponsors have used the CMS Part D Model Coverage Determination Request form referenced at \u00a7 423.2265(c)(2)(ii). This model form does not contain plan specific utilization management criteria. Plans may continue to take either approach\u2014 that is, posting plan-specific utilization management criteria within a custom form or separately from the model form. However, to account for the evolution in plan practice, we propose modifying paragraph \u00a7 423.2265(c)(1)(vi) to clarify the requirement that utilization management criteria (whether contained in a form or other format) must be posted on the plan\u2019s website by October 15 prior to the beginning of the plan year. By doing so, we ensure that beneficiaries can take the utilization criteria required to access a particular drug into account when evaluating their Part D plan options during the Annual Election Period (AEP).

At Part 422, subpart K, and Part 423, subpart K, we have codified provisions relating to the contracts between CMS and MA organizations and Part D sponsors, including a description of minimum terms that must be included in the contract; the duration of contracts; minimum enrollment, reporting, and prompt payment requirements; and provisions regarding the consolidation, nonrenewal, or termination of a contract. In addition, these contracts require compliance with the regulations governing the program, which are adopted as standards implementing and interpreting the statutory requirement and as new terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with, and necessary and appropriate for administration of, the MA and Part D programs. Our proposal here would add to those requirements. \nCMS makes monthly payments to MA \norganizations and Part D sponsors for each beneficiary enrolled in a plan for that month. If there is an update to the payment amount that was paid for a month, CMS will make an adjustment to a month\u2019s payment for a beneficiary in a later month. For example, if beneficiary\u2019s Medicaid eligibility for a month is changed, CMS will recalculate the payment for that month after receipt of the updated Medicaid eligibility status for a beneficiary and make a retroactive payment update to that month\u2019s payment in a later month. In addition, CMS reconciles a number of different payment amounts after specified periods of time to permit plan data submission for a payment year as described below. These reconciliations typically take place the year after a payment year and result in retroactive payment adjustments for the prior payment year. \nGenerally, MA organizations and Part \nD sponsors continue to offer plans to beneficiaries from year to year. From time to time, a contract between CMS and an MA organization or Part D sponsor may consolidate, nonrenew, or otherwise terminate as a result of a plan initiated termination, mutual termination, or CMS initiated termination. Once a contract has consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated, the retroactive payment adjustments for a year that would have been made had the contract remained in effect are not paid to the MA organization or Part D sponsor, but are held until after the reconciliations for the final payment year are calculated as \ndescribed below. After such time, all retroactive adjustments to payment for the consolidated, nonrenewed, or \notherwise terminated contract are totaled and either a net payment amount is made to the MA organization or Part D sponsor or an amount is charged to the MA organization or Part D sponsor.\n173 \nThe process used to determine the \nfinal net payments for an MA organization or Part D sponsor, provide notice of these amounts to the MA organization or Part D sponsor, adjudicate disputes, and receive or remit payment constitutes the final settlement process and begins at least 18 months following the end of the last contract year in which the contract was in effect. \nBefore CMS determines the final \nsettlement amount owed to or from an MA organization or Part D sponsor whose contract has consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated, CMS first completes a series of reconciliation activities and calculates the related payment adjustments for both consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated contracts as well as ongoing contracts: (1) MA risk adjustment reconciliation (described in \u00a7 422.310(g)), (2) Part D annual reconciliation (described in \u00a7\u00a7 423.336 and 423.343), (3) Coverage Gap Discount Program annual reconciliation (described in \u00a7 423.2320), and (4) medical loss ratio (MLR) report submission and remittance calculation (described in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2460, 422.2470. 423.2460 and 423.2470).

Note that these reconciliation amounts represent all of the reconciliation amounts that could be included in the final settlement calculation. Whether each reconciliation amount will factor into the final settlement amount for a particular contract will depend on the specifics of that contract. For example, MA risk adjustment reconciliation would not be performed for a prescription drug plan contract. \nThe final settlement adjustment \nperiod is the period of time between \nwhen the contract consolidates, nonrenews, or otherwise terminates and the date the MA organization or Part D sponsor is issued a notice of the final settlement amount (also referred to herein as the notice of final settlement). The length of the final settlement period is determined by the time it takes for these reconciliations and related payment adjustments to be completed. During this time, CMS continues to calculate payment adjustments that reflect changes in beneficiary status.\n174 \nCMS tracks all payment adjustments for a terminated contract for use in the final settlement for that contract. \nThe final settlement adjustment \nperiod ends on the date on the notice of final settlement that CMS issues to MA organizations and Part D sponsors. At the end of the final settlement adjustment period, CMS will no longer make adjustments to reconciliations for a contract that has consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated, that would otherwise have been made for a continuing contract. Once the notice of final settlement has been issued, contracts that have been consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated will also be excluded from all reopenings, including program-wide reopenings, or reconciliations for prior payment years when the contract was in effect. For example, under \u00a7 423.346, CMS has the authority to reopen and revise an initial or reconsidered Part D final payment determination, including the Part D reconciliation amounts included in the final settlement amount, for a prior payment year. However, this reopening would not apply to consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated contracts that have already received a notice of final settlement. This allows CMS to largely close out any outstanding financial responsibilities associated with consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated contracts, either on the part of CMS or on the part of the MA organization or Part D sponsor.\n175 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00157 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "199a7a96-db02-4256-bfc6-8846175272a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "199a7a96-db02-4256-bfc6-8846175272a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7952b556-cdc4-44b9-95be-38554e505655", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2d1745286b9ee063cd218a8e4a32dbed72e7bb19682bba7a430ae305088bc8af"}, "3": {"node_id": "f384b3cb-c204-4af3-96de-2d79174e0501", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "445e2dbd7b46eda1f01baed155f20e48c0828c4e508d16e19b19fc8f61167056"}}, "hash": "203201dbec82d76a2893f8f446b06f8e751a36a8060433de02b6642eaef5c8f2", "text": "79608 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nAfter determining the final settlement \namount, CMS issues a notice of final \nsettlement to the MA organization or Part D sponsor for each contract that has consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated, even if the final settlement amount is $0. The notice of final settlement explains whether the MA organization or Part D sponsor will receive or owe a final settlement amount and provides the information needed to conduct the associated financial transaction. The notice of final settlement includes the information CMS used to calculate the final settlement amount, including the payment adjustments that are reported on all monthly membership reports created from the date the contract ended until the month the final settlement amount was calculated. It also includes information on the process and timeline for requesting a review concerning the accuracy of the final settlement amount calculation. \nWe propose to codify longstanding \nand existing guidance pertaining to procedures for the final settlement process described in the above paragraphs. In addition, we propose to add a new appeals process for MA organizations or Part D sponsors that disagree with the final settlement amount. MAOs or Part D sponsors may request an appeal of the final settlement amount within 15 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice of final settlement. We believe that will provide organizations with sufficient time to request an appeal, as MA organizations and Part D sponsors would already be aware of the reconciliation amounts that factor into the final settlement amount at the time the notice of final settlement is issued, and requiring a request for appeal within this timeframe would help ensure accurate and timely payment of final settlement amounts. If an MA organization or Part D sponsor agrees with the final settlement amount, no response would be necessary or required. Failure to request appeal within 15 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice of final settlement would indicate acceptance of the final settlement amount. CMS would strongly encourage MA organizations and Part D sponsors to communicate their acceptance to CMS to facilitate prompt payment. \nFinally, in addition to codifying our \nlongstanding and existing review process under which MA organizations and Part D sponsors are able to request a reconsideration of CMS\u2019 final settlement amount calculation, we propose to add two additional levels of \nappeal: (1) an informal hearing conducted by the CMS Office of Hearings to review CMS\u2019 initial \ndetermination, following a request for appeal of the reconsideration of CMS\u2019 initial determination, and (2) a review by the CMS Administrator of the hearing officer\u2019s determination if there is an appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s determination. We believe that these additional levels of appeal will afford MA organizations and Part D sponsors sufficient opportunities to present objections to the calculation of the final settlement amount. This additional process would only be available to appeal CMS\u2019 final settlement amount calculation and would not be used to review any prior payments or reconciliation amounts. MA organizations and Part D sponsors seeking review of prior payments or reconciliation amounts must do so during the appropriate reconciliation process. CMS believes that these additional levels of appeal would only be used in exceptional circumstances given the narrow, mathematical nature of the final settlement process. We anticipate that calculation errors will be rare, and, if they do occur, that they will be quickly corrected to the mutual satisfaction of both parties without a need for further review. \n1. Process for MA Organizations and \nPart D Sponsors That Do Not Request an Appeal \nIf an MA organization or Part D \nsponsor that owes a final settlement amount to CMS does not request an appeal or provides an optional response acknowledging and confirming the amount owed to CMS within 15 calendar days of the date of the notice of final settlement, the MA organization or Part D sponsor would be required to remit full payment to CMS within 120 calendar days of receiving the notice of final settlement. If an MA organization or Part D sponsor is owed money and does not appeal the final settlement amount, CMS would remit payment to the MA organization or Part D sponsor within 60 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice of final settlement. If an MA organization or Part D sponsor does not owe or is not owed a final settlement amount and does not request an appeal of the $0 final settlement amount within 15 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice of final settlement, no further actions would occur. If an MA organization or Part D sponsor does not appeal the final settlement amount \nindicated in the notice of final settlement within 15 calendar days of the issuance of the notice of final settlement no subsequent requests for appeal would be considered. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f384b3cb-c204-4af3-96de-2d79174e0501": {"__data__": {"id_": "f384b3cb-c204-4af3-96de-2d79174e0501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7952b556-cdc4-44b9-95be-38554e505655", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2d1745286b9ee063cd218a8e4a32dbed72e7bb19682bba7a430ae305088bc8af"}, "2": {"node_id": "199a7a96-db02-4256-bfc6-8846175272a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "203201dbec82d76a2893f8f446b06f8e751a36a8060433de02b6642eaef5c8f2"}}, "hash": "445e2dbd7b46eda1f01baed155f20e48c0828c4e508d16e19b19fc8f61167056", "text": "2.

Once all levels of appeal are exhausted or the MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to request further review within the 15-day timeframe, CMS would communicate with the MA organization or Part D sponsor to complete the financial transaction associated with the issuance or payment of the final settlement amount, as appropriate. \nAt all levels of review, the MA \norganization or Part D sponsor\u2019s appeal would be limited to CMS\u2019 calculation of the final settlement amount. CMS would not consider information submitted for the purposes of retroactively adjusting a prior reconciliation.

The proposed definition provides that CMS would calculate the final settlement amount by summing retroactive payment adjustments for a contract that accumulate after that contract consolidates non-renews, or otherwise terminates, but before the calculation of the final settlement amount, including the applicable reconciliation amounts that have been completed as of the date the notice of final settlement has been issued, without accounting for any data submitted after the data submission deadlines for calculating the reconciliation amounts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adf4f400-d5e1-4500-afcd-fd6e68199efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "adf4f400-d5e1-4500-afcd-fd6e68199efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d41bd91-482c-4314-8ec2-41fe99a083d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "deec20f91a92c29c351c9538e224fc16dcd7df2badc92d44ba4342b47dd2c75d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6e70959-7101-45fc-a84c-d9478a3279b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "43eb3feeb4934e01d6202aedcb7ca720ba17aa68905f04a5e311ffaca107a9d0"}}, "hash": "7b8a49c12cd4668bc56de32e390a4bd5ade5ea9321ecb8b188247814036c809d", "text": "These reconciliation amounts used in this process are: (1) MA risk adjustment reconciliation (described in \u00a7 422.310), (2) Part D annual reconciliation (described in \u00a7\u00a7 423.336 and 423.343), (3) Coverage Gap Discount Program annual reconciliation (described in \u00a7 423.2320), and (4) MLR report submission, including calculation of remittances (described in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2470 and 423.2470). \nWe propose to add a definition for the \nterm final settlement process, which we \npropose to define as the process by which CMS would calculate the final \nsettlement amount for a Medicare Advantage or Part D contract that has been consolidated, nonrenewed, or otherwise terminated, issue the final settlement amount along with supporting documentation (described above) in the notice of final settlement to the MA organization or Part D sponsor, receive responses from MA organizations and Part D sponsors requesting an appeal of the final settlement amount, and take final actions to adjudicate an appeal (if requested) and make payments to or receive final payments from MA organizations or Part D sponsors. The proposed definition of final settlement process would specify that the final \nsettlement process begins after all applicable reconciliations have been completed. \nb. Final Settlement Process and \nPayment \nWe propose to add \u00a7\u00a7 422.528 (for \nMA) and 423.521 (for Part D) to our regulations to codify our process for notifying MA organizations and Part D sponsors of the final settlement amount and how payments to or from CMS would be made. \nOnce CMS has calculated the final \nsettlement amount, we would notify MA organizations and Part D sponsors of the final settlement amount. At paragraph (a) of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.528 (for MA) and 423.521 (for Part D), we propose to codify that CMS would send a notice of final settlement to MA organizations and Part D sponsors. Specifically, proposed paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) specify that the notice would contain at least the following information: a final settlement amount; relevant banking and financial mailing instructions for MA organizations and Part D sponsors that owe CMS a final settlement amount; relevant CMS \ncontact information; and a description of the steps for the MA organizations or Part D sponsor to request an appeal of the final settlement amount calculation. \nCMS is seeking comment on the \nfollowing proposals, which would change the current final settlement process. At paragraph (b) of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.528 and 423.521, we propose to establish that MA organizations and Part D sponsors would have 15 calendar days from the date of issuance of the notice to request an appeal. We propose at paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of these new regulation sections that, if an MA organization or Part D sponsor agrees with the final settlement amount, no response would be required, and that, if an MA organization or Part D sponsor does not request an appeal within 15 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00159 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6b05b25-9cb3-421d-b6f1-5e6b08532301": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6b05b25-9cb3-421d-b6f1-5e6b08532301", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "617c7fff-bf34-47d5-912e-945c7eb2a515", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e5ebe2b879628b78f13f53ec82b997b0f7b431b20193ab7687d0c620fe4a5dbc"}, "3": {"node_id": "93a06124-21d2-4ff6-9a82-f07c5f982903", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "12c50c0bab4c62041d4f5f9b57a79cd5d4e3743eb843602ffded2b5c163df518"}}, "hash": "bb3220aa08f7d654807eb34f18507a8cc083519a5b89e047667ca43c24532916", "text": "79610 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n176In the case of a bankrupt or liquidated plan \nthat owes CMS money, CMS still completes the \nreconciliations and the final settlement process and issues a notice of final settlement, but refers the plan to the Department of Justice to collect the money owed. calendar days, CMS would not consider \nany subsequent requests for appeal of the final settlement amount. \nAt proposed paragraph (c), we \npropose to codify the actions that would take place if an MA organization or Part D sponsor does not appeal the final settlement amount.

Specifically, at proposed paragraph \n(a)(1), we propose to establish the \nprocess under which an MA organization or Part D sponsor may request reconsideration of the final settlement amount. We propose to specify that the 15-calendar-day period for filing the request would begin on the date the notice of final settlement from CMS is issued. We also propose that MA organizations and Part D sponsors would have to include in their request the calculations with which they disagree and that the MA organization or Part D sponsor would have the obligation to provide evidence supporting the assertion that the CMS calculation of the final settlement amount is incorrect. We further specify that MA organizations and Part D sponsors should not submit new reconciliation data or data that was submitted to CMS after the final settlement notice was issued. CMS would not consider information submitted for the purposes of retroactively adjusting a prior reconciliation. \nAt proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii), we \npropose to establish that the CMS reconsideration official would review the calculations that were used to determine the final settlement amount and any additional evidence timely submitted by the MA organization or Part D sponsor.

Gross Covered Prescription Drug Costs (\u00a7 423.308) \nSection 1860D\u201315(b)(3) of the the Act \ndefines \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 as, \u2018\u2018with respect to a part D eligible individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA\u2013PD plan \nduring a coverage year, the costs incurred under the plan, not including administrative costs, but including costs directly related to the dispensing of covered part D drugs during the year and costs relating to the deductible. Such costs shall be determined whether they are paid by the individual or under the plan, regardless of whether the coverage under the plan exceeds basic prescription drug coverage.\u2019\u2019 In our final rule, \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit,\u2019\u2019 published in the Federal Register on January 28, \n2005 (70 FR 4194), we codified the definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.308. This regulatory definition refers to \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 as \u2018\u2018actually paid costs.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 has a specific meaning in Medicare Part D and is separately defined at \u00a7 423.308 to mean costs actually incurred by the plan that are net of direct and indirect remuneration (DIR), including discounts, rebates, or other price concessions typically received and \napplied after the point of sale. However, unlike the statutory definitions of \u2018\u2018allowable reinsurance costs\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018allowable risk corridor costs\u2019\u2019 at sections 1860D\u201315(b)(2) and 1860D\u2013 15(e)(1)(B) of the Act, respectively, the statutory definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 at section 1860D\u201315(b)(3) of the Act does not use the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 or otherwise specify that such costs must be net of all DIR. Because the definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 was codified in regulation for the sole purpose of describing the methodology for calculating the reinsurance payment amount, in using the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 in said regulatory definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs,\u2019\u2019 CMS was incorporating a requirement from the statutory definition of \u2018\u2018allowable reinsurance costs\u2019\u2019 to emphasize that DIR would be netted out in the calculation of costs eligible for Part D reinsurance as required by the statute. \nWe note that certain provisions added \nto the Social Security Act by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) refer to \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs as defined in section 1860D\u2013 15(b)(3) [of the Act]\u2019\u2019 (see sections 1191(c)(5) and 1860D\u201314C(g)(4)(D) of the Act). Accordingly, we believe it is an appropriate time to revisit our regulatory definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 to mirror the statute\u2019s language and to remove any ambiguity that might arise from the current regulatory definition as it may now also be applicable outside of the reinsurance context.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "566cc709-73ec-4256-a2a1-343c2afbb93d": {"__data__": {"id_": "566cc709-73ec-4256-a2a1-343c2afbb93d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ec523ab-19de-4e12-9b2e-a50c19e283c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b5a5509db0cde359ec6a831264afd5eaef3b968b01663218befbb5d851aed628"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2d7c349-b9f4-4ae4-8f58-d2cc33b09aa4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "38f67b5c5e367f46c5bd8357039f4d99d1a89fe1f0bdca0949a8d87ed4c28449"}}, "hash": "b156a54b5711309c03f7165c425e4acc844fa5c17e9303e06e72dd9ae86be4ee", "text": "Therefore, we propose to amend the definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.308 to remove the phrase \n\u2018\u2018actually paid.\u2019\u2019 \nRevising the definition as proposed \nwould not change the fact that Part D reinsurance is ultimately based on net drug costs or change the final reinsurance payment amount a Part D sponsor receives. Rather, as explained further below, allowable reinsurance costs would continue to be defined at \u00a7 423.308 as the subset of gross covered prescription drug costs actually paid. The proposed revision, therefore, would not constitute a change in policy or require a change in operations under Part D, and thus would not place any additional burden or reduce burden on Part D sponsors, nor result in government savings or costs. \n1. Background \nThe term \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription \ndrug costs\u2019\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as \n\u2018\u2018GCPDC\u2019\u2019) is defined and used at section 1860D\u201315(b) of the Act for the purpose of describing the methodology for calculating the reinsurance payment amount. As specified in section 1860D\u2013 15(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the reinsurance payment amount for a year preceding 2025 is equal to \u2018\u201880 percent of the allowable reinsurance costs (as specified in paragraph (2)) attributable to that portion of gross covered prescription drug costs as specified in paragraph (3) incurred in the coverage year after such individual has incurred costs that exceed the annual out-of-pocket threshold specified in section 1860D\u2013 2(b)(4)(B).\u2019\u2019 As noted above, although the statutory definition of \u2018\u2018allowable reinsurance costs\u2019\u2019 at paragraph (2) of section 1860D\u201315(b) of the Act specifies that such costs are the subset of GCPDC that are \u2018\u2018actually paid (net of discounts, chargebacks, and average percentage rebates),\u2019\u2019 the statutory definition of GCPDC at paragraph (3) of that provision does not use the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 or otherwise specify that such costs must be net of all DIR. This distinction, coupled with the use of the modifier \u2018\u2018gross\u2019\u2019 to describe these costs indicates that the best reading of section 1860D\u201315(b)(3) of the Act is that GCPDC should reflect gross costs, not net costs that reflect all DIR that a Part D sponsor may receive. As stated above, CMS\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 in the current regulatory definition of GCPDC was intended to emphasize that all DIR would be netted out in the calculation of costs eligible for Part D reinsurance consistent with the plain language of the statute, which requires that the reinsurance payment amount be based on net drug costs. While the use of the phrase in the current regulatory definition of GCPDC is consistent with the statute for this reason, we recognize that that it may have led to ambiguity as to when the DIR would be netted out. We also recognize that the use of the phrase could create ambiguity when GCPDC is referenced outside of the reinsurance context (as it now is by the IRA). \nIt is important to note that the \nstatutory definition of GCPDC further describes these costs as \u2018\u2018not including administrative costs, but including costs directly related to the dispensing of covered Part D drugs during the year and costs relating to the deductible.\u2019\u2019 CMS has long held that costs directly related to the dispensing of covered Part D drugs are most logically calculated as the accumulated total of the negotiated prices that are used for purposes of determining payment to the pharmacy or other dispensing entity for covered Part D drugs, and which are required \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00161 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55e92d5e-dd03-4bd9-8274-67b84a0e8684": {"__data__": {"id_": "55e92d5e-dd03-4bd9-8274-67b84a0e8684", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b721b345-f0e4-4f07-b2a7-e44431d37728", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "65bf6020568cdd4b8d78b5bf815088945640824d3663c0b32e78593a79a8d916"}, "3": {"node_id": "179be657-d893-4dc8-bcbd-71b22c31db83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "948d1275fab556cdfea677ba303551e6f275950872ae7f6775d91b03b06503b1"}}, "hash": "aaaaea0c7fcf760385a4f50558187b35b7f85825a7b4114938258140c720df0f", "text": "79612 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n177This logic is borne out in the portion of our \ncurrent regulatory definition of GCPDC at \u00a7 423.308 \nthat states that GCPDC reflect \u2018\u2018actual costs.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Actual cost\u2019\u2019 is defined at \u00a7 423.100 as the negotiated price for a covered Part D drug when the drug is purchased at a network pharmacy, and the usual and customary price when a beneficiary purchases the drug at an out-of-network pharmacy. \n178The different components of the negotiated \nprice of a drug, and ultimately of GCPDC, are required to be reported separately using the following cost fields on the Prescription Drug Event (PDE) record submitted to CMS by Part D plan sponsors for payment purposes, the sum of which must equal GCPDC: Ingredient Cost, Dispensing Fee, Vaccination Administration, and Sales Tax. GCPDC are also required to be reported using the following two payment fields on the PDE record depending on whether the costs fall in the catastrophic phase: Gross Drug Cost Below the Out of Pocket (OOP) Threshold (GDCB) and Gross Drug Cost Above the OOP Threshold (GDCA). The amounts reported in these fields are then used to update the Total Gross Covered Drug Cost (TGCDC) Accumulator on the PDE record, which tracks and indicates which non-catastrophic phase of the Part D benefit the beneficiary is in.

Therefore, even if the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 were not included in the regulatory definition of GCPDC, GCPDC would continue to be reduced by POS DIR reflected in negotiated prices.

Proposed Change \nConsistent with the language of \nsection 1860D\u201315(b) of the Act, policy, \nincluding the current reporting requirements, and operations, including how the industry tracks and reports costs (that is, industry practice), we propose to amend the definition of \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs\u2019\u2019 at \u00a7 423.308 to remove the two references to \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 to clarify \nthat GCPDC are not net of all DIR. \nThe proposed change would have no \nimpact on Part D payment calculations or reporting requirements. Consistent with section 1860D\u201315(b)(2), the reinsurance payment amount would continue to be calculated based on drug costs net of DIR. Outside of the reinsurance context, CMS\u2019 long-standing operational guidance has instructed plans to report costs without first netting out DIR applied after the point of sale, and, thus, the guidance would not need to be adjusted as a result of this proposed change to the regulatory definition of GCPDC. For instance, the amounts reported in the Ingredient Cost, Dispensing Fee, Vaccine Administration, Sales Tax, GDCB, GDCA, and the TGCDC Accumulator fields on the PDE record are required to include costs incurred by the Part D sponsor and all amounts paid by or on behalf of an enrollee under a Part D plan.\n179Further, CMS guidance \ninstructs Part D sponsors to net out only plan administrative costs and any DIR applied at the POS when reporting GCPDC.\n180Hence, a key step in \ncalculating the Part D reinsurance payment amount is to determine the allowable reinsurance cost amount by subtracting from the GCPDC incurred in the catastrophic phase all DIR attributable to the proportion of catastrophic phase spending that was not already accounted for at the POS in order to determine the amount \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 by the Part D plan and ensure that the reinsurance payment amount is ultimately calculated based on net drug costs. As we would continue to take this important step in determining allowable reinsurance costs for purposes of \ncalculating the reinsurance payment amount even if \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 were removed from the regulatory definition of GCPDC as proposed, there would be no change in the final reinsurance payment amount a Part D sponsor receives. \nMoreover, no other rules or policies \nwould be affected by this proposed change, including the rules regarding how to account for coverage not provided by the Part D sponsor, and instead provided by other payers, because they do not directly address the calculation of the reinsurance payment amount and thus do not rely on the current regulatory definition of GCPDC. For example, under rules regarding Medicare secondary payer (MSP) or subrogated claims, the amounts reported in the cost and payment fields of the PDE record reflect a reduction in the Part D plan\u2019s incurred cost for a drug resulting from other payer arrangements, which are currently and will continue to be captured in GCPDC. \nWe note that in a rulemaking \npublished earlier this year, we amended our regulations at \u00a7 423.100, to add a new definition of \u2018\u2018negotiated price\u2019\u2019 effective January 1, 2024. The new definition specifies, among other things, that the negotiated price for a Part D drug is the lowest possible reimbursement a network pharmacy will receive, in total, for the drug, net of all pharmacy price concessions. Thus, as of January 1, 2024, all price concessions from network pharmacies, negotiated by Part D sponsors and their contracted pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), will be reflected in the negotiated price that is made available at the POS and reported to CMS on a PDE record, meaning that these pharmacy price concessions will be reflected in GCPDC even if the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 is removed from the regulatory definition of the term as proposed. As noted above, accounting for DIR, including pharmacy price concessions, applied at the point of sale in the calculation of GCPDC, does not make the resulting amount \u2018\u2018actually paid,\u2019\u2019 which requires accounting for all DIR, including DIR not applied at the POS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13997386-7145-4952-96cc-c8e5fdd24aaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "13997386-7145-4952-96cc-c8e5fdd24aaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b721b345-f0e4-4f07-b2a7-e44431d37728", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "65bf6020568cdd4b8d78b5bf815088945640824d3663c0b32e78593a79a8d916"}, "2": {"node_id": "179be657-d893-4dc8-bcbd-71b22c31db83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "948d1275fab556cdfea677ba303551e6f275950872ae7f6775d91b03b06503b1"}}, "hash": "701c9794ef15f46bc684550934575e785492c5fe76b9b453ccf96fb196d1431c", "text": "While this proposed change to the \nregulatory definition would not be a \nchange in policy and would not directly affect the way in which GCPDC are calculated and used for purposes of Part D, we believe it is important to revise the definition to remove any ambiguity regarding the meaning of the term \u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs.\u2019\u2019 As noted previously, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 added provisions \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00162 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8beaf0f-d4bf-43c1-9231-008abdac54ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8beaf0f-d4bf-43c1-9231-008abdac54ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68789610-39f9-455e-bd42-a47647e530ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d9e2884a2f071237c2b2780f68ec2693bc93eb492031cf5a60c8feeeac55001"}, "3": {"node_id": "0abaf6ed-47bc-423e-9e52-662bc329d5d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "00d4704a442413f4c790d44ccad6db4d4386b0526a22c8c0ee11a3baa3f5d21f"}}, "hash": "bd0b0d9d6ac95a5e403327e17c193afaea7d9cb18e2f08fc46e2a47713904157", "text": "79613 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nto the Social Security Act that refer to \n\u2018\u2018gross covered prescription drug costs as defined in section 1860D\u201315(b)(3) [of the Act].\u2019\u2019 Removing the phrase \u2018\u2018actually paid\u2019\u2019 from the regulatory definition of GCPDC as proposed would eliminate any ambiguity in the regulation text and help to ensure there is a consistent understanding of the meaning of this term for purposes of both the Part D program and the relevant provisions of the IRA. \nNothing in this proposal places \nadditional requirements on Part D sponsors or beneficiaries or changes how CMS currently uses the GCPDC reported by the Part D sponsor on the PDE for purposes of determining payments under Part D.

Introduction \nCMS develops and publicly posts a 5- \nstar rating system for Medicare \nAdvantage (MA)/Part C and Part D plans based on the requirement to disseminate comparative information, including information about quality, to beneficiaries under sections 1851(d) and 1860D\u20131(c) of the Act and the collection of different types of quality data under section 1852(e) of the Act. The Part C and Part D Star Ratings system is used to determine quality bonus payment (QBP) ratings for MA plans under section 1853(o) of the Act and the amount of beneficiary rebates under section 1854(b) of the Act. Cost plans under section 1876 of the Act are also included in the MA and Part D Star Ratings system, as codified at \u00a7 417.472(k). We use multiple data sources to measure quality and performance of contracts, such as CMS administrative data, surveys of enrollees, information provided directly from health and drug plans, and data collected by CMS contractors. Various regulations, including \u00a7\u00a7 417.472(j) and (k), 422.152(b), 423.153(c), and 423.156, require plans to report on quality improvement and quality assurance and to provide data which help beneficiaries compare plans. The methodology for the Star Ratings system for the MA and Part D programs is codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.160 \nthrough 422.166 and 423.180 through 423.186, respectively, and we have specified the measures used in setting Star Ratings through rulemaking. In addition, the cost plan regulation at \u00a7 417.472(k) requires cost contracts to be subject to the Part 422 and 423 Medicare Advantage and Part D Prescription Drug Program Quality Rating System. (83 FR 16526\u201327). As a result, the proposals here would apply to the quality ratings for MA plans, cost plans, and Part D plans. We generally use \u2018\u2018Part C\u2019\u2019 to refer to the quality measures and ratings system that applies to MA plan and cost plans. \nWe have continued to identify \nenhancements to the Star Ratings program to ensure it is aligned with the CMS Quality Strategy as that Strategy evolves over time. This includes clarifications as well as improvements related to the current methodology based on our recent experiences related to the impact of COVID\u201319 on quality \nmeasurement. The current CMS National Quality Strategy encourages the highest quality outcomes, safest care, equity, and accessibility for all individuals (https://www.cms.gov/ Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient- Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based- Programs/CMS-Quality-Strategy). In addition to focusing on a person-centric approach as individuals move across the continuum of care, the current CMS Quality Strategy aims to create a more equitable, safe, and outcomes-based health care system and, where feasible, works to align performance metrics, programs, and policy across CMS programs. \nIn this proposed rule, we are \nproposing a health equity index reward to further incentivize Part C and D plans to focus on improving care for enrollees with social risk factors (SRFs), and this proposal supports CMS efforts to ensure attainment of the highest level of health for all people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0abaf6ed-47bc-423e-9e52-662bc329d5d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0abaf6ed-47bc-423e-9e52-662bc329d5d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68789610-39f9-455e-bd42-a47647e530ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5d9e2884a2f071237c2b2780f68ec2693bc93eb492031cf5a60c8feeeac55001"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8beaf0f-d4bf-43c1-9231-008abdac54ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bd0b0d9d6ac95a5e403327e17c193afaea7d9cb18e2f08fc46e2a47713904157"}}, "hash": "00d4704a442413f4c790d44ccad6db4d4386b0526a22c8c0ee11a3baa3f5d21f", "text": "We are also proposing to make changes in the specific measures used in the Star Ratings System: \n\u2022Remove the Part C Diabetes Care\u2014 \nKidney Disease Monitoring measure; \n\u2022Remove the stand-alone Part C \nMedication Reconciliation Post- discharge measure; \n\u2022Add the updated Part C Colorectal \nCancer Screening measure with the NCQA specification change; \n\u2022Add the updated Part C Care for \nOlder Adults\u2014Functional Status Assessment measures with the NCQA specification change; \n\u2022Add the updated Part D Medication \nAdherence for Diabetes Medication, Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists), Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Statins) measures (including non-substantive changes to the specifications). \n\u2022Add the Part C Kidney Health \nEvaluation for Patients with Diabetes measure; \n\u2022Add the Part D Concurrent Use of \nOpioids and Benzodiazepines measure; \n\u2022Add the Part D Polypharmacy Use \nof Multiple Anticholinergic Medications in Older Adults measure; and \n\u2022Add the Part D Polypharmacy Use \nof Multiple Central Nervous System Active Medications in Older Adults measure. \nWe are also proposing to make several \nmethodological changes: \n\u2022Reduce the weight of patient \nexperience/complaints and access measures to further align the Part C and Part D Quality Rating System with other CMS quality programs; \n\u2022Remove guardrails when \ndetermining measure-specific- thresholds for non-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures; \n\u2022Modify the hold harmless policy for \nthe Health Plan Quality Improvement and Drug Plan Quality Improvement measures; \n\u2022Add an additional basis for the \nsubregulatory removal of Star Ratings measures; and \n\u2022Remove the 60 percent rule for the \nadjustment for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (generally called the adjustment for disasters). \nFinally, we are also proposing a series \nof technical clarifications of the existing rules related to adjustments for disasters, QBP appeals processes, contract consolidations, and weighting of measures with a substantive specification change, as well as a technical amendment to \u00a7\u00a7 422.162(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) to fix a codification issue.

For example, as adopted in the April \n2018 final rule and used now, the measures from the CAHPS survey are based on the most recent data submitted from surveys of enrollees; the surveys ask about the experience of the enrollees over the last six months. The annual Medicare Part C & D Star Ratings Technical Notes (available online here: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/ Prescription-Drug-Coverage/ PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData) identify the measures and their data sources for each year\u2019s Star Ratings. \n182The measure, which has the HEDIS label \n\u2018\u2018Comprehensive Diabetes Care (CDC)\u2014Medical Attention for Nephropathy\u2019\u2019 was retired after the 2021 performance period as noted here https://www.ncqa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ Summary-Table-of-Changes-HEDIS-MY-2022.pdf and does not appear in the list for the 2022 performance period. discussed in section V.G. of this \nproposed rule and would be used in that context. \n\u2022Health equity index means an index \nthat summarizes contract performance among those with specified social risk factors (SRFs) across multiple measures into a single score. \nC. Contract Ratings (\u00a7\u00a7 422.162(b) and \n423.182(b)) \n1. Contract Type \nIn the April 2018 final rule (83 FR \n16440) at \u00a7\u00a7 422.162(b) and 423.182(b), \nwe codified the methodology for calculating the same overall and summary Star Ratings for all plan benefit packages (PBPs) offered under each MA-only, MA\u2013PD, or PDP contract. \nAs different organization or contract \ntypes offer different benefits, the overall and summary Star Ratings differ across contract types when the set of required measures differs. For example, non-SNP contracts do not submit the following measures and, therefore, their overall and Part C summary ratings do not include them: SNP Care Management, Care for Older Adults\u2014Medication Review, and Care for Older Adults\u2014 Pain Assessment. \nWe propose to amend \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.162(b)(1) and 423.182(b)(1) to add a sentence at the end to clarify that the overall and summary Star Ratings are calculated based on the measures required to be collected and reported for the contract type being offered for the Star Ratings year. This is our current practice and how the Star Ratings have historically been calculated. For example, the 2023 Star Ratings are calculated for the 2023 contract year using data primarily from measurement year 2021.\n181The 2023 Star Ratings are \npublished on Medicare Plan Finder in October 2022 to provide comparative \nquality performance information about plans for people with Medicare to use in making enrollment decisions for the 2023 calendar year. If a contract offered a SNP PBP in measurement year 2021, but is no longer offering a SNP PBP for the 2023 contract year, the 2023 Star Ratings exclude the SNP-only measures and the contract would be rated as \u2018\u2018Coordinated Care Plan without SNP\u2019\u2019. This is our current (and historical) \nprocess and how the proposed regulatory clarification will be applied. We welcome comments on this proposal. \n2. Contract Consolidations \nThe process for calculating measure \nscores for contracts that consolidate is \nspecified as a series of steps at \u00a7\u00a7 422.162(b)(3) and 423.182(b)(3). As described in the April 2018 final rule (83 FR 16528 through 16531), we use the enrollment-weighted means of the measure scores of the consumed and surviving contract(s) to calculate the measure-level ratings for the first and second years following the contract consolidation. For all contracts, under \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(f)(4) and 423.184(f)(4), the Part C and Part D improvement measures compare current contract-level measure scores with scores from the prior year across all measures included in the improvement measures calculations. Given there are no comparable prior year measure-level scores available for contracts in the first year of the consolidation, historically we have not calculated the Part C and D improvement measures for the first year after a consolidation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d65591b-7646-4fc3-943c-435ab780d563": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d65591b-7646-4fc3-943c-435ab780d563", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d44de30f-27cc-4656-aa4e-51a16c81f9f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4387f0368a1724fe06f62a77f09507e65695b99fd4532c8e67213be71be091e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "42f5d4aa-005d-4e6d-ad1d-18b5a84e21ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "93bfd72f06c642624c07f2ee3f5f2ef8607cf23db05df06dec290349a718d3ef"}}, "hash": "787b577efb734e8825d44ecd37a06ee69d744d09262cc55af83024d3c5775e02", "text": "We propose to amend \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.162(b)(3)(iv)(A)(1) and 423.182(b)(3)(ii)(A)(1) to clarify the calculation of the Part C and Part D improvement measures for contracts that consolidate. For the first year after a consolidation, we propose to clarify that the Part C and Part D improvement measures will not be calculated for the consolidated contract. The prior year measure-level scores only include data from the surviving contract; using those as the comparison point for a consolidated contract would not be an accurate comparison because it does not include any information about performance of the consumed \ncontract(s). For the second year after a consolidation, the improvement measure is calculated, using the enrollment-weighted measure scores for the current and prior year because scores for both years are available for the consolidated contract.

This proposal codifies our current application of the ratings rules. We welcome comments on this proposal. D. Adding, Updating, and Removing Measures (\u00a7\u00a7 422.164 and 423.184) \nThe regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164 and \n423.184 specify the criteria and procedure for adding, updating, and removing measures for the Star Ratings program. In the April 2018 final rule, at 83 FR 16532, we stated we are committed to continuing to improve the Part C and Part D Star Ratings system and anticipated that over time measures would be added, updated, and removed. We also specified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d) and 423.184(d) rules for measure updates based on whether they are substantive or non-substantive. The regulations, at paragraph (d)(1), list examples of non- substantive updates. See also 83 FR 16534\u201337. Due to the regular updates and revisions made to measures, CMS does not codify a list in regulation text of the measures (and their specifications) adopted for the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program (83 FR 16537). CMS lists the measures used for the Star Ratings each year in the Medicare Part C & D Star Ratings Technical Notes or similar guidance issued with publication of the Star Ratings. In this rule, CMS is proposing measure changes to the Star Ratings program for performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 unless noted otherwise. We are also proposing a new rule for the removal of measures and an additional example of a non-substantive measure update. \n1. Proposed Measure Removal \na.

We are proposing to replace this measure with the Kidney Health Evaluation for Patients with Diabetes measure (described in section V.D.3.a. of the preamble to this proposed rule). \nCMS is proposing to permanently \nremove the Diabetes Care\u2014Kidney Disease Monitoring measure starting with the 2024 Star Ratings because we will not have data to calculate the measure. \nb. Medication Reconciliation Post- \nDischarge (Part C) \nWe are proposing to remove the \nMedication Reconciliation Post- Discharge (MRP) measure as it would be duplicative of the MRP component of the Transitions of Care (TRC) measure to be included in the 2024 Star Ratings. In the January 2021 final rule at 86 FR 5921\u201324, CMS finalized inclusion of the TRC measure in the 2024 Star Ratings. The TRC measure includes four indicators: MRP, Notification of Inpatient Admission, Patient Engagement After Inpatient Discharge, and Receipt of Discharge Information. Currently, MRP appears in both the Medicare Part C and Part D Star Ratings as a stand-alone measure and on the Medicare Part C and D display page as one of the four indicators included in the TRC measure. As discussed at 86 FR 5921 through 5924, transitions from an inpatient stay back to home often result in poor care coordination, including communication gaps between inpatient and outpatient providers; planned and inadvertent medication changes; incomplete diagnostic work-ups; and insufficient understanding of diagnoses, medication, and follow-up care needs. The Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) also includes MRP\n183 \nwhich is one component of the TRC measure. Although at this time CMS is only implementing the TRC measure in the Part C Star Ratings program, it is a HEDIS measure and over time, it may be used in other programs. Based on the importance of care coordination in the Part C program and how the TRC measure provides a more comprehensive picture of how plans manage transitions across settings for care, we believe its inclusion in the Part C Star Ratings is appropriate. \nFor measurement year 2020, NCQA \nprovided multiple updates to the TRC measure as described at 86 FR 5921 and 5922. In one of these updates, NCQA revised the requirement of using one \nmedical record from a specific provider to, instead, allow numerator information to be captured from additional communication forms accessible to the primary care provider or ongoing care provider (for example, admissions, discharges, and transfers (ADT) feeds, shared electronic medical records (EMRs)) that occur regularly in the field and meet the intent of the measure. This change also ensured that scores for the MRP indicator in the TRC measure and the stand-alone MRP measure would match. Currently, the MRP measure for the Part C and Part D Star Ratings comes from the MRP indicator collected through the TRC measure. This is because NCQA decided that the stand- alone MRP measure no longer needed to be separately reported since it could be pulled from the medication reconciliation indicator in the TRC measure. \nCMS is proposing to remove the \nstand-alone MRP measure from the 2026 Star Ratings for measurement year 2024 since the same information about medication reconciliation is now also incorporated as a component of the TRC measure and, consequently, it is duplicative to have MRP as a stand- alone measure and as a component of the TRC measure. We welcome comments on this proposal. \n2. Proposed Measure Updates \nIn the April 2018 final rule, we \nspecified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d) and \n423.184(d) rules for measure updates based on whether they are substantive or non-substantive.

Where an update by the measure steward is substantive within the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d)(2) and 423.184(d)(2), CMS will initially solicit feedback on whether to make substantive measure updates through the process described for changes in and adoption of payment and risk adjustment policies in section 1853(b) of the Act and then engage in rulemaking to make substantive changes to a Star Ratings measure. Per \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d)(2) and 423.184(d)(2), CMS will place the updated measure on the display page for at least 2 years prior to using the updated measure to calculate and assign Star Ratings. This 2 year period for the updated measure to be on the display page may overlap with the period during which CMS solicits comment and engages in rulemaking. Further, the legacy measure may continue to be used in the Star Ratings during this period. a. Colorectal Cancer Screening (Part \nC)\u2014Substantive Change \nCMS is proposing a substantive \nupdate to the existing colorectal cancer screening measure because of changes in the applicable clinical guidance and by the measure steward. In May 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated guidance for the age at which colorectal cancer screenings should begin. Subsequently, NCQA, the measure steward, has updated its colorectal cancer screening measure to include a rate for adults 45\u2013 49 years of age for measurement year 2022. Therefore, CMS proposes expanding the age range for the Colorectal Cancer Screening measure to adults age 45\u201349, for an updated age range of 45\u201375, for the 2024 and subsequent measurement years. The expanded age range for this screening measure significantly increases the size of the population covered by this measure and is therefore a substantive measure specification change within the scope of \u00a7 422.164(d)(2). Other CMS programs, such as for the qualified health plans (QHPs)\n184and the adult \ncore set for Medicaid plans,185are \nplanning to introduce this change into their programs as they also use the same HEDIS measure. \nCMS solicited feedback on making \nthis substantive update to the measure in the Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies, and most commenters supported this change. As described in the April 2018 final rule (83 FR 16534), we may keep a legacy measure in the Star Ratings during the period that an updated version of the measure is on the display page. The legacy measure with the narrower age range of 50\u201375 years will remain available and be used in Star Ratings until the updated measure has been adopted through rulemaking and has been on the display page for 2 years. The updated measure will be on the display page for the 2024 Star Ratings, starting with the 2022 measurement year data. \nb.

Assessment measure back to the Star \nRatings after it has been on the display page following a substantive measure specification change. The COA measure is collected for Special Needs Plans (SNPs) and includes three indicators\u2014 Medication Review, Functional Status Assessment, and Pain Assessment. \nFor HEDIS 2021, based on the 2020 \nmeasurement year, NCQA implemented a change for the COA\u2014Functional Status Assessment. Previously the measure specification was that documentation of a complete functional status assessment must include: (1) notation that Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) were assessed; (2) notation that Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) were assessed; (3) result of assessment using a standardized functional assessment tool; or (4) notation that at least three of the following four components were assessed: (a) cognitive status, (b) ambulation status, (c) hearing, vision, and speech (that is, sensory ability), (d) other functional independence (for example, exercise, ability to perform job). Because the clinical field of functional status assessment was moving toward agreement on assessment using ADLs, IADLs, or another standardized tool, and to improve the clarity of the specification, NCQA removed the fourth option for meeting the numerator requirements for this indicator for HEDIS 2021. \nThe measure change for the COA\u2014 \nFunctional Status Assessment measure was considered substantive under \u00a7 422.164(d)(2) because removal of a mechanism for positive performance on the measure may meaningfully impact the numerator. The updated measure was moved to the display page starting with the 2022 Star Ratings. \nCMS is proposing to return this \nupdated measure to the Star Ratings, beginning with the 2026 Star Ratings and 2024 measurement period. With the updated specification, documentation of a complete functional status assessment must include: (1) notation that Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) were assessed; (2) notation that Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) were assessed; or (3) result of assessment using a standardized functional assessment tool. For weighting purposes, a substantively updated \nmeasure is treated as a new measure, and as described at \u00a7 422.166(e)(2), will receive a weight of 1 for the first year in the Star Ratings; this treatment of substantively updated measures as new measures for purposes of weighting was addressed in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 5919) and is proposed to be more clearly addressed in \u00a7 422.166(e)(2) in section V.E.2 of this proposed rule. \nTherefore, this measure will receive a weight of 1 for its first year and will be treated as a process measure in subsequent years. \nc. Medication Adherence for Diabetes \nMedication, Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists), Medication Adherence for Cholesterol \n(Statins) (Part D)\u2014Substantive Change \nCMS proposes to implement risk \nadjustment (also sometimes referred to as case-mix adjustment) based on sociodemographic status (SDS) characteristics, a substantive update, to the three Part D medication adherence measures for the 2028 Star Ratings (2026 measurement year). Health outcomes are affected by patient-related and external factors such as existing clinical conditions and SDS. Currently, the medication adherence measures (Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cholesterol) are included in the determination of the Star Ratings Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI) because they are not excluded by the criteria established in \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(2) and 423.186(f)(2); for example, the measures are not case-mix adjusted for socioeconomic status. The CAI was implemented in the 2017 Star Ratings to adjust for average within-contract disparity in performance associated with the percentages of beneficiaries who receive low income subsidy and/or dual eligible (LIS/DE) and/or have disability status. The CAI was initially developed as an interim analytical adjustment to address concerns about disparities while longer-term solutions were explored, including engaging with measure stewards to examine if re- specification is warranted for measures used in the Star Ratings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6714e4d8-3399-4e83-a159-a3fa9deed720": {"__data__": {"id_": "6714e4d8-3399-4e83-a159-a3fa9deed720", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5eda052-d92f-43bc-be6e-9d315216805b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e9cbb621aac6e10a3aae80e45de2a6b0a31126af287d5f01a856d4ca94ab74b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "713f99dc-c451-46f5-9394-74a7b9594914", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a8a40d938cef592d27cae83510224e47bfd6269de97a1e2d0f733d66ff9c5d07"}}, "hash": "8058d071aa139a2457062c535bbd9ebef95e80877ea1c034e24e1e09ff5b2254", "text": "The methodology for the CAI was codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(2) and 423.186(f)(2); the factor is calculated as the mean difference in the adjusted and unadjusted ratings (overall, Part D for MA\u2013PDs, and Part D for PDPs) of the contracts that lie within each final adjustment category for each rating type. \nIn addition, the National Quality \nForum (NQF) convened an expert panel in 2014 and recommended that performance-based measures should be risk adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES) and other socio demographic factors in 2017. On June 28, 2020, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) submitted a second Report to Congress;\n186ASPE is required under section 2(d) of the Improving Medicare \nPost-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) to study the effects of certain social risk factors of Medicare beneficiaries on quality measures and measures of resource use in Medicare value-based purchasing programs. \nCMS contracted with the Pharmacy \nQuality Alliance (PQA), the steward of these measures, to examine the medication adherence measures for potential risk adjustment. PQA recommended sociodemographic status (SDS) risk adjustment for the Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medication, Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists), and Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Statins) measures. PQA recommended and endorsed the following changes related to SDS in their Measure Manual: \n\u2022All three adherence measures \nshould be risk adjusted for SDS characteristics to adequately reflect differences in patient populations. \n\u2022The measures should be adjusted \nfor the following beneficiary-level SDS characteristics: age, gender, dual \neligibility/low-income subsidy (LIS) status, and disability status. \n\u2022The measures should be stratified \nby these four beneficiary-level SDS characteristics (listed in the prior bullet) to allow health plans to identify disparities and understand how their patient population mix is affecting their measure rates. \nThe PQA measure specifications were \nendorsed by NQF in the 2019 Spring cycle (NQF endorsed #0541). \nCMS has included stratifications by \nage, gender, dual eligibility/LIS status, and disability status in the Medication Adherence patient safety reports to Part D sponsors beginning with the 2019 measurement year. \nWe are proposing to implement risk \nadjustment for the medication adherence measures based on the PQA specifications, which would be reflected in the Star Ratings. Additionally, because the medication adherence measures will be risk adjusted based on SDS characteristics (that is, for age, gender, dual eligibility/LIS, and disability status), the medication adherence measures will be excluded from the CAI adjustment per \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(2)(ii)(A) and 423.186(f)(2)(ii)(A).

We calculated SDS risk adjusted medication adherence measure rates using year of service (YOS) 2019 measurement year data and recalculated the CAI values excluding these three adherence measures. We then recalculated the overall and Part D summary ratings using the SDS risk adjusted medication adherence measure rates, revised CAI values, the final 2021 Star Ratings for other measures, and the reward factor. In our analysis, we found that the threshold shifts for measure- level cut points with SDS risk adjustment were minimal for both MA\u2013 PD and PDP contracts, ranging from \u20132 to +1 percentage point(s) for MA\u2013PD contracts and about \u20132 to +3 percentage points for PDP contracts. We found that for both MA\u2013PD and PDP contracts, approximately 60\u201370 percent of contracts retained the same star level across the Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists) and Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Statins) measures. When a star level shift was observed, most of the MA\u2013PD and PDP contracts shifted by one-star level and usually shifted upwards when the SDS risk adjustment was applied to the adherence measures. One percent of MA\u2013PD contracts shifted two-star levels for the Medication Adherence for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists) and Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Stains) measures. The two-star level shifts were primarily upwards, but one contract did shift down two stars in the Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (Stains) measure. For the Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medication measure, 82 percent of MA\u2013PD contracts and 59 percent of PDP contracts retained the same star level. When a star level shift was observed for the Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medications measure, most MA\u2013PD and PDP contracts saw a one-star downward movement with the SDS risk adjustment applied to the measure. \nAs previously noted, if CMS \nimplements SDS risk adjustment for the three medication adherence measures, the measures would no longer be included in determining the Star Ratings CAI. Therefore, we also conducted an analysis to simulate calculating the CAI values without case- \nmix adjusting the three adherence measures for LIS/DE and disability; these simulated CAI values were used in \nthe application of the simulated summary rating calculations. For most MA\u2013PD contracts, this resulted in a negative shift in the CAI adjustment values for the overall and Part D summary ratings, and in contrast, most PDPs had a positive shift in values. Additionally, the analysis found a minimal change in reward factor thresholds, ranging from \u20130.07 to +0.02 for mean percentile thresholds and \u20130.08 to +0.008 for variance percentile thresholds. In the analysis of the overall and Part D summary rating, 91 percent of MA\u2013PD contracts retained the same overall rating, 7 percent decreased by half a star, and 2 percent increased by half a star. We found that 81 percent of MA\u2013PD contracts retained the same Part D summary rating, 11 percent decreased by half a star, and 7 percent increased by half a star. The impact on PDP contracts was neutral or positive; 63 percent of PDP contracts retained the same Part D summary rating star level while 37 percent increased by a half a star. No PDP contracts had a decrease in their Part D summary rating. \nThe Part C and Part D improvement \nmeasures were not recalculated for this simulation. The final 2021 Star Ratings for both improvement measures were used for the summary rating recalculations in the simulations to illustrate the impact of this proposed change to the three medication adherence measures. Additionally, the final 2020 Star Ratings for both improvement measures and for the three adherence measures were used for the CAI value recalculations in the simulations. It is possible that the simulated differences could vary if or when we are able to have two consecutive years of adjusted data for recalculating these components. \nPer \u00a7 423.184(d)(2), the change to \nimplement SDS risk adjustment for the three Part D medication adherence measures would be a substantive update.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83079a88-f7f8-4027-82f1-87ca7052355e": {"__data__": {"id_": "83079a88-f7f8-4027-82f1-87ca7052355e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1eb3a239-db20-46a0-9383-452a8b1c8dc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "887369e6a26b767a7be1b21189a08baffab1ec2cbe8279df0499ae7edd19e825"}, "2": {"node_id": "7413099e-b3b0-4ee9-a5e5-dfac1e8966c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b48e9a349a8d6e3ed630051a5c7737cc3f28f99d80d305e3a9a43e669a584c8b"}}, "hash": "05a2983fda12e9fe856a544d12a3bf7cd9577a250a98e27743ad17df19714e86", "text": "We signaled this potential update and solicited initial feedback on incorporating the SDS risk adjustment in the Advance Notice and Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) 2023 Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies.

However, implementing these non-substantive updates is not dependent on finalizing the SDS risk adjustment proposal and will be included in the Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) 2024 Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies. These specification changes are non- substantive in accordance with \u00a7 423.184(d)(1) because they narrow the denominator population or do not change the target population or intent of the measure: (1) apply continuous \nenrollment (CE) instead of member- years (MYs) adjustment and (2) no longer adjust for stays in inpatient (IP) settings and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). \nCurrently, the Part D enrollment used \nby CMS in the medication adherence measures is adjusted monthly based on MYs to account for beneficiaries who are enrolled for only part of the contract year enrollment (for example, if a beneficiary is enrolled in the Part D contract for 6 out of 12 months of the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00167 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "882db761-eb14-4bd5-9799-bcf1818fc745": {"__data__": {"id_": "882db761-eb14-4bd5-9799-bcf1818fc745", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af738a29-b9ea-44e6-9038-aaeb2b222a17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "faa85717ea1eac65ab44f907a9e353c9061583795d7799616b9cb814c888daf6"}, "3": {"node_id": "c770b6c3-8bd4-42d6-a9a7-a0b2fe1a9502", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cc4530de06ff111daf51ed2d8a731505d60cd6536a8c87e058c1d3168942bce7"}}, "hash": "dd94f718bf45ebc5b902a88decf9b6de312cdcae1c2a6999935deb1daef9aaa4", "text": "79618 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nyear, the beneficiary will count only as \n0.5 member-years in the rate calculation). Moving forward when applying the SDS risk adjustment for the medication adherence measures, CMS intends to discontinue the use of MY of enrollment, which is a non-substantive update. Rather, we intend to align with PQA measure specifications of CE as defined by the treatment period and exclude beneficiaries with more than 1- day gap in enrollment during the treatment period. \nAccording to the current PQA \nmeasure specifications, the treatment period begins on the earliest date of service for a target medication during the measurement year which is the index prescription start date (IPSD) and extends through whichever comes first: the last day of the enrollment during the measurement year, death, or end of the measurement year. The treatment period should be at least 91 days. Therefore, a beneficiary may meet the requirements of enrollment in more than one contract in a measurement year but partial enrollment during the measurement year will no longer be adjusted using MYs methodology; this beneficiary may be eligible to be included in the measure calculation if continuously enrolled in one contract even if the beneficiary disenrolls from the contract prior to the end of the measurement year and enrolls into a different contract based on the PQA definition of CE. To clarify, per the current PQA measure specifications of treatment period, beneficiaries can have only one treatment period per contract\u2014meaning if a beneficiary disenrolls after the IPSD and then re- enrolls (in the same Part D plan) in the same contract during the same measurement year, the beneficiary would not be included in the measure calculation for that particular contract if there is more than a one day gap in enrollment during the treatment period. If a beneficiary is enrolled in a Part D plan offered under one contract but then disenrolls and enrolls into a Part D plan offered under another (that is, different) contract and subsequently the beneficiary meets the measure criteria for one or both contracts, the beneficiary will be included in the measure rate calculation for all the applicable contract(s). The beneficiary partial enrollment would no longer be adjusted for partial MY enrollment (for example, 0.5) which accounts for a fraction of the beneficiary\u2019s enrollment in a contract but would now be calculated as 1 for rate calculation purposes under the CE methodology. CMS conducted an analysis of beneficiaries who met CE in the same contract using the YOS 2019 Patient Safety reports. Approximately \n95 percent of beneficiaries met the definition for being continuously enrolled for the Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medications measure and about 96 percent for the Medication Adherence for Hypertension Medications (RAS Antagonists) and Medication Adherence for Cholesterol Medications (Statins) measures. \nUsing YOS 2019 data, CMS analyzed \nthe impact of implementing both the proposed SDS risk adjustment and the use of the current PQA measure specification definition of CE (instead of MY) for the three medication adherence measures. The analysis was limited to Part D contracts that were included in the 2021 Star Ratings for comparison purposes. Based on our analysis, we found that most MA\u2013PD contract measure rates remained the same after the SDS risk adjustment and CE updates were applied. The change in distribution of rates among MA\u2013PDs was negligible (at most 1 percentage point difference on average) between the current MY methodology and the SDS risk adjustment with CE methodology for all three medication adherence measures. Similarly, for PDPs, the change in distribution of rates among PDPs was minimal (at most 1 to 2 percentage point difference on average). \nCurrently, we also adjust for Part D \nbeneficiaries\u2019 stays in IP settings and SNFs. However, CMS plans to make a non-substantive change to discontinue adjusting for SNF and IP stays in calculating these measures. Our overall goal in making these non-substantive changes to the adherence measures is to fully align with current PQA measure specifications endorsed by the NQF; the PQA specifications do not include IP/ SNF stay adjustments in the adherence measures. In addition, during our testing of both this adjustment and the SDS risk adjustment, we found that applying IP and SNF stay adjustments added a level of complexity and concerns about the accuracy of the SDS risk adjustment. \nIn our analysis of comparing SDS \nadjusted rates with and without IP/SNF stays, the impact of the IP/SNF stay adjustment had very minimal impact to the distribution of measure rates for all three adherence measures for MA\u2013PDs and PDPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c770b6c3-8bd4-42d6-a9a7-a0b2fe1a9502": {"__data__": {"id_": "c770b6c3-8bd4-42d6-a9a7-a0b2fe1a9502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af738a29-b9ea-44e6-9038-aaeb2b222a17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "faa85717ea1eac65ab44f907a9e353c9061583795d7799616b9cb814c888daf6"}, "2": {"node_id": "882db761-eb14-4bd5-9799-bcf1818fc745", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dd94f718bf45ebc5b902a88decf9b6de312cdcae1c2a6999935deb1daef9aaa4"}}, "hash": "cc4530de06ff111daf51ed2d8a731505d60cd6536a8c87e058c1d3168942bce7", "text": "For the Medication \nAdherence for Diabetes measure, the mean rates remained the same for both MA\u2013PDs (85 percent) and PDPs (84 percent) regardless of whether the IP/ SNF stay adjustment was included or not.

Proposed Measure Additions \nWe are committed to continuing to \nimprove the Part C and Part D Star \nRatings system by focusing on improving clinical and other health outcomes. Consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(c)(1) and 423.184(c)(1), we continue to review measures that are nationally endorsed and in alignment with the private sector. 83 FR 16521, 16533. For example, we regularly review measures developed by NCQA and PQA. CMS is proposing to adopt the new measures described in this rule, which are measures developed by NCQA or PQA. The Kidney Health Evaluation for Patients with Diabetes measure has been collected since 2020 measurement year and the new Part D measures are calculated from prescription drug event or CMS administrative data so they do not require any new data collections. \na. Kidney Health Evaluation for Patients \nWith Diabetes (Part C) \nWe propose to add the Kidney Health \nEvaluation for Patients with Diabetes (KED) measure to the 2026 Star Ratings. This measure was introduced as a HEDIS measure for the 2020 measurement year.

This new measure aligns with recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and provides critical information for screening and monitoring of kidney health for patients with diabetes. This measure would replace the prior related measure, Diabetes Care\u2014Kidney Disease Monitoring. \nCMS began reporting this measure on \nthe display page for the 2022 Star Ratings. As provided at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164 (c)(3) and (4) and 423.184(c)(3) and (4) (83 FR 16534), as new performance measures are developed and adopted they are initially posted on the display page for at least 2 years. \nWe have submitted the KED plan \nmeasure through the 2022 Measures Under Consideration process for review by the Measures Application Partnership, which is a multi- stakeholder partnership that provides recommendations to HHS on the selection of quality and efficiency measures for CMS programs. The MIPS program has also submitted it to the 2021 Measures Under Consideration process and this measure will also be implemented for QHPs.\n188 \nWe propose to add the KED measure \nto the 2026 Star Ratings. \nb. Concurrent Use of Opioids and \nBenzodiazepines (COB), Polypharmacy Use of Multiple Anticholinergic Medications in Older Adults (Poly- ACH), and Polypharmacy Use of Multiple Central Nervous System Active Medications in Older Adults (Poly-CNS) (Part D) \nCMS proposes to add the following \nmeasures to the 2026 Star Ratings (2024 measurement year): COB, Poly-ACH, and Poly-CNS. Additionally, the measures will include a non-substantive update: to align with the PQA measure specifications by using continuous enrollment (CE) and no longer adjusting for member-years (MYs). CMS has reported the following three Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) measures for the Part D program on the 2021 display page (using 2019 data) and 2022 display page (using 2020 data) on www.cms.gov as \nannounced in the Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) 2020 Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and Part D Payment Policies and Final Call Letter. These measures reflect the following \nperformance: \n\u2022Concurrent Use of Opioids and \nBenzodiazepines (COB) (Part D)\u2014 analyzes the percentage of Medicare Part D beneficiaries 18 years and older with concurrent use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines. \n\u2022Polypharmacy Use of Multiple \nAnticholinergic Medications in Older Adults (Poly-ACH) (Part D)\u2014analyzes the percentage of Medicare Part D beneficiaries, 65 years or older, with concurrent use of two or more unique ACH medications during the measurement period.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddf6f582-9e0a-42d3-9b64-dfeff9666c4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddf6f582-9e0a-42d3-9b64-dfeff9666c4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7555b3c-040a-460a-8588-29b53e2cb0a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "112a245aca2ff8dd3290b01e7d5ef85bbfe99258377bf4c41ea05bbe35051c02"}, "2": {"node_id": "21f82472-0920-490f-9fdf-b76db4f483e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5974886a563cecff1152d326682b1fff373380a98b6f83e163fe295f35770a1d"}}, "hash": "94ade3df84aa0c57165c257c088807ed27912781e200822b7c259860e7bad09c", "text": "\u2022Polypharmacy Use of Multiple \nCentral Nervous System-Active Medications in Older Adults (Poly-CNS) (Part D)\u2014analyzes the percentage of Medicare Part D beneficiaries, 65 years or older, with concurrent use of three or more unique CNS-active medications during the measurement period. \nThese are important areas of focus for \nthe Medicare Part D population. Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines can increase the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdoses.\n189 190 In addition, concurrent \nuse of two or more unique anticholinergic medications in older adults was associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, and the concurrent use of three or more unique CNS active medications in older adults was associated with increased risk of falls and fractures.\n191Therefore, we \ninitially monitored these measures starting with the 2021 display page (2019 measurement year) and now propose to transition them to the Star Ratings. We anticipate that the COB, Poly-ACH, and Poly-CNS measures will continue to help plans identify enrollees who are at risk of respiratory depression or fatal overdoses, cognitive decline, or falls and fractures, respectively, and facilitate plans to encourage appropriate prescribing when clinically necessary. \nWe observed that the overall rates for \nthe COB measure have slightly improved from 2021 to 2022 display page for both MA\u2013PD and PDP contracts from 17 percent to 16 percent. For the Poly-CNS measure, MA\u2013PD and PDP \ncontract rates remained the same at 6 percent. Lastly in the Poly-ACH measure, we found that the MA\u2013PD and PDP contract rates slightly increased from 8 percent to 9 percent. There is room for further improvement for all three measures. Per \u00a7\u00a7 423.184(c)(3) and (4), new Part D measures added to the Star Ratings program must be on the display page for a minimum of 2 years prior to becoming a Star Ratings measure. In addition, the measures, as previously discussed, were submitted through the 2021 Measures Under Consideration (MUC) process, a pre- rulemaking process for the selection of quality and efficiency measures under section 1890A of the Act. These measures were reviewed by the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) for input and recommendations to HHS on measure selection for CMS programs. All three measures received conditional approval. \nWe propose to add the COB, Poly- \nACH, and Poly-CNS measures for the 2026 Star Ratings (based on 2024 measurement year). We will also align these three measures with the PQA measure specifications to use continuous enrollment (CE) and no longer adjust for member-years (MYs) to account for beneficiaries who are enrolled for only part of the contract year. On the display page, these three measures currently use the MY methodology; however, when the measures are transitioned to Star Ratings, the measures will not be calculated based on MY adjustment but will be calculated based on CE measure specifications defined by PQA. Based on the 2022 PQA Measure Manual, the beneficiary\u2019s index prescription start date (IPSD) begins on the earliest date of service for an opioid, ACH, or CNS- active medication, respectively, during the measurement year. Beneficiaries are continuously enrolled during the measurement year with one allowable gap of up to 31 days in enrollment during the measurement year. The change to use CE for these measures, compared to the measures as they have been used for the display page since 2021 with the MY adjustment, would be a non-substantive update under \u00a7 423.184(d)(1) because the updates do not modify the intent of the measure or the target population but may narrow the denominator population. We described these non-substantive updates here to provide complete information on the measures we propose to add to the Star Ratings and will describe the non- substantive updates in the Announcement of Calendar Year (CY) \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00169 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de51d15f-4119-496f-9109-0d7c99687210": {"__data__": {"id_": "de51d15f-4119-496f-9109-0d7c99687210", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb6b8509-fae8-4e94-bdb5-bd1102f9bcb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c8fb16bff1e079550b3db4846e5cf39c1555019b021ffcad4ab1f79c5a901684"}}, "hash": "c8fb16bff1e079550b3db4846e5cf39c1555019b021ffcad4ab1f79c5a901684", "text": "79620 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n2024 Medicare Advantage (MA) \nCapitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies as required by \u00a7 423.184(d)(1). \nWe solicit comments on adding the \nthree Part D measures to the Star Ratings. \nTable 4 summarizes the additional \nand updated measures addressed in this proposed rule for the 2026 Star Ratings, unless otherwise noted.

Revising the Rule for Non-Substantive \nMeasure Updates (\u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d) and 423.184(d)) \nWe are proposing to add collection of \nsurvey data through another mode of survey administration to the non- exhaustive list of non-substantive measure updates that can be made without rulemaking. The rules CMS adopted to address measure updates based on whether an update is substantive or non-substantive are specified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d) and 423.184(d). As described at 83 FR 16534, we incorporate updates without rulemaking for measure specification changes that do not substantively change the nature of the measure. In paragraphs (d)(1)(i)\u2013(v) of \u00a7\u00a7 422.164 and 423.184, we provided a non- exhaustive list of circumstances that \nwould constitute a non-substantive update. Currently, paragraph (d)(1)(v) of each regulation identifies the addition of an alternative data source as a non- substantive update; the proposed additional example is the collection of alternative data sources or expansion of modes of data collection. These two \nexamples are similar but not exactly the same, so we are proposing to clarify in the regulation that an expansion in the data sources used, whether by adding an alternative source of data or adding an alternative way to collect the data, is a non-substantive change in measure specifications. The expansion of how data are collected is non-substantive because there would be no change to the information that is being collected; the only change would be the way in which it is collected. For example, if a web mode of survey administration is added to the current mail with telephone follow-up of non-respondents survey administration that is currently used for CAHPS and HOS, this would be \nconsidered a non-substantive change that could be announced through the process described for changes in and adoption of payment and risk adjustment policies in section 1853(b) of the Act since this does not change what is being measured, but just expands the way the data can be collected. \nWe propose to revise the regulation \ntext at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(d)(1)(v) and 423.184(d)(1)(v) by adding that another example of a non-substantive change would include a new mode of data collection. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \n5. Measure Removal (\u00a7\u00a7 422.164(e)(1) \nand 423.184(e)(1)) \nCMS proposes adding a new rule for \nmeasure removal. We propose that CMS will have the authority to remove a measure from calculations of Star Ratings when a measure steward other than CMS retires the measure. CMS continually reviews measures that are used in calculations of Star Ratings. As codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(e)(1) and 423.184(e)(1), CMS may remove a measure (1) when the clinical guidelines associated with the specifications of the measure change such that the specifications are no longer believed to align with positive health outcomes, or (2) when a measure shows low statistical reliability. See also 83 FR 16533\u201316537.

We propose that when a measure steward other than CMS (for example, NCQA or PQA) retires a measure, CMS will have the authority to remove the measure from calculations of Star Ratings through the process described at \u00a7\u00a7 422.164(e)(2) and 423.184(e)(2). When a measure steward such as NCQA retires a measure, they go through a process that includes extensive review by their various measurement panels and they solicit public comment regarding proposed measure retirements so health plans, purchasers, consumers and other stakeholders have an opportunity to weigh in on the relevance and scientific soundness of any changes to the HEDIS measurement set. This proposal will allow CMS to respond more quickly to measure removals by external measure stewards to ensure that measures included in Star Ratings are clinically meaningful, reliable, and up-to-date. We solicit comment on this proposal. \nE. Measure Weights (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(e) and \n423.186(e)) \n1. Patient Experience/Complaints and \nAccess Measures (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(e)(1)(iii) and (iv), 423.186(e)(1)(iii) and (iv)) \nCMS is proposing to lower the weight \nof patient experience/complaints and access measures to 2 beginning with the 2026 Star Ratings covering the 2024 measurement period. The weight for the patient experience/complaints and access measures is codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(e)(1)(iii) and (iv) and 423.186(e)(1)(iii) and (iv). Process measures receive a weight of 1, outcome measures receive a weight of 3, and the Part C and D Improvement measures receive a weight of 5. In the April 2018 final rule, we finalized an increase in the weight of patient experience/ complaints and access measures from 1.5 to 2, starting with the 2021 Star Ratings. (83 FR 16575\u201377). These measures include the patient experience of care measures collected through the CAHPS survey, Members Choosing to Leave the Plan, Appeals, Call Center, and Complaints measures. We also stated in the April 2018 final rule (83 FR 16575\u201316576) that, given the importance of hearing the voice of patients when evaluating the quality of care provided, CMS intended to further increase the weight of patient experience/complaints and access measures in the future. In the June 2020 final rule, CMS finalized an additional increase in the weight of patient experience/complaints and access measures from 2 to 4 for the 2023 Star Ratings. At that time, we said we were putting more weight on this category of measures that primarily reflect patient experience of care measures to put patients first and to emphasize CMS\u2019s goal of listening to the voice of the patient to identify opportunities to improve care delivery. (85 FR 33837) We still believe these measures focus on critical aspects of care such as care coordination and access to care from the perspective of enrollees, but taking into consideration additional stakeholder feedback we have received and the effect of the policy on the 2023 Star Ratings, we have reconsidered our position from the June 2020 final rule and now believe these measures currently receive an undue weight in the Star Ratings program.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eddb1c7-6bad-4e89-ac7c-16e48766a72d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eddb1c7-6bad-4e89-ac7c-16e48766a72d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "788884d9-11b3-4b7e-b6fa-a6b9d40fed75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e1fe21fee4492adad8e1146aaaaacd0a7d0703682e3fa582b9363f9e3dff7f80"}, "2": {"node_id": "41f28269-aa1a-4c5e-9b45-ba315ed551d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8d9f8ac7706c7f904fec94ca2cb695a5577f36545ce834b97aa5cbdad32276ba"}}, "hash": "933849e9ed86159cb6f5a91c24af1f9d685aaae1dad62603f31fda4927218e66", "text": "One of the guiding principles of the \nPart C and Part D Star Ratings program is to align with the CMS Quality Strategy (83 FR 16521). As part of the current CMS Quality Strategy, CMS is trying to create a resilient, high-value health care system that promotes quality outcomes, safety, equity, and accessibility for all individuals, as described at https://www.cms.gov/ Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient- Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based- Programs/CMS-Quality-Strategy. One of \nthe goals of the CMS Quality Strategy is to increase alignment across the CMS quality programs to improve value. Currently, the measure weight of 4 for the patient experience/complaints and access measures is not consistent with the contribution of these types of measures in the overall performance scores for other CMS quality measurement programs. For example, in the hospital value-based purchasing program, person and community engagement measures which are measures collected through the Hospital CAHPS Survey account for 25 percent of the total performance score for hospitals (https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality- initiatives-patient-assessment- instruments/hospitalqualityinits/ hospital-value-based-purchasing-). As another example, one-sixth of the global score for the Quality Rating System for QHPs is based on enrollee experience (https://www.cms.gov/files/document/ 2022-qrs-and-qhp-enrollee-survey- technical-guidance.pdf). In contrast, for the 2023 Star Ratings, with a weight of 4, the patient experience/complaints and access measures account for approximately 58 percent of the overall rating for MA\u2013PDs. For the Part C and Part D Star Ratings, we include a \nbroader set of measures related to person and community engagement relative to other CMS quality programs. For example, we include appeals measures given the importance of access to care and services for Part C plan enrollees. However, if the patient experience/complaints and access measures had a weight of 2, these measures would account for 41 percent of the overall rating. Reducing the weighting to 2 for this category of measures would align the patient experience/complaints and access measures more closely with other programs, without exactly matching the lower influence measures of this type have on the overall (that is, total performance or global) score in these other programs. We are not proposing to reduce the weight further than 2 given the important link between patient \nexperience, adherence, and health outcomes. Reducing the weight for these measures from 4 to 2 is a significant change and a more extensive change may be too much to adopt at this time. Prior to the April 2018 final rule, the weight of 1.5 given to the patient experience/complaints and access measures in the Part C and Part D Stars Ratings had been in place since the 2012 Star Ratings, so we have extensive experience with how using a weight lower than 2 for these categories of measures influence plan behavior. We continue to believe that a weight higher than 1.5 is appropriate. \nThe weighting of measures within the \nStar Ratings program is important as not all measures contribute equally to the goals of the program. Patient experience, complaints, and access to care have been linked to improved clinical outcomes and are important aspects of health care. For example, patient experience is associated with better patient adherence to recommended treatment, better clinical processes, better hospital patient safety culture, better clinical outcomes, reduced unnecessary health care use, and fewer inpatient complications (Anhang Price et al., 2014; Anhang Price et al., 2015; Quigley et al., 2021).\n192We also \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00173 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd9bdc64-d875-4152-aa5a-1336391d4e4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd9bdc64-d875-4152-aa5a-1336391d4e4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "119f2b3f-7ae1-44ba-8f28-55470791cef7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f03d55ba581d98362def9b94a08b1caf81b89e6d6b0e65296dfaf489f56d83f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "09a99b73-4ffc-439f-b379-ba3de9a0d6ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ca273473b0969d7df199dbb3cbdd0ccc3688c65ddade06ac0242204dabbea70d"}}, "hash": "8b35492ece03d7dcb6c9fc5f10dd2d8d0f0543313ea8aec985ccadd4d1cdea09", "text": "79624 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \npatient experience: a systematic review.

Health Affairs Forefront. recognize that whether clinicians \nacknowledge patient preferences193 \nmay be another factor that is important to measure and include in the Star Ratings program; consequently, we are currently testing a question for the CAHPS survey related to whether an enrollee\u2019s personal doctor dismisses symptoms that are important to them for potential incorporation in the survey and Star Ratings in the future. CMS continues to believe, as we stated in the April 2018 final rule at 83 FR 16576, that we must listen to the perceptions of care from people with Medicare, as well as ensure they have access to needed care. While focusing on patient experiences of care and ensuring that care is person-centric are critical, health and drug plans also have a responsibility to consider and work toward improving clinical outcomes. Improving clinical outcomes is an important goal for the Part C and Part D programs to meet the CMS Quality Strategy goal of promoting the highest quality outcomes and safest care for all individuals. High-value care does not always align with patient experiences of care, and we must take this into consideration as we consider how to weight the different Star Ratings measures. Clinical quality measures, for example, are also important in that they measure health outcomes, clinical processes and adherence to clinical guidelines. They measure whether plans are following the best practices for healthcare delivery, including providing preventive care such as immunizations and cancer screenings and caring for enrollees with ongoing health problems such as diabetic enrollees who need blood sugar tests, eye exams and blood pressure monitoring. It is also important to create incentives for health and drug plans to continuously focus on quality improvement by giving sufficient weight to the Health Plan Quality Improvement and Drug Plan Quality Improvement measures relative to the patient experience/access and complaints measures. We believe the weight given to measures in the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program should be in line with the how the measures are linked to health care and the value they have in improving health care. \nSubsequent to finalizing the weight of \n4 for patient experience/complaints and access measures in the June 2020 final rule, we have received significant stakeholder feedback on this issue through the Part C and D Advance \nNotices, the 2023 Part C and D proposed rule (CMS\u20134192\u2013P), the COVID\u201319 interim final rules (CMS\u20131744\u2013IFC and CMS 3401\u2013IFC), letters sent to CMS and meetings with plans. A number of concerns have been raised by stakeholders related to a weight of 4, including devaluing measures of health outcomes, encouraging plans to abandon efforts to drive clinically appropriate care, sending the message that preventive care such as cancer screenings are not important, and not balancing appropriately clinical excellence and patient experience. Stakeholders have also raised concerns around disproportionately overweighting patient experience measures which in turn diminishes the importance of other measures. MedPAC noted in their response to the CY 2021 and 2022 proposed rule (CMS\u20134190\u2013P) that the increased weight would give disproportionate weight to patient experience measures relative to outcome measures and create an imbalance between the two most important measure groupings\u2014outcome and patient experience measures. Stakeholders have continued to raise concerns about the disproportionate weight given to patient experience/ complaints and access measures. Stakeholders have continued to suggest that clinical outcomes should count more than patient experience of care measures. Additionally, we have received feedback that cancer screenings, medication reconciliation, and other Star Ratings measures are critical areas of focus in particular in underserved communities but have a diminished role in the Star Ratings program due to the high weight of patient experience/complaints and access measures. \nGiven these concerns, as well as the \nimpact of the weighting policy on the 2023 Star Ratings, CMS is re-evaluating its decision to weight these measures higher than outcome measures. We are concerned that the higher weight of 4 may create incentives for plans to not focus as much on patient outcomes, screenings, and preventive care.

In addition, we are proposing to revise the heading for paragraph (e)(2) to reflect how the provision addresses the weight of both new and substantively updated measures. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \nF. Guardrails (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and \n423.186(a)(2)(i)) \nIn the April 2019 final rule, we \namended \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) by adding guardrails, which are measure-specific caps to Star Ratings cut points in both directions so that the measure-threshold-specific cut points do not increase or decrease more than the value of the cap from one year to the next. The intent of this change in methodology was to increase the predictability and stability of cut points. As described in the April 2019 final rule at 84 FR 15754, a trade-off of increasing the predictability of cut points is the inability to keep pace with any unanticipated changes in industry performance. Based on recent experience with calculating Star Ratings during the COVID\u201319 PHE and analyses of the data for the 2022 Star Ratings, we are proposing to modify the current hierarchical clustering methodology that is used to set cut points for non-CAHPS measure stars at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) by eliminating the guardrails that restrict the maximum allowable movement of non-CAHPS measure cut points. \nWhen we initially proposed \nguardrails so that the cut points for non- CAHPS measures do not increase or \ndecrease more than the cap from one year to the next, we recognized that with guardrails there may be an inability for thresholds to fully keep pace with changes in performance across the industry. A cap on upward movement can inflate the measure-level Star Ratings if true improvements in performance cannot be fully incorporated in the current year\u2019s ratings. If overall industry performance shifts upward on a measure, the Star Ratings cut points affected by a cap for that measure may not fully take into account this upward shift in industry performance. While we recognized the possibility at the time we finalized the guardrails policy, we now have evidence from the 2022 and 2023 Star Ratings that shows that unintended \nconsequence of the policy. For example, for the 2023 Star Ratings for Part C Osteoporosis Management in Women who had a Fracture, the four star threshold without the cap was greater than or equal to 60 percent, but this threshold was reduced to greater than or \nequal to 55 percent when guardrails were applied. In effect, the cap makes it easier for contracts to receive four stars than it would have been if there was no cap. In this example, because of the cap, a contract with performance of 57 percent would receive a four star rating when, without the cap, the contract would receive a three star rating. This is diluting the value of receiving four stars for contracts that would have received four stars without the cap since some contracts received four stars for performance that ordinarily would not qualify for four stars. Conversely, a cap on downward movement can decrease the measure-level Star Ratings when industry performance overall shifts downward, since the ratings cannot be adjusted fully for downward shifts in performance. For example, for the 2023 Star Ratings for Colorectal Cancer Screening, the one star cut point was higher (43 percent) than it would have been without a cap (38 percent), and therefore more contracts received a one star rating on that measure than they would have if there were no cap.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7022273c-2490-4f33-b979-d98ad734910d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7022273c-2490-4f33-b979-d98ad734910d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd997b72-f541-44fa-a842-78b4f0762902", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b4e97a6b9e8a1f20065e8f54c5c4894c76ddcd4e3687a83fefa80960a201d21b"}, "2": {"node_id": "496adb27-40fc-4a67-a4c2-1ecb59ba2007", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6b4ad148a0af07b9031df11bd1d056249606b802bd5cd9ae409d4d639334a383"}}, "hash": "554e000ab3faf9eb410ebdab8b16d398f5459fc0db99d4caa64af8d3db5e266e", "text": "During the COVID\u201319 PHE, we saw that industry performance declined on some measures included in the 2022 Star Ratings and for other measures industry performance increased. In order to allow non-CAHPS cut points to move with these changes in industry performance, we adopted a delay in the implementation of guardrails in the interim final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on April 6, 2020 with a March 31, 2020 effective date\n194at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) \nand 423.186(a)(2)(i). \nThe intent of guardrails was to \nimprove predictability and stability of cut points from one year to the next. At the time the addition of guardrails to the Star Ratings methodology was finalized, we also finalized the addition of mean resampling to the hierarchical clustering methodology to reduce the sensitivity of the clustering algorithm to outliers and reduce the random variation that contributes to fluctuations in cut points. Mean resampling was implemented \nbeginning with the 2022 Star Ratings. Since the addition of guardrails was finalized, we also finalized in the June 2020 final rule at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) adding Tukey outlier deletion to the hierarchical clustering methodology to improve the predictability and stability of cut points. (85 FR 33833\u201336). Tukey outlier deletion will be implemented beginning with the 2024 Star Ratings and will remove extreme outliers before the clustering algorithm is applied; this will improve the predictability and stability of cut points, which in turn minimizes the need for the guardrails to achieve such goals and weakens the rationale of the guardrails policy at the time the policy was finalized. \nAfter the April 2019 final rule was \npublished, we have learned during the COVID\u201319 pandemic that it is important for cut points to adjust for unforeseen circumstances that may cause overall industry performance to either increase or decrease. During the 2020 measurement year, we saw both significant increases and significant \ndecreases in scores across some of the Star Ratings measures.\n195As an \nexample, there was a significant shift downward in performance for the Breast Cancer Screening measure during the 2020 measurement year. For Breast Cancer Screening, the 5-star cut point for the 2021 Star Ratings was greater or equal to 83 percent, while for the 2022 Star Ratings it was greater or equal to 76 percent. This drop in the 5-star cut point reflects the change in industry performance. If bi-directional guardrails had been applied for the 2022 Star Ratings, this cut point would have been 78 percent rather than 76 percent, resulting in more contracts earning 4 stars rather than the 5 stars that they would have earned when compared to the performance of their peers in the absence of guardrails. Similarly, there was a significant shift downward in performance for the Diabetes Care\u2014Eye Exam measure during the 2020 measurement year. For Diabetes Care\u2014 Eye Exam the 1-star cut point for the 2021 Star Ratings was less than 63 percent, while for the 2022 Star Ratings it was less than 52 percent. This significant drop in the 1-star cut point reflects the downward shift in industry performance.

There was also a significant shift upward in performance for the MTM Program Completion Rate for CMR for PDPs during the 2020 measurement year. The MTM 5-star cut point for the 2021 Star Ratings was greater than or equal to 61 percent, while for the 2022 Star Ratings it was greater than or equal to 74 percent. This increase in the 5-star cut point reflects the change in industry performance. If bi-directional cut points had been applied for the 2022 Star Ratings, this cut point would have been 66 percent rather than 74 percent resulting in more contracts receiving 5 stars. These examples from the 2020 measurement year have led us to believe that bi- directional guardrails can inappropriately limit the ability of cut points to shift when there are unanticipated shifts in industry performance, causing misclassification in the measure-level Star Ratings assignments. \nIn addition, the combination of mean \nresampling and Tukey outlier deletion, with Tukey outlier deletion being finalized after the bi-directional guardrails policy, will provide sufficient predictability and stability of cut points from one year to the next when there are not significant changes in overall industry performance, but at the same time allow cut points to adjust when there are significant changes in performance as there was during the COVID\u201319 pandemic. We believe it is important for cut points to be allowed to shift by more than 5 percentage points when there are unanticipated, large changes in industry performance in the future. We are proposing at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) \nto modify the language so that guardrails for non-CAHPS measures will only be effective through the 2025 Star Ratings released in October 2024, and not apply for the 2026 Star Ratings or beyond. \nWe welcome feedback on these \nchanges. \nG. Health Equity Index Reward \n(\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3) and 423.186(f)(3)) \nAs discussed in section III.A of this \nproposed rule, advancing health equity is the first pillar of the 2022 CMS Strategic Plan and a goal of the CMS national quality strategy. In reports on accounting for Social Risk Factors (SRFs) in value-based purchasing programs, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) define Social Risk Factors (SRFs) as factors related to health outcomes that are evident before care is provided, are not consequences of the \nquality of care, and are not easily modified by healthcare providers.\n196 \nCMS agrees with the NASEM definition of SRFs because it captures the elements we consider important in defining SRFs. There are often disparities in health care \nand outcomes between groups with and without social risk factors (SRFs). For example, the within-contract LIS/DE and non-LIS/DE differences in performance for Part C and D Star Ratings measures can be found at: 2022 Categorical Adjustment Index Measure Supplement Dec 10 2020 (cms.gov). \nThe current approach to addressing \nSRFs in the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program has focused on adjusting for the average within-contract disparities in performance through the Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI), as described at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(2) and 423.186(f)(2), in order to not inappropriately penalize or reward health and drug plans for factors that are difficult for plans to control. For certain current Star Ratings measures, it may be more difficult for most plans to achieve the same level of care for groups that are socioeconomically disadvantaged, disabled, or more complex due to a variety of issues, including transportation issues, lower health literacy, communication challenges, and residential instability. The CAI is a factor that can be positive or negative and is added to a contract\u2019s overall and summary Star Ratings that adjusts for the average within-contract performance disparity based on a contract\u2019s composition of Low Income Subsidy/ Dual Eligible (LIS/DE) and disability status enrollees. \nThe CAI was implemented in the Part \nC and Part D Star Ratings program to address SRFs while measure stewards evaluated adjustment on a measure- specific basis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db3ad1b2-f4e3-452c-803f-4894bffc2ece": {"__data__": {"id_": "db3ad1b2-f4e3-452c-803f-4894bffc2ece", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ba0849c-16f2-49ef-a7b2-62f30a11e87c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "10e3eec1eea5db0a45ec8954a53f041175a81411fba42abe68883f0f050f2341"}, "2": {"node_id": "838b3cfa-aab8-4cd1-94b7-6f70ffbd9210", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "20340c59bab645478affb6b8daac76449358f60a7e31e7505eb3b554e9cd0bee"}}, "hash": "7076550ebad309e3b4a12e7c03907ab66bdf617a86e566717239ddd69da0cf2f", "text": "The CAI is a data-driven approach to account for within-contract disparities in performance associated with SRFs in Star Ratings measures that are not already adjusted according to the measure specifications developed by measure stewards. The CAI does not incentivize contracts to focus on reducing disparities. Although all contracts have incentives in the Star Ratings program to improve performance, there are currently no methodological adjustments that specifically create incentives to address disparities of care among a contract\u2019s enrollees. In addition to adjusting for within- \ncontract disparities through the CAI, we \nalso want to encourage MA organizations, cost plans, and Part D plan sponsors to better identify and then address disparities in care provided to enrollees with a particular SRF, with the ultimate goal of reaching equity by eliminating health disparities or differences in contract performance by SRFs, consistent with CMS efforts to advance health equity. \nCMS has developed a health equity \nindex (HEI) that we are proposing for use in the Part C and Part D Star Ratings that would reward contracts for obtaining high measure-level scores for the subset of enrollees with specified SRFs. Our intent in implementing an HEI is to improve health equity by incentivizing MA, cost plan, and PDP contracts to perform well among enrollees with specified SRFs. The CAI is designed to improve the accuracy of performance measurement, while not masking true differences in performance between contracts; in contrast, our proposed HEI reward is specifically designed to create an incentive to reduce disparities in care. The HEI, therefore, does not replace the CAI but rather assists plan sponsors in better identifying and then addressing disparities in care provided to members with a particular SRF, with the ultimate goal of reaching equity in the level and quality of care provided to enrollees with SRFs. There would be no changes to the current CAI with the implementation of the proposed HEI reward. \nWe are proposing to replace the \ncurrent reward factor described at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(1) and 423.186(f)(1) with the new HEI reward at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3) and 423.186(f)(3) starting with the 2027 Star Ratings; the HEI for the 2027 Star Ratings would be calculated using data collected or used for the 2026 and 2027 Star Ratings. The current reward factor was included in the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program beginning with the 2009 Star Ratings with the purpose of creating additional incentives for high and stable relative performance across measures by discouraging contracts from having a lot of variation in performance across measures (that is, a mix of low performance and high performance across measures). At the beginning of the Star Ratings program, the distribution of ratings across contracts looked very different, with overall performance much lower than it is today.

MA organizations have also responded to the incentive to perform well across measures as a result of the link between Star Ratings and Quality Bonus Payment ratings for MA contracts. CMS believes if we finalize the removal of the current reward factor from the Star Ratings methodology, contracts would still have incentives to perform well and improve because high performance on individual Star Ratings measures, including the Health Plan Quality Improvement and the Drug Plan Quality Improvement measures, translates into better overall and summary ratings. The removal of the current reward factor is contingent on finalizing the addition of the proposed HEI reward. \nCMS is proposing to add the HEI \nreward as a methodological enhancement to the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program starting with the 2027 Star Ratings because, similar to the current reward factor, it provides a summary of how performance varies across existing Star Ratings measures. The proposal to add the HEI reward is a methodological enhancement using data from existing Star Ratings measures; it is not a proposal to add a new measure with additional burden for contracts. In the case of our proposed HEI, however, this summary of performance would be based on performance related to a subset of enrollees with specified SRFs. Adding the HEI as a reward also allows for the methodology to include a performance threshold below which contracts will not be eligible for the HEI reward, which will incentivize improved performance by contracts for their enrollees with the specified SRFs and help reduce disparities. CMS could also potentially increase this performance threshold over time to incentivize continued efforts to reduce disparities in care. \nIn developing the proposed HEI \nreward, we considered a number of goals to ensure the incentives of the HEI and the associated reward were in line with our intent. We aim to improve health equity by incentivizing MA \nplans, cost plans, and Part D plan sponsors to perform well among enrollees with certain SRFs. These goals include: \n\u2022Avoiding rewarding large contracts \nover small contracts that may be providing high quality care for enrollees with the SRFs included in the HEI but lack the number of enrollees needed to reliably calculate the HEI. \u2022Avoiding rewarding contracts that \nmay do well among enrollees with the SRFs included in the HEI but serve very few enrollees with those SRFs, making it easier to do well. \n\u2022Only rewarding contracts that have \nhigh relative performance among enrollees with the SRFs included in the HEI compared to other contracts to incentivize high performance for enrollees with the SRFs included in the HEI. \n\u2022Ease of use and understanding for \ncontracts and other stakeholders. \n\u2022Minimizing the number of years of \ndata needed to calculate the HEI and HEI reward such that the data used are as current as possible. \n\u2022Allowing for updates to the \nmeasure set included in the HEI and updates to accommodate the addition of other SRFs to the HEI over time. \n\u2022Promoting improvement in \nperformance and enrollment of individuals with certain SRFs in MA plans, cost plans, and Part D plans. \n\u2022Accurately reflecting true \nperformance among contracts serving enrollees with certain SRFs and minimizing sensitivity to measurement error. \nThe proposed HEI would summarize \ncontract performance in relation to enrollees with certain SRFs across multiple existing Star Ratings measures into a single score using data from the most recent two measurement years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "023653f1-fa9f-4c2b-afce-3a5deeceaa92": {"__data__": {"id_": "023653f1-fa9f-4c2b-afce-3a5deeceaa92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3d47cf8-e87d-4494-b8a3-dd1e76b5f0a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "50d63b67f82e66f85fc62457ddb87bc1542d8807077fd39d5f6646c765a9c986"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2b133df-bc7a-4145-911b-335003b119d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "058616a904fe7131137cf8906bd136e13e0b95403b1cc5851f7ab97948c10adf"}}, "hash": "0d59be6135096c743b1a0e37452f4da7a55cf70e58b168d947f99184385e4057", "text": "We propose at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(i)(A) and 423.186(f)(3)(i)(A) to initially include receipt of the LIS or being dually eligible (LIS/DE) or having a disability as the group of SRFs used to calculate the HEI. Prior research has shown that dual eligibility is one of the most influential predictors of poor health outcomes, and disability is also an important risk factor linked to health outcomes.\n197The SRFs included in the \nHEI may be expanded over time. For purposes of the HEI, we propose to define an LIS/DE beneficiary as one who was designated as a full-benefit or partial-benefit dually eligible individual or who received a low-income subsidy (LIS) at any time during the applicable measurement period, as we do currently for the calculation of the CAI. If a person meets the criteria for only one of the two measurement years included in the HEI, the data for that person for just that year are used. We intend to use the original reason for entitlement to the Medicare program to identify enrollees with a disability for purposes of the HEI as we do for the calculation of the CAI. \nWe are interested in feedback on \npotential additional ways to identify enrollees who have a disability that could be incorporated over time and whether the same process and standards should be used for the CAI adjustment as well. In particular, we are interested in how we could expand the definition to include enrollees who develop a disability after aging into the Medicare program. LIS/DE and disability are the SRFs that have been used in the CAI for many years and are included in the confidential Part C and D Stratified Reports provided to MA and Part D contracts in HPMS as of 2022. As currently proposed, enrollees with these SRFs will be identified for the HEI the same way they are identified for the CAI at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(2)(i)(B) and 423.186(f)(2)(i)(B). \nWe also considered including the \nArea Deprivation Index (ADI) in the HEI at this time. The ADI is a measure of socioeconomic neighborhood deprivation, including measures of income, employment, housing, education, social environment, and readmissions. However, consistent with literature on the ADI, and other neighborhood-based indices,\n198our \nanalyses showed the ADI explains very little of the variation in the quality of care received beyond enrollee-level LIS/ DE and disability information. We will continue to explore the feasibility of adding other SRFs to the HEI over time. The addition of other SRFs or other mechanisms to identify enrollees with one or more of the SRFs that are part of the proposed HEI would be proposed through future notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe proposed HEI would examine \nperformance among those with certain SRFs for all Star Ratings measures unless they meet one of the specified exclusions.

Measures meeting this criterion would be excluded because these measures are not relevant for all contracts. \n\u2022At least 25 percent of contracts are \nunable to meet the criteria described at proposed paragraph (f)(3)(iv), which provides that a measure is only included for the HEI for a contract if the measure has a reliability of at least 0.7 for the contract when calculated for the subset of enrollees with the specified SRF(s) and the contract meets the measure denominator requirement when the measure is calculated for only the enrollees with the specified SRF(s) (that is, the SRFs included in the HEI). For Part D measures, this criterion is assessed separately for MA\u2013PDs and cost contracts, and PDPs. We are proposing to exclude any measures from the HEI that less than 25 percent of contracts can have reliably calculated because scores would be missing for most contracts. \nAs proposed at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(iii) \nand 423.186(f)(3)(iii), the measures \nbeing evaluated for inclusion in the HEI would be announced annually in the process described for changes in and adoption of payment and risk adjustment policies in section 1853(b) of the Act. These announcements (of the measures being evaluated for inclusion in the HEI) will not include the final list of measures used in the HEI for the upcoming Star Ratings because the data to determine that final set would not yet be available. In general, measures from HEDIS, HOS, and CAHPS would be included unless they meet one of the exclusion criteria, as previously described. Additionally, medication adherence, MTM Program Completion for CMR, and Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes measures would be included as long as they meet the requirements for inclusion for more than 25 percent of contracts. \nIn this section of this rule, we propose \neach of the five steps that CMS would take to analyze the measure-level scores for each contract and to roll up to the HEI scores in order to assess when an adjustment is available for a contract\u2019s ratings. \nStep 1: For each measure included in \nthe HEI, measure-level scores calculated for each contract among enrollees with \nthe included SRFs (that is, all enrollees who are DE, LIS, or disabled combined into one group) would be combined over the two most recent measurement years. CMS carefully considered the number of years of data needed for the proposed HEI. We believe that using 2 years of data allows for a balance between increasing measure-level reliability so that smaller contracts may still have enough data to have the HEI calculated and minimizing the number of years of data used. As outlined in our goals in designing the HEI, it is important to minimize the number of years of data used to avoid carrying forward very old data in the Star Ratings and to allow new measures and newer contracts to more quickly be included in the HEI. \nAs proposed at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(i)(B) \nand 423.186(f)(3)(i)(B), the scores for the subset of enrollees with SRFs of interest included in the HEI would be calculated using a modeling approach that includes year (that is, an indicator for whether the data are from year 1 or year 2) as an adjustor to account for potential differences in performance across years and to adjust the data to reflect performance in the second of the 2 years of data used. Scores are adjusted for year to account for situations where mean scores were, for the average contract, different in the 2 years (for example, higher in year 2 than year 1, or vice versa) and for contracts that have measure sample sizes that differ across years.

The CAHPS measures included in the Star Ratings are currently adjusted for DE and LIS. For the proposed HEI, for the subset of enrollees who are DE, LIS, or disabled in Step 1, we would not include the case-mix adjustment for DE and LIS when calculating the scores over the 2-year period for the CAHPS measures. If the proposal to implement risk adjustment for the three Star Ratings medication adherence measures based on the PQA specifications in section V.D.2.c. of this \nproposed rule is finalized, then we would not include risk adjustment for DE, LIS, and disabled enrollees when \ncalculating the scores over the 2-year period as described in Step 1. \nStep 3: For a measure to be included \nin the HEI for a specific contract, both of the following inclusion criteria in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(iv) and 423.186(f)(3)(iv) would need to be met: (1) reliability of at least 0.7 when the measure is calculated for the combined subset of enrollees with the specified SRFs across 2 years of data, and (2) measure-specific denominator criterion (for example, HEDIS measures require a minimum denominator of at least 30) is met when the measure is calculated for the combined subset of enrollees with the specified SRFs across 2 years of data. We are proposing at paragraph (f)(3)(vi) that contracts would also need to have at least 500 total enrollees at the contract level in the most recent measurement year used in the HEI. We are proposing a minimum in order to have reliable measure-level scores. For many of the Star Ratings measures (for example, HEDIS and HOS measures) at least 500 enrollees are needed to have a sufficient number of enrollees to reliably measure the performance of the contract. \nStep 4: As we propose in \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(v) and 423.186(f)(3)(v), to calculate the HEI score assigned to a contract, the distribution of contract performance on each eligible measure among enrollees with the specified SRFs (that is, all enrollees who are DE, LIS, or disabled combined into one group) would be calculated and separated into thirds, with the top third of contracts receiving 1 point, the middle third of contracts receiving 0 points, and the bottom third of contracts receiving \u20131 point for each measure. For example, for the Breast Cancer Screening measure, we would calculate performance for all contracts for the enrollees with one or more of the specified SRFs (that is, for the enrollees who are DE, qualify for LIS, and/or are disabled) using the two most recent measurement years. We would then look at the distribution of scores for this measure for all contracts that have at least 0.7 reliability and meet the minimum denominator size for the measure. Contracts that score in the top third of all contracts would receive 1 point for this measure, the middle third \nof contracts would receive 0 points for this measure, and the bottom third of contracts would receive 1 negative point for this measure. The same analysis would be repeated for each measure included in the HEI. \nStep 5: For each contract, the HEI \nwould then be calculated as the weighted average of these points using the Star Ratings measure weights and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00178 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ee9d3bb-c007-4744-ad42-14b8e514606c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ee9d3bb-c007-4744-ad42-14b8e514606c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db5e0ea4-63d9-4ff0-bed5-fe50f2bef48b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "44154b7974fc94ad1693c373067d48123b72c09b27cfb53c26821bf8e90253eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "fee05c10-6f83-407e-98b8-2030a25d9152", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1fa8a8eb06a5bfd6ba0b22a9173ce7811e54f3f2ad20a7fdb4083117d5d77504"}}, "hash": "a6fd1aadcfbcbe26611804f5a77afce1049235f935b1702fa6f4826639e3bba3", "text": "79629 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nincluding only measures for which the \ncontract met all of the inclusion criteria specified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(iv) and 423.186(f)(3)(iv).

We propose to use the weight for the measure in the current Star Ratings year. For example, if the HEI were being calculated using data from the 2026 and 2027 Star Ratings year, the measure weight used would be the weight for the 2027 Star Ratings.

Four types of health equity indices would be calculated, with up to three health equity indices for each contract, as applicable, one for the overall rating for MA\u2013PDs; the Part C summary rating for MA-only, MA\u2013PD, and cost contracts; the Part D summary rating for MA\u2013PD and cost contracts; and the Part D \nsummary rating for PDP (that is standalone Part D) contracts. The HEI calculated for the overall rating would be based on all of the Part C and Part \nD measures that meet the inclusion criteria for the HEI for each MA\u2013PD contract. The HEI for the Part C summary rating would include all of the Part C measures that meet the inclusion criteria for the HEI for the contract. The HEI for the Part D summary rating would be calculated separately for MA\u2013 PD (including cost) and PDP contracts and would include all of the Part D \nmeasures that meet the inclusion criteria for the HEI for the contract. \nIn order to qualify for an HEI reward, \nwe propose at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(vii) and 423.186(f)(3)(vii) that contracts must have a minimum rating-specific HEI score of greater than zero.

This proposed HEI reward structure supports our goals for the HEI reward in that it avoids rewarding \ncontracts that do not serve many enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI, making it easier for them to do well, and encourages MA, cost, and PDP contracts to enroll individuals with SRFs. \nWe propose that contracts that have \npercentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRFs in a given year that are greater than or equal to one-half of the contract-level median percentage of enrollees with the specified SRFs up to, but not including, the contract-level \nmedian would qualify for one-half of the HEI reward. Contracts that have percentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRFs greater than or equal to the contract-level median would qualify for the full HEI reward. Table 6 is a high-level summary of how the HEI score is converted into the HEI reward. \nWe are also considering an alternative \nnon-tiered HEI reward structure, where \nall contracts with percentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRF greater than or equal to one-half of the contract-level median would qualify for the full HEI reward. Both the tiered and non-tiered HEI reward structures align with our goals of promoting enrollment of enrollees with SRFs and not rewarding contracts that may do well among enrollees with SRFs but serve very few enrollees in this population, although the tiered HEI reward structure goes further in aligning with these goals. The non-tiered HEI reward structure aligns better with the goal of ease of use and understanding for contracts and other stakeholders. \nWe propose at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(vii) \nand 423.186(f)(3)(vii) that the contract percentages of enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI would be based on enrollment in the most recent of the 2 years of data used to calculate the HEI. For example, if the HEI includes data from measurement years 2024 and 2025, enrollment would be from 2025. We recognize D\u2013SNP only contracts would meet the enrollment thresholds under either the tiered or non-tiered HEI reward structure; however, other plans that do not initially meet the thresholds can also work to increase enrollment of people with SRFs to meet the enrollment thresholds, which aligns \nwith the goal of promoting enrollment of enrollees with SRFs. D\u2013SNP only contracts would also need to perform sufficiently well among enrollees with the specified SRFs to qualify for a reward based on the HEI. One consideration in developing the proposed thresholds for the minimum percentages of enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI needed to qualify for an HEI reward is that higher thresholds could potentially create geographic barriers in certain parts of the country to qualifying for the HEI reward because there is variation by State in the percent of enrollees who are LIS/DE or disabled. Both the tiered HEI \nreward and non-tiered HEI reward structures account for this as all states have percentages of LIS/DE/disabled enrollees that are greater than one-half the contract-level median based on 2019 data, although the non-tiered structure goes further in addressing this concern, as many states do not have percentages of LIS/DE/disabled enrollees that are greater than the contract-level median. As specified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(vii) and 423.186(f)(3)(vii) the contract-level median and half of the contract-level median would be calculated and assessed separately for MA and standalone Part D (that is, PDP) contracts.

We would then add the estimated LIS percentage to the DE/ disabled percentage calculated from administrative data to get the LIS/DE/ disabled percentage of enrollees in Puerto Rico. This calculation could result in a slight overestimate since some disabled enrollees may also be captured in the estimated LIS percentage; therefore, contracts with service areas wholly in Puerto Rico would be excluded from our calculations to determine one-half of the contract-level median and the contract- level median of enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI. We believe that this approach would ensure equitable treatment of contracts with service areas outside of Puerto Rico. In our simulations of the HEI, we found that the slight overestimate had little impact on whether contracts with service areas wholly in Puerto Rico met the one-half of the contract-level median or contract- level median thresholds. \nWe also propose that contracts would \nneed to have an HEI score greater than zero on the HEI calculated for the given rating (overall or summary rating) to qualify for a reward for that rating. As specified at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(i) and 423.186(f)(3)(i), the HEI score for the overall rating would include the applicable Part C and D measures, the HEI score for the Part C summary rating would include only the applicable Part C measures, and the HEI score for the Part D summary rating would include only the applicable Part D measures. An HEI score of greater than zero means that the contract on average scored in the middle third or better across measures included in the HEI for enrollees with the SRF(s). HEI scores closer to 1.0 indicate better performance for enrollees with the SRFs included in the HEI. While we are initially proposing to require a minimum HEI score of greater than zero for contracts to receive an HEI reward, we may consider increasing this minimum score over time to continue to encourage improved contract performance for enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI. Any such increase to the minimum HEI score would be proposed through subsequent notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nWe propose at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(3)(viii) \nand 423.186(f)(3)(viii) that the HEI reward would vary from 0 to 0.4 on a linear scale for contracts that meet the threshold for the median percentage of enrollees with SRFs included in the \nHEI, with a contract receiving 0 reward if the contract received a score of 0 or less on the HEI and a 0.4 reward if the contract received a score of 1 on the HEI. Similarly, the HEI reward would vary from 0 to 0.2 on a linear scale for contracts that meet the threshold for one-half of the contract-level median percentage of enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI, but do not meet or exceed the contract-level median percentage of enrollees with SRFs included in the HEI. Contracts that cannot have an HEI score calculated (that is, contracts that do not have reliable measure scores or do not meet the denominator criteria for at least half of the measures included in the HEI or contracts that do not have at least 500 enrollees) would not receive an HEI reward. \nAs an example, if a contract meets the \ncontract-level median percentage of LIS/ DE/disabled enrollees and receives an HEI score of 0.722325, this would translate on a linear scale to a reward of 0.288930. That is, the size of the HEI reward would equal 0.4 times the difference between the HEI score and the threshold, divided by the difference between the maximum HEI score and the threshold (0.4*(0.722325\u20130)/(1\u20130), which equals 0.288930).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95d7a250-3dee-4464-8332-e2ffe159d6a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "95d7a250-3dee-4464-8332-e2ffe159d6a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c06492fe-dddb-4ccb-ae6b-6d2f1f83e7c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2bb303a72ba5db8ffdbf54578798c56f29bb15b358a3b138e7137f1a5dfaad91"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4d357b1-52fb-4822-a708-03c2fa4037c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0fbddc3409c6c0c1e0dc04f849b799db2277e8021add490e67b25880672c5f29"}, "3": {"node_id": "96478637-33e8-45e5-95fd-d89daed8f5e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d5e8fe75326ba900b4a292cccc43a068da2305955c6f587920845186778343ac"}}, "hash": "ea504dffc8592ac74308424bcfeb14714c469856b0af938a7aac7ac244aa96aa", "text": "As another example, if a contract meets one-half the contract-level median percentage of LIS/ DE/disabled enrollees but does not meet the contract-level median percentage of LIS/DE/disabled enrollees and receives an HEI score of 0.722325, this would translate on a linear scale to a reward of 0.144465.

Half of MA and cost contracts were at or above the median, 33 percent were at or above one-half the median up to but not including the median, and 17 percent were below one-half the median. In the simulations, 88 percent of MA\u2013PD contracts that received an overall rating received an HEI score, 42 percent received an HEI score greater than zero, and 34 percent received an HEI reward. The range of HEI scores among MA\u2013PD contracts for the overall rating was \u20130.888889 to 1.000000. The average reward for the overall rating among MA\u2013PD contracts with an HEI score greater than zero was 0.109.

The range of HEI scores \namong PDP contracts was \u20131.000000 to 1.000000. The average reward among PDP contracts with an HEI score greater than zero was 0.160. Compared to the 2021 Star Ratings, 3 (5.3 percent) PDP contracts gained one-half star on the Part D Summary Rating and 7 (12.3 percent) PDP contracts lost one-half star on the Part D Summary Rating. \nWe solicit comment on these \nproposals. \nH. Improvement Measure Hold \nHarmless (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(g)(1) and 423.186(g)(1)) \nIn the April 2018 final rule, we \ndiscussed that one of the goals of the Part C and Part D Star Ratings program is to drive quality improvement for plans and providers (83 FR 16521). In that final rule, CMS adopted, at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(g)(1) and 423.186(g)(1), a hold harmless provision for the inclusion of the Part C and/or Part D improvement measures for contracts with 4 or more stars for the highest rating. Under this provision, the highest rating is calculated both with and without the improvement measures; contracts with 4 or more stars without including the improvement measures are held harmless from having the highest rating reduced by the addition of the improvement measures. The original intent of this hold harmless provision was to recognize that higher performing contracts have less room to improve (83 FR 16578). \nOur experience with the Part C and \nPart D Star Ratings program since this policy was finalized suggests that \ncontracts with 4 or 4.5 stars for their highest rating still have room for improvement. For example, based on a review of data from the 2020 Star Ratings, MA\u2013PD contracts with 4 stars for the overall rating received 5 stars on 42 percent of measures on average, those with 4.5 stars for the overall rating received 5 stars on 55 percent of measures on average, and those with 5 stars for the overall rating received 5 stars on 79 percent of measures on average. PDP contracts with 4 stars for the Part D summary rating received 5 stars on 26 percent of measures on average, those with 4.5 stars for the Part D summary rating received 5 stars on 28 percent of measures on average, and those with 5 stars for the Part D summary rating received 5 stars on 57 percent of measures on average. \nWe believe that the hold harmless \nprovision for the highest rating is not needed for 4 and 4.5 star contracts because they still have the potential to increase scores across measures and thus their Star Ratings. In order to encourage continued improvement across all measures for contracts with 4 and 4.5 stars for their highest rating, we propose to modify \u00a7 422.166 at paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) and \u00a7 423.186 at paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) to apply the improvement measure hold harmless provision to only contracts with 5 stars for their highest rating beginning with the 2026 Star Ratings. \nWe welcome feedback on this \nproposal. \nI. Extreme and Uncontrollable \nCircumstances (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i) and 423.186(i)) \n1. 60 Percent Rule \nCurrently, the Star Rating for each \nnon-CAHPS measure score is \ndetermined by applying a clustering algorithm to the numeric value scores from all contracts required to submit the measure. The cut points for non-CAHPS measures are derived from this clustering algorithm. As discussed in the April 2019 final rule and described at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(9), 422.166(i)(10), 423.186(i)(7), and 423.186(i)(8), we exclude from this clustering algorithm and from the reward factor calculations (under \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(f)(1) and 423.186(f)(1)) the numeric values for affected contracts with 60 percent or more of their enrollees in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated Individual Assistance areas at the time of an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance (84 FR 15776\u201315777).

When this rule was first implemented, the concern was that a contract impacted by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance would have significantly different scores than other contracts and that these significantly different scores would shift the cut points and/or reward factor thresholds for non-affected contracts. Our analyses since the rule was implemented show the measure scores \nfor affected contracts do not tend to be outliers and that this 60 percent rule can have adverse effects when extreme and uncontrollable circumstances affect nearly all contracts, as we saw with the COVID\u201319 PHE. \nWe are proposing to limit to the 2025 \nand earlier Star Ratings, application of the rule at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(9)(i), 422.166(i)(10)(i), 423.186(i)(7)(i), and 423.186(i)(8)(i) that excludes numeric values for affected contracts with 60 percent of their enrollees residing in FEMA-designated Individual Assistance areas at the time of an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance from cut point calculations and reward factor determinations. During the COVID\u201319 pandemic, we adopted a change to remove these rules temporarily since all contracts qualified for the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy as a result of COVID\u201319 in 2020; this change was adopted in the interim final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register and effective on September 2, 2020, and the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs; Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID\u201319 Public Health Emergency; etc.\u2019\u2019 which appeared in the Federal Register on May 9, 2022 and effective \non June 28, 2022 (hereinafter referred to as the May 2022 final rule). The removal of the 60 percent rule was necessary to calculate measure stars for most measures for the 2022 Star Ratings and for HEDIS measures that are based on the Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) (HEDIS\u2013HOS measures) for the 2023 Star Ratings. Without the removal of the rule, CMS would not have been able to calculate stars for most measures for 2022 Star Ratings and for the HEDIS\u2013 HOS measures for the 2023 Star Ratings because all contracts qualified for the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy as a result of COVID\u201319 in 2020. \nBeginning with the 2024 Star Ratings, \nmeasure scores that are extreme outliers will be removed through Tukey outlier deletion, a standard statistical method to remove extreme outliers, as codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i), prior to applying the \nclustering methodology to determine the cut points.

Thus, if a contract is impacted by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and as a result has a significantly lower score on a measure, \nthe score would be removed if it is an extreme outlier. Removing extreme outliers will eliminate the concern that other contracts are inappropriately impacted by changes in scores for contracts impacted by disasters. By removing the 60 percent rule, we will also simplify the Star Ratings calculations and continue to allow measure-level Star Ratings to be calculated if all or most contracts qualify for an extreme or uncontrollable circumstance in the future. \nWe are proposing to amend sections \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(9)(i), 422.166(i)(10)(i), 423.186(i)(7)(i), and 423.186(i)(8)(i) to remove the 60 percent rule beginning with the 2026 Star Ratings for non- CAHPS measures, including the Health Outcomes Survey measures even though the measurement period is slightly different for these measures. We welcome comments on this proposal. \n2. Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) \nMeasures \nWe adopted regulations for how Star \nRatings would be calculated in the event of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances in the April 2019 final rule. We explained in the April 2019 final rule (CMS\u20134185\u2013F) that for most measures, the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance adjustment applies for disasters from 2 years prior to the Star Ratings year (that is, a disaster that begins\n200during the 2020 \nmeasurement period results in a disaster adjustment for the 2022 Star Ratings). For Part C measures derived from HOS, the disaster adjustment is delayed an additional year due to the timing of the survey and 1 year recall period. That is, for measures derived from the HOS, the disaster policy adjustment is for 3 years after the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance. For example, we noted at 84 FR 15772\u201315773 that the 2023 Star Ratings would adjust measures derived from the HOS for 2020 extreme and uncontrollable circumstances. We are proposing to clarify in \u00a7 422.166(i)(3)(iv) the timing for HOS measure adjustments for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances. We welcome comments \non this proposal. \nJ. Quality Bonus Payment Rules \n(\u00a7 422.260) \nSections 1853(n) and 1853(o) of the \nAct require CMS to make QBPs to MA organizations that achieve at least 4 stars in a 5-star quality rating system. In addition, section 1854(b)(1)(C) of the Act ties the share of savings that MA organizations must provide to enrollees as the beneficiary rebate to the level of an MA organization\u2019s QBP rating. The administrative review process for a MA contract to appeal their QBP status is laid out at \u00a7 422.260(c). As described in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for Contract Year 2012 and Other Changes,\u2019\u2019 which was published in the Federal Register on April 15, 2011 (76 FR 21490\u201391), \u00a7\u00a7 422.260(c)(1) and (2) create a two-step administrative review process that includes a request for reconsideration and a request for an informal hearing on the record, and \u00a7 422.260(c)(3) imposes limits on the scope of requests for an administrative review. Historically, every November CMS has released the preliminary QBP ratings for MA contracts to review their ratings and to submit an appeal request under \u00a7 422.260(c) if they believe there is a calculation error or incorrect data are used. We propose to clarify in \u00a7 422.260(c)(3)(iii) some additional aspects of that administrative review process for appeals of QBP status determinations.

A calculation error could impact an individual measure\u2019s value or the overall Star Rating. Historically, if an MA organization believes the wrong set of data was used in a measure (that is, following a different timeframe than the one in the measure specifications as adopted in the applicable final rule), this is considered a calculation error. \nCurrently, \u00a7 422.260(c)(3)(i) provides \nthat CMS may limit the measures or bases for which an MA organization may request an administrative review. As described in 76 FR 21490, the appeals process is limited to data sets that have not been previously subject to independent validation. We propose to add a new paragraph in \u00a7 422.260(c)(3)(iii) to clarify that certain data sources would not be eligible for requesting an administrative review. We are proposing to clarify at \u00a7 422.260(c)(3)(iii) that an administrative review cannot be requested based on data accuracy for the following data sources: HEDIS, CAHPS, HOS, Part C and D Reporting Requirements, PDE, Medicare Plan Finder pricing files, data from the Medicare Beneficiary Database Suite of Systems, MARx system, and other Federal data sources. The listed data sources have either already been validated or audited or come from the CMS system of record for that type of data such as enrollment data, which make it inappropriate to use the QBP appeal process to challenge the accuracy of the data. For example, HEDIS measures and measures collected through the Part C and D reporting requirements have previously been audited or validated for accuracy; NCQA has a formal audit process for all HEDIS measures to check for accuracy, and MA plans sign off on the accuracy of the data following the audit and prior to the data being submitted to CMS. Similarly, data from the Part C and D reporting requirements are validated through an independent contractor (see 42 CFR 422.516(g) and \u00a7 423.514(j)) before the data are submitted by MA organizations and Part D plan sponsors to CMS and used for Star Ratings measures. (With regard to Part D data and measures, the MA organization offering an MA\u2013PD must comply with the applicable Part D regulations under \u00a7 422.500.) Because the MA organization bears the responsibility of data accuracy as well as signs off on audit findings in these situations, it is inappropriate to use the QBP appeal process to challenge the accuracy of these data. Organizations would have ample opportunity to raise any concerns about these data prior to submission to CMS for use in the Star Ratings. \nWe are also proposing that MA \norganizations cannot appeal measures that are based on feedback or surveys that come directly from plan enrollees.

Part D sponsors submit PDE to CMS via the Drug Data Processing Systems (DDPS), which processes and validates the data.

Similarly, Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) pricing files cannot be appealed. Plans use the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) Part D Pricing File Submission (PDPFS) module to submit their drug pricing and pharmacy data for posting on the MPF. After the data are submitted, CMS performs a multi- step validation. Validation results are provided to sponsors to correct their data or to attest to the accuracy of the data prior to display on MPF. Part D sponsors are required to perform their own quality assurance checks before submission to ensure that the files are complete and accurate.\n202 \nFurther, in conducting the \nreconsideration under \u00a7 422.260(c), the reconsideration official reviews the QBP determination, the evidence and findings upon which it was based, and any other written evidence submitted by the organization or by CMS before the reconsideration determination is made. Currently, \u00a7 422.260(c)(1)(i) provides that the request for reconsideration must specify the given measure(s) in question and the basis for the MA organization\u2019s reconsideration request; the alleged error could impact a measure-level score or Star Rating, or the overall Star Rating. The request must include the specific findings or issues with which the MA organization disagrees and the reason for the disagreement, as well as any additional evidence that the MA organization would like the reconsideration official to consider, as the basis for reconsideration. Currently, \u00a7 422.260(c)(2)(v) provides that the MA organization must provide clear and convincing evidence that CMS\u2019s calculations of the measure(s) and value(s) in question were incorrect; in other words, the burden is on the MA organization to prove an error was made in the calculation of their QBP rating. We are proposing to revise this standard to require the MA organization to prove by a preponderance of evidence that CMS\u2019s calculations of the measure(s) and value(s) in question were incorrect and to add additional language at \u00a7 422.260(c)(2)(v) clarifying that the burden of proof is on the MA organization to prove an error was made in the calculation of the QBP status. We believe that the appropriate standard of proof is the preponderance of the evidence. \nIf the hearing officer\u2019s decision is in \nfavor of the MA organization, the MA organization\u2019s QBP status is recalculated using the corrected data and applying the rules at \u00a7\u00a7 422.160 through 422.166.

We are proposing additional language at \u00a7 422.260(c)(1)(i) to clarify that ratings can go up, stay the same, or go down based on an appeal of the QBP determination. \nUnder \u00a7 422.260(d), CMS may revise \nan MA organization\u2019s QBP status at any time after the initial release of the QBP determinations through April 1 of each year on the basis of any credible information, including information provided during the administrative review process, requested by a different MA organization, that demonstrates that the initial QBP determination was incorrect. CMS issues annual guidance to MA organizations about the QBP \nappeal process available under \u00a7 422.260 each November titled, for example, \u2018\u2018Quality Bonus Payment \nDeterminations and Administrative Review Process for Quality Bonus Payments and Rebate Retention Allowances.\u2019\u2019 We interpret and implement \u00a7 422.260 through this guidance and our administration of the annual administrative review process. \nWhen the reconsideration official or \nhearing officer\u2019s decision for a particular appeal or other credible information suggests that there was a systematic error impacting all or a subset of contracts, the QBP status of all contracts is re-calculated using the corrected data and applying the rules at \u00a7\u00a7 422.160 through 422.166. If the re-calculated QBP rating for a contract other than the appealing contract results in a lower rating, the original preliminary QBP rating will be used. Thus, a contract\u2019s QBP rating will not be decreased by CMS as a result of a systematic re- calculation for the current Star Ratings and associated QBP year to correct a systematic calculation error; however, the issue identified will be addressed in the next year\u2019s Star Ratings. However, if the QBP rating is higher for a contract after the systematic re-calculation, the new rating will be used. For example, if CMS has to do a systematic re- calculation for the 2023 Star Ratings following the release of the preliminary 2024 QBP ratings, a contract\u2019s 2023 Star Ratings used for the 2024 QBP ratings will not be decreased but the change that caused a systematic recalculation will be addressed when the 2024 Star Ratings are calculated. If the re- calculation of the 2023 Star Ratings results in a higher rating for a contract, the higher rating will be used. We propose to add language at \u00a7 422.260(d) to clarify that a reopening of a QBP determination to address a systemic \ncalculation issue that impacts more than the MA organization that submitted an appeal would only be updated if it results in a higher QBP rating for other MA organizations that did not appeal. This is how we have historically noted how we would handle this type of systemic calculation error as described in our annual HPMS memo released in November each year. \nWe welcome comments on this \nproposal. \nK.

We further stated that with Tukey outlier deletion, extreme outliers will be removed from measure scores prior to clustering to prevent outliers from impacting cut points for all contracts.

We are proposing a technical amendment to fix this codification error from the May 2022 final rule. In addition, although the provision regarding application of the Tukey outlier deletion policy was originally at the end of paragraph (a)(2)(i) in each regulation, we are also proposing a non-substantive technical change to move the sentence about removal of Tukey outer fence outliers earlier in \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i) since Tukey outlier deletion is applied prior to the other steps.

Contract Year Definition (\u00a7 460.6) \nSections 1894(a)(9) and 1934(a)(9) of \nthe Act define the trial period for PACE \norganizations as the first 3 contract years operating a PACE program under a PACE program agreement. Sections 1894(e)(4) and 1934(e)(4) of the Act require CMS, in cooperation with the State administering agency, to conduct a comprehensive annual review of the PACE organization\u2019s operation of the PACE program during the trial period to assure compliance with all significant requirements. The rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)\u2019\u2019, which appeared in the November 24, 1999 issue of the Federal Register (64 FR 66234) (hereinafter \nreferred to as the 1999 PACE interim final rule) defined a contract year at \u00a7 460.6 as the term of the PACE program agreement, which is a calendar year, except that a PACE organization\u2019s initial contract year may be from 12 to 23 months, as determined by CMS. This enables CMS to adjust the length of the initial contract year so that it always \nends on December 31 and subsequent contract years align with a standard annual calendar year consisting of 12 months (64 FR 66236). For example, for a PACE organization that signs a program agreement in March 2022, CMS would extend the organization\u2019s initial contract year through December 31, 2023, so that all future contract years would align with calendar years. \nAs previously stated, CMS is required \nto conduct comprehensive reviews during a PACE organization\u2019s trial period to assess all significant regulatory requirements, and these reviews must be conducted on an annual basis for the first 3 contract years. Currently the first trial period contract year may include up to 23 months, but the subsequent two trial period contract years are limited to 12 months, each beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. CMS has developed audit protocols to comprehensively assess PACE organizations which require the availability of multiple months of program data and typically take 6 to 9 months to complete, including pre-audit data collection, audit fieldwork, and the corrective action period which allows time for PACE organizations to correct deficiencies identified during audits. CMS must conduct the first trial period audit within the first contract year in order to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. However, our ability to schedule and conduct the first trial period audit is limited by when a PACE organization enters into a program agreement, the current contract year definition in \u00a7 460.6, and when the PACE organization begins enrolling participants during their first contract year. Depending on when the program agreement is signed, the first trial period audit may be required within 12 months from the contract start date which we believe is not a sufficient length of time for new PACE organizations to establish their operations before undergoing an audit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6927da6e-2bcd-43b3-8316-05e2d3f2a9cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "6927da6e-2bcd-43b3-8316-05e2d3f2a9cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9579f56-dcc5-48f1-ac3b-b115e5108519", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d7bcba71f904077b94229b7ee3a0bc67475c952a7d2106c14b3c486c33a91017"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0a80cb6-d5f2-462b-bc25-11996fe07b3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37f0adf4ffb89b14724be090dafbcbcf17c5ba2cd563ba0540bfd1219e096a4f"}}, "hash": "7ddfe8a00f8ee32fd8fb58df60c453fd8821785cd82b9050cd7b5329bfd1db48", "text": "In order to have enough data to \nconduct a comprehensive audit, CMS has found it necessary to allow a PACE organization to operate with enrollees for at least 6 months before conducting its first trial period audit, which may not occur until the latter half or end of their first contract year. However, unless the first trial period audit is scheduled early in the calendar year, we encounter significant operational challenges conducting subsequent audits for the second and third years of the trial period in accordance with statutory and \nregulatory requirements, while still giving PACE organizations sufficient time between audits to ensure they are able to fully correct the deficiencies identified during an audit before CMS collects data for the next audit. Specifically, delaying the first trial period audit until later in the calendar year to ensure adequate PACE organization operational experience, reduces the time between audits, which creates overlap between timeframes to correct deficiencies and the data collection period for subsequent trial period audits. For example, under the current contract year definition, a PACE organization that enters into a program agreement on January 1, 2023 must receive its first comprehensive trial period audit by December 31, 2023, its second trial period audit in 2024, and its third trial period audit in 2025. If CMS first audits the PACE organization in early 2023, we would not have enough data to conduct a comprehensive review. However, waiting to schedule the first audit until later in 2023 reduces the timeframe within which CMS can schedule the second and third trial year audits required in 2024 and 2025. Given that a PACE organization may need 9 months to complete the first trial period audit initiated in 2023, and multiple months of data are required for each audit, it is operationally challenging for CMS to schedule and complete the next 2 annual audits within the trial period while still affording PACE organizations a sufficient amount of time between audits to correct identified deficiencies. \nCMS therefore proposes to amend the \ndefinition of contract year at \u00a7 460.6 to state that a PACE organization\u2019s initial contract year may be 19 to 30 months, as determined by CMS, but in any event will end on December 31. Under the proposed contract year definition, although the duration of the initial contract year of the trial period would change, the initial contract year would continue to begin when the program agreement is signed and end on December 31 to ensure subsequent contract years follow the standard annual calendar year cycle. For PACE organizations with an initial contract year start date of January 1 through June 1, CMS would extend the initial contract year through the following year. For example, for a program agreement signed on January 1, 2024 or up until June 1, 2024, the initial contract year would end December 31, 2025. The second and third contract years would begin on January 1, 2026 and January 1, 2027, respectively.

The second and third contract years would begin on January 1, 2027 and January 1, 2028, respectively. This would allow CMS to continue adjusting the length of the initial contract year so that subsequent contract years align with the calendar year, but it would provide greater flexibility around scheduling the first trial period audit. We believe that making the minimum length of time 19 months (as opposed to 12 months) would ensure organizations have sufficient time both to enroll participants and gain adequate program experience before their initial audit, while still allowing time to address deficiencies and implement improvements before engaging in another audit. In addition, this change would enable CMS to conduct the first trial period audit early enough in a calendar year that it does not adversely impact the second and third trial period audits. While we anticipate that this modification would allow us more flexibility in scheduling the first trial period audit, we intend to maintain our commitment to conducting first contract year audits as expeditiously as possible. For example, if a contract were signed on January 1, 2024, the initial contact year would extend to December 31, 2025 and CMS could potentially schedule the first trial period audit early in the 2025 calendar year. This would ensure that the PACE organization has sufficient time to operate before the start of the data collection period for the first trial period audit, and it would still allow CMS operational flexibility in scheduling the next two audits in 2026 and 2027. \nWe solicit comment on whether CMS \nshould consider a different timeframe for the initial contract year. Specifically, we are seeking feedback on whether CMS should consider defining the initial contract year as 25 to 36 months to allow organizations additional time to implement and operate a PACE program before undergoing their first audit. \nSince the effect of the proposed \nchange would be to provide CMS with more flexibility when scheduling initial \ntrial period audits without placing new requirements on CMS or PACE organizations, we believe this change would create no additional burden for PACE organizations. Additionally, we do not expect this change to have economic impact on the Medicare Trust Fund. B. Determining That a Substantially Incomplete Application Is a Nonapplication (\u00a7\u00a7 460.12 and 460.20) \nSections 1894(e)(8) and 1934(e)(8) of \nthe Act established CMS\u2019 authority regarding PACE provider application requirements. Based on this authority, we are proposing to strengthen the PACE regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 460.12(a) and (b) and 460.20(b), which pertain to application requirements, by further defining what constitutes a complete and valid application. \nCMS accepts PACE applications from \nentities seeking to establish a PACE program (initial applicants) or to expand an existing PACE program\u2019s service area (including both expansion of a PACE programs\u2019 geographic service area and/ or the addition of a new PACE center), on designated quarterly submission dates. \nIn order to receive funds under Part \nD to provide prescription drug benefits, PACE organizations must qualify as Part D sponsors under \u00a7 423.502(c)(1) by \nsubmitting an application in the form and manner required by CMS. Therefore, as a matter of necessity, initial PACE applicants that provide the Part D benefit to eligible beneficiaries must submit a separate Part D application. Effective March 31, 2017, CMS requires organizations to submit all applications electronically via the Health Plan Management System (HPMS).

The SRR is conducted by the State at the applicant\u2019s PACE center, and the accompanying report certifies that the PACE center satisfies all applicable local, State and Federal requirements and is ready for operations. CMS has instructed PACE applicants that this document may be uploaded when responding to a CMS request for additional information. \nThe application is not considered \ncomplete and valid without the required documentation from the applicable SAA that provides clear evidence of the State\u2019s support. However, in our experience, some PACE organizations submit a State assurances document that is not signed by the State, is provided after the designated submission date, or has changed the location of the proposed PACE center or included the corporate address as a placeholder. Should any of the aforementioned occur, the applicant is instructed to withdraw the application. \nUnder this proposal, we would treat \nany PACE application that does not include a signed and dated State assurances document that includes accurate service area information and the physical address of the PACE center as incomplete and invalid and therefore not subject to review or reconsideration. Entities that submit an application without a complete and valid State assurances document would have their application withdrawn from HPMS. They would then have to wait until the next quarterly submission date to submit the application with the State assurances included.

We propose to amend \u00a7 460.12(a), which states that an individual authorized to act for an entity that seeks to become a PACE organization or a PACE organization that seeks to expand its approved service area (through a geographic service area expansion and/or addition of a new center site) must submit a complete application to CMS \u2018\u2018in the form and manner specified by CMS\u2019\u2019 by adding a parenthetical with the words \u2018\u2018including timeframes for submission\u2019\u2019 after \u2018\u2018manner\u2019\u2019, in order to make clear that CMS will only accept applications that are submitted within the timeframes established by CMS. \nWe propose to establish at \u00a7 460.20(c) \nthat any application that, upon submission, is determined to be incomplete under proposed \u00a7 460.12(b)(3) because it does not include a signed and dated State assurances document with accurate service area information and the physical address of the PACE center, as applicable, would be withdrawn by CMS, and the applicant would be notified accordingly. Proposed \u00a7 460.20(b)(1) would further specify that the applicant would not be entitled to a hearing if the application is withdrawn based on that determination. Without the necessary evidence of support for the application by the SAA, the application would not be valid and therefore not subject to reconsideration.

To effectively oversee the PACE program, we are proposing to amend the PACE regulation at \u00a7 460.18 (CMS evaluation of applications) to incorporate an evaluation of past performance into the review of applications submitted by PACE organizations that seek to offer a PACE program or expand an approved program by adding a geographic service area and/or PACE center site or sites. Our evaluation of past performance would be a criterion CMS would use to review a PACE organization\u2019s application. The addition of this proposed evaluation criterion at \u00a7 460.18(c) would permit CMS to deny applications from PACE organizations based on the organization\u2019s past performance. Our past performance proposal takes into account any compliance letters received by an organization. We are also proposing to establish at \u00a7 460.18(d) that CMS may deny a PACE application if the PACE organization\u2019s agreement was terminated or not renewed during the 38 \nmonths preceding the date the application was first submitted to CMS. \nThe past performance of an \norganization is an important criterion for CMS to review when considering a PACE application because it provides valuable information about the ability of an organization to effectively operate a new program or expand an existing program. Organizations that have performed well are more likely to continue their high performance while organizations that have not may have difficulty meeting regulatory requirements in operating a new or expanded PACE program. This could pose a risk to the health and safety of the PACE participants they enroll.

We are modeling the PACE past performance proposal after the MA and Part D review regulations at 42 CFR parts 422 and 423, using applicable evaluation criteria in our proposal. We believe modeling the PACE past performance review criteria after the criteria that appear in the MA and Part D regulations is appropriate given that consideration of past performance has been a long-standing part of application reviews under the MA and Part D programs, resulting in the denial of applications of poor performing plans. CMS\u2019 goal is the same for PACE as it is in MA and Part D, which is to prohibit poor performing organizations from entering into new agreements, or expanding their service areas in the program. \nIn addition, we believe modeling past \nperformance reviews in PACE on past performance reviews in MA and Part D is appropriate since PACE organizations that provide Part D benefits are subject to the regulations at 42 CFR 423, with the exception of those regulations CMS has waived in accordance with \u00a7 423.458(d). In addition, modeling after MA and Part D reduces burden by not having a different set of criteria for the non-Part D PACE benefits. In keeping with this requirement, our proposal would ensure that all entities that submit PACE applications would be subject to past performance reviews, the same as other entities that submit Part D applications. \nIn the January 2021 final rule (86 FR \n5864), CMS established in regulation the methodology and criteria used to decide to deny an MA or Part D application based on prior contract performance (\u00a7 \u00a7 422.502(b) and 423.503(b)). We noted in the final rule that we may deny applications based on past contract performance in those instances where the level of previous non-compliance is such that granting additional MA or Part D business opportunities to the responsible organization would pose a high risk to the success and stability of the MA and Part D programs and their enrollees (86 FR 5999). In the January \n2021 final rule and through subsequent rulemaking, CMS adopted the following factors as the bases for denying an MA or Part D application: (A) the organization was subject to an intermediate sanction; (B) the organization failed to maintain a fiscally sound operation; (C) the organization filed for bankruptcy or is under bankruptcy proceedings; (D) the \norganization had low Star Ratings for two or more consecutive years; or (E) the organization exceeded CMS\u2019 threshold for compliance actions (see 86 \nFR 6000 and 87 FR 27704). Each of these factors, on its own, represents significant non-compliance with an MA or Part D contract; therefore, the presence of any of these factors in an applicant\u2019s record during the past performance review period could allow CMS to deny its MA or Part D application. \nCMS is now proposing to apply a past \nperformance methodology to entities that seek to offer a new PACE program or expand an existing program. Our proposal would modify the regulations at Part 460 to permit CMS to consider an entity\u2019s past performance in determining whether to approve or deny a new application or an application to expand a current program. The proposed methodology for this evaluation would be similar to the methodology CMS uses when deciding whether to deny MA and Part D applications based on past performance. As with our MA and Part D past performance reviews, the purpose of our proposed PACE past performance reviews is to prevent organizations from expanding their PACE operations where the organization\u2019s past conduct indicates that allowing the organization to expand would pose a high risk to the success and stability of PACE and PACE participants. Like MA organizations and Part D sponsors, PACE organizations that have been under sanction, failed to meet fiscal soundness requirements, or been issued compliance actions above a certain threshold have demonstrated that they have had significant failures in operating their program. Consistent with the past performance standards for MA and Part D, and as we discuss in detail later in this proposed rule, we are proposing that CMS would deny an initial or service area expansion (SAE) application based on the same factors (other than low Star Ratings) that serve as the basis for denying an MA or Part D application. CMS does not propose to include Star Ratings in the past performance review for PACE because CMS does not calculate these measures for PACE organizations. \nCMS accepts applications on \ndesignated quarterly submission dates from entities seeking to either establish a PACE program or expand an existing program.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "814f6bde-0f79-4621-84d9-f001b2ded472": {"__data__": {"id_": "814f6bde-0f79-4621-84d9-f001b2ded472", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "825e0269-fe05-4c1b-ab2e-6973c3d44ad6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f8834255ce00d92d80c14de7eb1035d988afcbeda68fc7914782f970088a5905"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0541811-7d10-4b6b-9e06-1bbb430bac3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e369f78a9ae96ca3c879cd08c1eabe4a7db54e53741b135de26feee6c9e7c562"}}, "hash": "ff70ee8a75c4b16acaaee90b084781916d4cb8b8f27249fac1dfb03d8659df53", "text": "Similar to MA applications, and in accordance with \u00a7 460.18, CMS evaluates a PACE application based on information contained in the \napplication itself, as well as information obtained by CMS (or the applicable State Administering Agency (SAA), \nwhich serves as the designated State agency for PACE), through on-site visits or any other means. If an organization meets all application requirements, CMS approves the application. \nCMS is proposing to incorporate past \nperformance reviews into the PACE application process to safeguard the program and ensure PACE participants are protected from the expansion of poorly performing organizations. The PACE program has seen significant growth in recent years, with increased numbers of both initial and expansion applications and steady increases in overall enrollment. This growth can be attributed in part to a legislative change that took effect in 2015 that allowed for- profit entities to operate PACE programs (see sections 1894(h) and 1934(h) of the Act). Prior to that change, only not-for- profit entities were eligible to offer PACE programs. At the end of calendar year 2016, a total of 121 approved PACE organizations were in operation, serving 37,584 predominantly dually-eligible participants. In calendar year 2021, CMS received 22 initial applications and 22 expansion applications. As of September 2022, there were 149 PACE organizations serving 54,643 participants in 32 states. \nPACE participants are some of our \nmost vulnerable beneficiaries. In order to enroll in a PACE program, the SAA must determine that the beneficiary needs the level of care required under the State Medicaid plan for coverage of nursing facility services (\u00a7 460.150(b)(2)). Beneficiaries who need this level of care are generally frail, may have multiple conditions, and require extensive assistance with activities of daily living. The PACE organization is responsible for providing care that meets the needs of each participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year (\u00a7 460.98(a)). Each PACE organization must have a center, which PACE participants can visit weekly or even daily, based on each participant\u2019s needs and preferences. The PACE center must provide primary care services, nursing services, social services, restorative therapies (including physical therapy and occupational therapy), personal care and supportive services, nutritional \ncounseling, recreational therapy, and meals (\u00a7 460.98(c)). \nGiven the recent and anticipated \nfuture growth in PACE and the vulnerable populations that PACE organizations serve, CMS believes that the past performance of a PACE organization should be reviewed as part of the application process.

Per the regulations at \u00a7 460.20(a) and (c), upon receipt of a complete PACE application, CMS must: (1) approve the application; (2) deny the application; or (3) issue a request for additional information (RAI) in the event there are deficiencies. CMS\u2019 deadline for these actions is within 90 days of submission of an initial application or for a service area expansion (SAE) application that includes both a proposed geographic expansion and a new center site, or within 45 days of submission of an SAE application that includes either a proposed geographic expansion or a \nnew center site. If CMS issues an RAI, the applicant must respond to the RAI only when ready and able to submit a complete response that addresses all deficiencies cited in the RAI, which includes a complete State readiness review (SRR) report, as applicable. If CMS issues an RAI, the first review clock ends and the second and final review clock does not begin until the applicant submits a complete RAI response, which starts the second and final 45- or 90-day review clock, as applicable. As part of the application process, the applicable SAA must conduct an SRR at the applicant\u2019s proposed PACE center site (if applicable) to ensure that the PACE center meets the State\u2019s regulatory requirements. Applicants are required to submit documentation of the completed SRR report to CMS for applications that include a new PACE center site (see \u00a7 460.12(b)(2)). Per application instructions, the SRR report is the only required document that may be uploaded after the initial application submission, in response to CMS\u2019 RAI. In our experience, a response to a RAI may take anywhere from a few weeks to more than a year to receive, often because of the renovation or construction of a center site, attainment of building permits, and/or the need for a readiness review to be completed. The MA and Part D past performance review currently has a 12-month look back period which is defined as the most recent 12 months preceding the \napplication deadline (see \u00a7 422.502(b) \nand 423.503(b)). Since MA and Part D applications are generally due in February of each year, this review period results in a 12-month look back period that covers the previous March through February of the year the applications are due. Similar to MA and Part D, we propose to use a 12-month review period under this PACE proposal, resulting in a review of an organization\u2019s past performance for the 12 months preceding the deadline established by CMS for the submission of PACE applications but also propose to apply the 12-month look back review upon receipt of the applicant\u2019s response to CMS\u2019 RAI. A 12-month look back period provides recent information on the operations of a PACE organization, which we believe is the best indicator of the PACE organization\u2019s current and future performance. \nWe propose, at \u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i), to \nevaluate the following components of an applicant organization\u2019s past performance starting with the March 2024 quarterly application submission cycle: whether the organization was subject to an enrollment or payment sanction under \u00a7 460.42(a) or (b) for one or more of the violations specified in \u00a7 460.40, even if the reasons for the sanction have been corrected and the sanction has been lifted; whether the organization failed to maintain fiscal soundness; whether the organization has filed for or is under State bankruptcy proceedings; and whether the organization has exceeded CMS\u2019 proposed 13-point threshold for compliance actions with respect to the PACE program agreement. We are proposing that, if any of those circumstances applies to the applicant organization, CMS may deny its initial or expansion application. \nSpecifically we propose at \n\u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i)(A) to include the imposition of enrollment or payment sanctions under \u00a7 460.42 for one of the violations listed in \u00a7 460.40 as a reason for which CMS may deny a PACE application, as noted in the paragraph above.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38252b70-d433-4af9-9095-76ba3e10a888": {"__data__": {"id_": "38252b70-d433-4af9-9095-76ba3e10a888", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc936087-f6c7-4053-a96f-673b68282ad6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0cca9320c78146423aa8ceb500bbc5c3e28a80e281143f9cba542bfd51ecdb86"}, "2": {"node_id": "44e2d53c-0376-4fd0-bc2c-f26ac9592295", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5249416b863850416e6aa8c2531330289d714696a90f14e1324766025d4e0919"}}, "hash": "4cec1102b73216df22ba0d22838b366cd1bd792b0f6467e139c74b8348bf03c0", "text": "Currently, \u00a7 460.42 authorizes CMS to impose a suspension of enrollment or payment if a PACE organization commits one or more of the violations listed in \u00a7 460.40. Violations in \u00a7 460.40 include the failure of the PACE organization to provide medically-necessary services, discrimination in enrollment or disenrollment of individuals eligible to enroll in a PACE program based on health status or need for health services, \nand involuntary disenrollment of a PACE participant in violation of \u00a7 460.164. These violations are serious and egregious actions by the PACE organization. Organizations that have been sanctioned (enrollment or payment) based on their failure to comply with CMS\u2019 regulations have either admitted they failed to comply with PACE requirements or have appealed and a third party has upheld CMS\u2019 determination that the PACE organization has failed to comply with requirements. Because of the egregiousness of the actions that led to the PACE organizations\u2019 sanctions, we do not believe these organizations should be permitted to enter into new agreements, add new PACE sites, or expand their service area until the PACE organization corrects the issues that resulted in the sanction and ensures that such issues are not likely to recur. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i)(B) to \ninclude, as a basis for application denial, the failure to maintain a fiscally sound operation after the end of the trial period. For purposes of fiscal soundness, the trial period ends when CMS has reviewed independently audited annual financial statements covering three full 12-month financial reporting periods. The regulation at \u00a7 460.80(a) requires a PACE organization to have a fiscally sound operation. Under \u00a7 460.80(a)(1), a PACE organization must have a positive net worth as demonstrated by total assets greater than total unsubordinated liabilities. To monitor compliance with \u00a7 460.80(a)(1), CMS requires PACE organizations to submit certified financial statements on a quarterly basis during the trial period, and annually thereafter, unless CMS or the SAA determines that the organization requires more frequent monitoring and oversight due to concerns about fiscal soundness, in which case the organization may be required to submit certified financial statements on a monthly or quarterly basis (or both) (\u00a7 460.208). Fiscal soundness is a key factor in CMS\u2019 evaluation of past performance because CMS has a responsibility to ensure the organizations that provide health care services to our beneficiaries have sufficient funds to allow them to pay providers and otherwise maintain operations. The failure of an organization to have a positive net worth puts PACE participants in jeopardy of not receiving necessary health care. In addition, organizations that are not fiscally sound may not be able to continue operations, causing the organization to close doors, leaving all their PACE participants without PACE coverage. Based on this, CMS believes it \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00189 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b34e997-b8d0-4cdd-9851-6995cbe34a0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b34e997-b8d0-4cdd-9851-6995cbe34a0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9f2e018-a668-4df5-9be5-6e02d73e96d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c805727be1a1fd69bdaeced3ad014045610f64c8df5317e6099219371e671961"}, "3": {"node_id": "b41ae5af-1ea6-446c-aad4-dec3aa9ec2ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e4bd328cf4062c7e0294e1683fac358138b8041b68fe5ff9c64190482b07c257"}}, "hash": "fb7f5325cbd1a4c7a1351024b5d8937492ec04522bb302b1cc24bded6002b192", "text": "79640 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n203The CAPs CMS proposes to issue for purposes \nof compliance and take into account during past \nperformance evaluations to determine whether to deny PACE organizations\u2019 applications would be separate and distinct from CAPs issued under \u00a7 460.194(a)(2), which are corrective action plans that are requested and received in the course of audits. is in the best interest of the program to \nadd failure to maintain a fiscally sound operation\u2014specifically, failure to have a positive net worth as demonstrated by total assets greater than total unsubordinated liabilities\u2014to the list of reasons CMS may deny a new application or an expansion application from a PACE organization. \nWe propose to establish at \n\u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i)(C) that CMS may deny the application of an organization that has filed for or is currently in State bankruptcy proceedings. Similar to an organization that lacks fiscal soundness, an organization that has filed for or currently is in State bankruptcy proceedings is at great risk of not having sufficient funds to cover costs associated with running a PACE program. In circumstances where an organization has filed for bankruptcy or is currently in State bankruptcy proceedings, the outcome often results in the closure of an organization\u2019s operations, putting beneficiaries at great risk. Examples of participants being at risk may include the inability to find adequate and timely care, care coordination issues, loss of providers (especially primary care providers who are employed by the PACE organization), as well as loss of the social and emotional support the PACE organization provides. Thus, permitting an organization to expand while under bankruptcy proceedings is not in the best interest of the PACE program and CMS should be able to deny an application from any organization that has filed for or is in State bankruptcy proceedings. \nFinally, we propose to establish at \n\u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i)(D) that CMS may deny an initial application or an expansion application for a PACE organization that exceeds the proposed 13-point threshold with respect to CMS-issued compliance actions. Proposed \u00a7 460.19(a) would specify that CMS may take compliance actions as described at proposed \u00a7 460.19(c) (discussed in this section of this proposed rule) if CMS determines that a PACE organization has not complied with the terms of a current or prior PACE program agreement with CMS and an SAA. PACE organizations are required to adhere to requirements in sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act and in CMS regulations at 42 CFR part 460. Proposed \u00a7 460.19(a)(1) would provide that CMS may determine that a PACE organization is non- compliant with requirements if the PACE organization fails to meet set performance standards articulated in sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act, \nregulations at 42 CFR chapter IV, and guidance. In addition, proposed \u00a7 460.19(a)(2) would establish that if \nCMS has not previously articulated a measure for determining compliance, CMS may determine that a PACE organization is non-compliant if its performance in fulfilling requirements represents an outlier relative to the performance of other PACE organizations. \nCurrently, CMS issues three types of \ncompliance actions: Notices of Non- Compliance (NONCs), Warning Letters (WLs), and Corrective Action Plans \n(CAPs).\n203These actions are CMS\u2019 \nformal way of recording an organization\u2019s failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements as well as providing notice to the organization to correct its deficiencies or risk further compliance and/or enforcement actions. They also serve to document the problem and, in some instances, request details on how the organization intends to address the problem. \nCMS proposes to specify at new \n\u00a7 460.19(c) the types of compliance actions we currently issue. First, CMS proposes to specify that NONCs may be issued for any failure to comply with the requirements of the PACE organization\u2019s current or prior PACE program agreement. CMS typically uses NONCs to document small or isolated problems. They are the lowest form of a compliance action issued by CMS. CMS typically issues NONCs for the least egregious failures, such as a first- time offense, a failure that affects only a small number/percentage of participants, or issues that have no participant impact. An example of a failure that would lead to an NONC would be a failure to upload or correctly upload marketing materials. \nSecond, CMS proposes to specify that \nWLs may be issued for serious and/or continued noncompliance with the requirements of the PACE organization\u2019s current or prior program agreement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b41ae5af-1ea6-446c-aad4-dec3aa9ec2ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "b41ae5af-1ea6-446c-aad4-dec3aa9ec2ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9f2e018-a668-4df5-9be5-6e02d73e96d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c805727be1a1fd69bdaeced3ad014045610f64c8df5317e6099219371e671961"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b34e997-b8d0-4cdd-9851-6995cbe34a0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fb7f5325cbd1a4c7a1351024b5d8937492ec04522bb302b1cc24bded6002b192"}}, "hash": "e4bd328cf4062c7e0294e1683fac358138b8041b68fe5ff9c64190482b07c257", "text": "CMS typically issues WLs as an intermediate level of compliance action, between a NONC and a CAP. They are issued either when an organization has already received a NONC, yet the problem persists, or for a first offense for larger or more concerning problems, such as failure to provide medically necessary services. Unlike NONCs, these letters contain warning language about the potential consequences to the organization should the non-compliant \nperformance continue. Similar to CAPs, WLs are issued for more egregious instances of non-compliance or continued non-compliance. However, they are issued when the egregiousness or continued non-compliance may not warrant a CAP. For example, a WL might be issued when a PACE organization has failed to have the full interdisciplinary team (IDT) involved in the review of participant care plans, which may have or did result in participants not receiving necessary care. CMS might determine, based on a review of factors such as the types of care not received, that the PACE organization\u2019s non-compliance does not warrant a CAP, and issue a WL instead. \nThird, CMS proposes to specify that \nthe last type of compliance action, the CAP, is the most serious type of compliance action and may be issued for particularly egregious or continued noncompliance. CMS may determine that the PACE organization has repeated, not corrected, or has a new deficiency which substantially impacts beneficiaries. In these cases, CMS requires the PACE organization to implement a CAP. \nThe CAPs described in this proposed \nprovision are not the same as corrective actions issued under \u00a7 460.194(a)(2). CAPs issued under \u00a7 460.194(a)(2) require PACE organizations to take action to correct deficiencies identified by CMS or the State administering agency through reviews and audits of the PACE organization (\u00a7 460.194(a)(2)). CMS has a formal audit process, which identifies non-compliance. CMS issues CAPs under 460.194(a)(2) as a result of reviews or audits. These CAPs are routinely requested and PACE organizations submit them to CMS as a means of addressing deficiencies identified during reviews or audits. CMS expects to continue to request CAPs as necessary under 460.194(a)(2) in response to deficiencies identified through reviews or audits; nothing about this proposal would change that process. \nConsistent with the past performance \nmethodology applicable to MA, we propose to assign points to each type of compliance action taken by CMS against PACE organizations. We then propose to apply a compliance action threshold to \ndetermine if the PACE organization that submitted the application exceeds the threshold and should be denied. The following points would be assigned: CAP\u20146 points, WL\u20143 points, NONC\u2014 1 point. CMS will then total the points accrued by the applicant organization, and if the total meets or exceeds 13 points during the 12-month review \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00190 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20b7a86e-2e39-4a0a-89c8-4dd7222541f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "20b7a86e-2e39-4a0a-89c8-4dd7222541f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c33befda-0f2c-463c-a278-17e2663adb38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8baf39074eec71feed85f6b084759036b89aa4b364b3f773f85277ff08a341b1"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2121e49-2b41-4cbd-947a-00a110a323cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "005b51401023980716a4eaf02f7feac48a01c5893f0437bcfaec9254be307c8f"}}, "hash": "e08bab11c0635cbf0863a306e96206382a05dfe34a8d00e5b371c74d9e283f21", "text": "79641 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nperiod, CMS may deny the \norganization\u2019s new or expansion application on the basis of past performance. \nWith the proposed addition of \ncompliance actions as a basis for the denial of applications, CMS is also proposing to specify at new \u00a7 460.19(b)the factors we currently use to determine whether to issue a compliance action and the level of compliance action that should be issued. \nAt \u00a7 460.19(b)(1) through (6), we \npropose to put in regulations the factors we currently use when determining whether to issue a compliance action and what level of compliance action to issue. As discussed in the paragraphs that follow, CMS considers the following factors: the nature of the conduct, the degree of culpability of the PACE organization, the actual or potential adverse effect on participants which resulted or could have resulted from the conduct of the PACE organization, the history of prior offenses by the PACE organization or PACE organization\u2019s contractors or subcontractors, whether the non- compliance was self-reported, and other factors which relate to the impact of the underlying non-compliance or to the PACE organization\u2019s inadequate oversight of the operations that contributed to the non-compliance. \nProposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(1) would \nestablish that CMS considers the nature of the PACE organization\u2019s non- compliant conduct. The nature of the conduct is relevant to CMS\u2019 determination of whether to issue a compliance action and the level of compliance action to take because failure to comply can range from an administrative issue to failure to provide necessary health care. Compliance issues that are less egregious in nature generally result in lower-level compliance actions. \nProposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(2) would \nprovide that CMS considers the degree of culpability of the PACE organization. \nThis factor is relevant because the PACE organization\u2019s failure may have been avoided if the PACE organization had performed differently. For example, if the PACE organization failed to properly train or failed to hire properly trained staff to assist participants in activities of daily living, such as bathing, and a participant fell and injured themself in the shower, the PACE organization would be more culpable than if staff were properly trained and the participant still injured themself. The PACE organization has a responsibility to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the participants, and its failure, either intentional or unintentional (for \nexample, lack of training, lack of oversight, lack of staff) would be a factor in CMS\u2019 decision about the type of compliance action to take. \nProposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(3) would \nprovide that CMS considers the effects or potential effect of a PACE organization\u2019s conduct on PACE participants. This factor is relevant because a PACE organization\u2019s failure to comply may have very different effects (or potential effects) on PACE participants and may affect varying numbers of participants. For example, an organization\u2019s failure to timely arrange for primary care could affect the vast majority of participants enrolled with that organization. However, an organization\u2019s failure to timely arrange for a very specific type of specialty care may affect only a few participants. \nProposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(4) would specify \nthat CMS considers the history of prior offenses of a PACE organization or its related entities. A PACE organization\u2019s (or its related entity\u2019s) failure to comply is relevant because the PACE organization should have ongoing processes in place to correct deficiencies as they occur and ensure that deficiencies are not likely to recur. As mentioned later in this section, organizations that have had recurrent compliance issues may be subject to a higher level of compliance action. For example, a PACE organization that failed to provide transportation to participants one year ago may have received a NONC at that time. If the organization fails to correct this deficiency after first being cited with a NONC for the deficiency, CMS may escalate the continued failure to comply by issuing a WL, based on the PACE organization\u2019s past history and continued failure to correct the deficiency. \nProposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(5) would \nprovide that CMS considers whether an organization self-reported a compliance failure.

If an organization has self- \nreported a compliance issue, CMS may decide to lower the level of noncompliance (for example, issuing a NONC instead of a WL) because of the organization\u2019s transparency with respect to the non-compliant behavior, since it is possible CMS would not have found the deficiency if not for the self- reporting. However, even if the organization did self-report the issue, CMS may decide against lowering the level of compliance action if, depending on the factors identified above, to warrant a higher-level compliance action. \nFinally, proposed \u00a7 460.19(b)(6) \nwould provide that CMS considers the PACE organization\u2019s failure to adequately oversee its operations. For instance, if an organization fails to properly pay claims, is aware of the issue, and fails to correct it (for example, by processing the claims accurately), or if the organization fails to do any monitoring or auditing of its own systems to ensure proper claims payment is occurring, CMS could take that into account in determining whether to issue a compliance action and, if so, the level of compliance action. \nAs previously mentioned, CMS \nproposes in a new \u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i)(D) that CMS would have authority to deny a new application or an expansion application if a PACE organization accumulates 13 or more compliance action points during the applicable proposed 12-month look back period. This would be the equivalent of just over two CAPs. Any organization whose performance results in issuance of two CAPs and a NONC, or whose performance results in any combination of compliance actions that add up to 13 points, should not be permitted to expand. \nCMS is proposing at \u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(ii) \nthat CMS could also deny an application from an organization that does not hold a PACE program agreement at the time of the submission, if the applicant\u2019s parent organization or another subsidiary of the same parent organization meets the past performance criteria for denial proposed in \u00a7 460.18(c)(1)(i).

It is likely that similar structures, policies, and procedures are used across legal entities that are part of the same parent organization, increasing the likelihood that any part of a parent organization that has at least one poorly performing legal entity may be at increased risk of poor performance. In addition, using other legal entities\u2019 performance when the new applicant has no history would also prevent organizations from manipulating CMS\u2019past performance methodology by establishing new legal entities and using those to submit PACE applications in order to avoid having CMS take into account the troubled performance history of the parent organization or its subsidiaries when reviewing the new legal entity\u2019s PACE application. \nIt would be especially important, \nwhen CMS reviews a new application from a legal entity that does not have activity that would constitute the past performance of that legal entity as a PACE organization, for CMS to be able to consider information from the current or prior PACE program agreements of the parent organization of the applicant, and from members of the same parent organization as the applicant. We are more frequently seeing initial PACE applications that represent unique and distinct legal entities that are part of a broader parent organization. In one recent instance, we reviewed an initial PACE application for a new legal entity under a parent organization that already had created a number of separate and unique legal sub-entities. In this case, in accordance with \u00a7 460.18(a) and (b), CMS considered the known adverse audit findings of other legal entities that were under the same parent organization, and which resulted in formal enrollment sanctions for the other legal entities. In the review of the new legal entity\u2019s application, we determined that the new legal entity was under the same \u2018\u2018umbrella\u2019\u2019 as the legal entities that had been sanctioned, because many of the key members of the executive leadership team were served in similar roles for both the sanctioned entities and the new applicant. CMS denied the application due to the nature of the deficiencies that led to formal sanctions for the related organizations. \nWe are also proposing one exception \nto this policy. A PACE organization that acquires an organization that would have an application denied based on any of the factors in \u00a7 460.18(c)(i) would have a 24 month \u2018\u2018grace\u2019\u2019 period that would extend only to the acquiring \nparent organization. This means that the acquiring organization would still be able to enter into new agreements or expand its programs under other agreements for which there are no performance issues for 24 months following the acquisition. It is in the best interest of the PACE program to allow PACE organizations that are meeting CMS\u2019 requirements to acquire poor performing PACE organizations without being penalized based solely on their acquisition. As stated in proposed \u00a7 460.18(c)(ii), this \u2018\u2018grace\u2019\u2019 period would be limited to 24 months from the date of acquisition. We believe this 24- month grace period would give an acquiring PACE organization sufficient time to \u2018\u2018turn around\u2019\u2019 a poor performing organization. \nFinally, we propose to add a new \nparagraph \u00a7 460.18(d) to provide CMS the explicit authority to consider prior termination history as part of the evaluation of an initial PACE or expansion application. Specifically, we propose that if CMS has terminated a PACE organization\u2019s program agreement under \u00a7 460.50(a), or did not renew the program agreement, and that termination or non-renewal took effect within the 38 months prior to the submission of an application by the PACE organization, CMS would be able to deny the PACE organization\u2019s application based on the applicant\u2019s substantial failure to comply with the requirements of the PACE program, even if the applicant satisfies all other application requirements. The 38-month period is consistent with the Part D regulations at 42 CFR part 423. Because PACE organizations that offer Part D are subject to 42 CFR parts 423 and 460, we believe a 38 month period is appropriate. This ensures PACE applicants are not unduly burdened by having two different sets of past performance requirements, resulting in two different timeframes. CMS does not unilaterally terminate PACE organizations\u2019 program agreements without significant failures, which are often failures affecting the furnishing or quality of care provided to PACE participants. Furthermore, a PACE organization whose program agreement has been terminated may appeal. If the PACE organization chooses to appeal and the termination is subsequently upheld through the appeals process, the organization has been found to have committed an action or actions that are egregious enough to warrant a termination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2011089-8f8a-418c-91c1-a125606f962c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2011089-8f8a-418c-91c1-a125606f962c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d4dc961-e740-4dbc-80d7-0b6286f0a653", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fcc5a0f29de801307a20ec962fa98c7417a27bb8ccd070f59e12e26ce4692a99"}, "2": {"node_id": "1642e93e-2356-4cfe-9640-f6534a94af48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2e8ef62b8165f034de6bd29f42861349c7704a8e95bd5101f3aefa4f15c1186d"}}, "hash": "f2f62f17db046cc0bfa911acc70517940a325d2dc3af4de903302052563bd7d2", "text": "If the organization does not appeal, then the organization is acknowledging CMS\u2019 ability to terminate its PACE program agreement.

Clarification of PACE Enforcement \nAuthority for Civil Money Penalties and Intermediate Sanctions (\u00a7 460.40(b)) \nIn the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs; Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)\u2019\u2019 (84 FR 25610), which appeared in the June 3, 2019 issue of the Federal Register, CMS amended \u00a7 460.40 by adding paragraph (b), which establishes that CMS has the discretion to take alternative enforcement actions in the form of civil money penalties (CMP) or a suspension of enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries by, or payment to, a PACE organization if CMS makes a determination that could lead to a termination of a PACE program agreement under \u00a7 460.50. In order to terminate a contract under paragraph (b) of \u00a7 460.50, CMS or the State administering agency must determine that both of the following circumstances exist: (1) there are significant deficiencies in the quality of care furnished to participants; or the PACE organization failed to comply substantially with conditions for a PACE program or PACE organization under this part, or with terms of its PACE program agreement, including making payment to an individual or entity that is included on the preclusion list, defined in \u00a7 422.2; and (2) within 30 days of the date of the receipt of written notice of a determination made under paragraph \u00a7 460.50(b)(1), the PACE organization failed to develop and successfully initiate a plan to correct the deficiencies, or failed to continue implementation of the plan of correction. \nIn circumstances where CMS has \nmade a determination under \u00a7 460.50 that could lead to termination, CMS would likely impose a CMP or suspension of enrollment and/or \npayment on a PACE organization prior to terminating the PACE organization, as authorized by \u00a7 460.40(b) (unless there was imminent risk to a PACE participant). This is because CMS views CMPs and suspensions of enrollment and/or payment as corrective in nature, since they are imposed when the PACE organization has been found noncompliant, and they provide time for the PACE organization to correct the issue(s) that led to the noncompliance \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00192 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dae887bc-f376-4f56-869a-942b6b346f8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "dae887bc-f376-4f56-869a-942b6b346f8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebe28b99-1d36-49aa-a286-1860d8422eae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5da7839c101c2c72d7dc3f6a28e52f89d686e7424eefca83f6a3cac6e5c759e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0e49c74-5f6f-4f90-89fa-8fde91fa9edf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "171c972de8d44e30b63ddf2f8036aa85d7991becca813625d235e7d71dc68de8"}}, "hash": "0b7ae8603545ad457b18f735e2045867fc7d37f8b1d9b495884ced9fd57b440e", "text": "79643 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nwith the ultimate goal of mitigating any \nactual or potential harm for PACE participants. \nAs previously stated, in order for CMS \nto take any enforcement action (CMP, suspension of enrollment or payment, termination) on a PACE organization based on the grounds for termination set forth in \u00a7 460.50(b), the PACE organization must fail to develop and successfully initiate a plan to correct the deficiencies, or fail to continue implementation of the plan of correction within 30 days of receiving notice. Given that CMPs and suspensions of enrollment and/or payment are corrective in nature and imposed prior to termination, CMS believes that providing PACE organizations an opportunity to correct prior to imposing a CMP or suspensions of enrollment and/or payment is unnecessary and most importantly an impediment to CMS\u2019 ability to protect PACE participants from potential harm. \nFor these reasons, CMS proposes to \nrevise \u00a7 460.40(b) by adding the following: \u2018\u2018If CMS or the State administering agency determines that the circumstances in \u00a7 460.50(b)(1) exist, neither CMS nor the State \nadministrating agency has to determine that the circumstances in 460.50(b)(2) exist prior to imposing a CMP or enrollment and/or payment suspension.\u2019\u2019 \nE. Personnel Medical Clearance \n(\u00a7 \u00a7 460.64 and 460.71) \nSections 1894(f)(4) and 1934(f)(4) of \nthe Act grant CMS broad authority to issue regulations to ensure the health and safety of individuals enrolled in PACE. The PACE regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 460.64 and 460.71 protect participants\u2019 health and safety by requiring PACE staff to be medically cleared of communicable diseases before engaging in direct participant contact. \nIn the 1999 PACE interim final rule \n(64 FR 66242), CMS added \u00a7 460.64, which sets forth certain personnel qualification requirements for PACE staff. When drafting these regulations, CMS reviewed the personnel requirements of other Medicare and Medicaid providers that serve populations similar to PACE participants (for example, home health agencies, nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities) (Id.). CMS also explained that in drafting these provisions we took a flexible approach that relied on State requirements as much as possible (Id.). \nIn the 2002 interim final rule, titled \n\u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE); Program Revisions\u2019\u2019, which appeared in the Federal Register \nOctober 1, 2002 (67 FR 61496), CMS added \u00a7 460.71, which sets forth oversight requirements for PACE employees and contractors with direct patient care responsibilities. CMS noted the importance of adding this new section due to the vulnerable frail population served by the PACE program and the increased opportunity for a PACE organization to contract out participant care services due to the amendment in the 2002 interim final rule which allowed PACE organizations to provide PACE Center services through contractual arrangements (67 FR 61499). One of the new requirements that the 2002 interim final rule adopted was the requirement at \u00a7 460.71(b)(4) for PACE organizations to develop a program to ensure that all staff \nfurnishing direct participant care services be \u2018\u2018free of communicable diseases.\u2019\u2019 In the rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE); Program Revisions\u2019\u2019, which appeared in the Federal Register on December 8, 2006 (71 FR 71243), herein after referred to as the 2006 PACE final rule, CMS amended \u00a7 460.64 to align with \u00a7 460.71(b)(4) by adding the requirement at \u00a7 460.64(a)(5) that employees and contractors with direct participant contact \u2018\u2018[b]e medically cleared for communicable diseases and have all vaccinations up-to-date before engaging in direct participant contact.\u2019\u2019 When adding this requirement at \u00a7 460.64(a)(5), CMS noted, \u2018\u2018It is standard practice in the health care industry that an individual must be cleared as free of communicable disease prior to employment\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018this is even more important with a frail elderly population considering their complex medical conditions and increased susceptibility\u2019\u2019 (71 FR 71267).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0e49c74-5f6f-4f90-89fa-8fde91fa9edf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0e49c74-5f6f-4f90-89fa-8fde91fa9edf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebe28b99-1d36-49aa-a286-1860d8422eae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5da7839c101c2c72d7dc3f6a28e52f89d686e7424eefca83f6a3cac6e5c759e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "dae887bc-f376-4f56-869a-942b6b346f8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0b7ae8603545ad457b18f735e2045867fc7d37f8b1d9b495884ced9fd57b440e"}}, "hash": "171c972de8d44e30b63ddf2f8036aa85d7991becca813625d235e7d71dc68de8", "text": "CMS also indicated in the 2006 PACE final rule that we were amending \u00a7 460.71 \u2018\u2018to be consistent with the general personnel qualifications\u2019\u2019 (71 FR 71328); as amended, \u00a7 460.71(b)(4) specified that all direct participant care staff and contractors must be \u2018\u2018free of communicable diseases and have all immunizations up to date before performing direct participant care.\u2019\u2019 In the June 2019 final rule, CMS amended the language in \u00a7 460.71(b)(4), which referred to staff being \u2018\u2018free of communicable disease\u2019\u2019 so that it instead referred to staff being \u2018\u2018medically cleared for communicable disease\u2019\u2019, which is the phrasing used in \u00a7 460.64(a)(5) (84 FR 25636). CMS explained that this inconsistency in language had caused confusion among PACE organizations about whether to \nattach the same meaning to \u2018\u2018medically cleared for communicable diseases\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018free of communicable diseases.\u2019\u2019 CMS amended \u00a7 460.71(b)(4) to use the phrase \u2018\u2018medically cleared for communicable disease\u2019\u2019 that appears in \u00a7 460.64(a)(5) so that the two provisions would be consistent and contain the same language (84 FR 25636). \nBased on our audit and oversight \nexperience, we have found that PACE organizations have many varied interpretations of what it means for staff to be \u2018\u2018medically cleared for communicable disease.\u2019\u2019 As a result, PACE organizations do not implement consistent methods for assessing or detecting communicable diseases. For example, some organizations require individuals to have a physical examination by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, whereas others allow for an assessment to be conducted by staff who are not licensed to evaluate individuals\u2019 medical conditions, and still other organizations only require a self-assessment completed by the individual seeking employment. While a physical examination by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner is sufficient for clearing an individual of a communicable disease, CMS does not believe that assessments conducted by unlicensed staff or self-assessments are sufficient to meet the requirement. \nFor the last 2 years, the COVID\u201319 \npandemic has demonstrated a need for a more comprehensive approach to infectious disease management and prevention. The elderly population was hit particularly hard by the pandemic, which highlighted the insufficiency of existing safeguards in nursing homes and similar care environments. While PACE participants live independently unless care is needed in a specific setting, they still require nursing home- equivalent levels of care. That care is typically provided in participants\u2019 homes and in the PACE centers, and participants interact with many different types of staff in those settings. We believe that the inconsistent approach to medical clearance that has been noted on audit has led to insufficient medical clearance, which places PACE participants at risk of exposure to communicable diseases including, but not limited to, COVID\u2013 19. Therefore, we are proposing to amend \u00a7\u00a7 460.64 and 460.71 to require all PACE organizations to develop and implement a comprehensive medical clearance process with minimum conditions that CMS deems acceptable \nto meet the requirement of medical clearance and to better protect the frail \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00193 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e10b670-ffaa-47d1-b34b-710e20a903d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e10b670-ffaa-47d1-b34b-710e20a903d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b165d3a-f335-4625-b71c-22ead6135059", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9339ab14f5e35cf6795f9290c882ab287c8a5a70a59c427b3631e74844f88b41"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc702188-43b1-4bdb-84a4-fa35d02f07bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "590549bee5eb3194757bb27b4a3e879eaa8e903a09bd8910932de145f66289da"}}, "hash": "920f84ec9b4e4ca8140db8e649fd189ebc03248fdd986b6c8e7ba694789f549e", "text": "79644 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n204Vaccines Indicated for Adults Based on \nMedical Indications | CDC. 205Meningococcal vaccination is also a \nrecommended immunization by ACIP; however, \nthis immunization is recommended for microbiologists who are routinely exposed to Neisseria meningitidis, which we do not believe is relevant to the PACE population or PACE staff. 206https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/testing/ \nhealthcareworkers.htm. \n207https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/testing/ \nhealthcareworkers.htm. and vulnerable population served by \nPACE. \nWe are proposing several \nmodifications to the requirement at \u00a7 460.64(a)(5). Currently, the language states that staff must \u2018\u2018be medically cleared for communicable diseases and have all immunizations up-to-date before engaging in direct participant contact.\u2019\u2019 First, we propose to separate the requirement to be medically cleared for communicable diseases from the requirement to have all immunizations up to date. We believe these are two separate and distinct requirements, and each serves a unique and important purpose. Specifically, we propose to create a new paragraph (a)(6) that would specify that each member of the PACE organization\u2019s staff (employee or contractor) who has direct contact with participants must have all immunizations up to date before engaging in direct participant contact. Proposed paragraph (a)(6) would include language specifying that, at a minimum, vaccinations identified in \u00a7 460.74 must be up to date. In response to the COVID\u201319 pandemic, we amended \u00a7 460.74 by adding paragraph (d), which requires PACE organizations to develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all staff are fully vaccinated for COVID\u201319 (see 86 FR 61555 at 61618). We believe citing back to this immunization requirement in new \u00a7 460.64(a)(6) would help ensure that PACE organizations are considering \nCOVID\u201319 vaccination status when ensuring staff have received all immunizations. Currently, while the regulation requires that \u2018\u2018all immunizations are up to date\u2019\u2019, CMS has not defined what those immunizations must include, other than the COVID vaccination referenced in \u00a7 460.74. Rather, PACE organizations have historically set their own requirements for what vaccinations should be considered as \u2018\u2018required\u2019\u2019 for their staff with direct participant contact. We considered defining all immunizations as including those recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunizations Practices (ACIP) for health care workers, including when they are applicable based on individual criteria such as age or past infection.\n204However, based on \nthe PACE population we are considering limiting the required vaccinations for PACE staff with direct participant contact to the Flu vaccine, Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR); Varicella; Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap); and Hepatitis B.\n205We solicit comment \non whether any specific vaccinations \nother than the COVID\u201319 vaccination should be required for each member of a PACE organization\u2019s staff (employee or contractor) that has direct participant contact. We are particularly interested in commenters\u2019 views on the vaccinations recommended by ACIP and whether they should be included among the immunizations required for PACE staff with direct participant contact. We would also solicit comment on whether we should use the ACIP list without modifications, or whether we should only require this subset of vaccines; Flu vaccine, Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR); Varicella; Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap); and Hepatitis B. \nAt \u00a7 460.64(a)(5), we propose to \nrequire that each member of a PACE organization\u2019s staff (employee or contractor) who has direct participant contact be medically cleared of communicable diseases both before engaging in direct participant contact and on an annual basis. Requiring staff to be medically cleared of communicable diseases annually will ensure that medical clearance is not a one-time requirement, but rather an ongoing responsibility. In our review of State requirements, we noted numerous states have some requirement for an ongoing or annual screening, and therefore it is reasonable to also propose that for PACE organizations.

When considering what to require for medical clearance we considered many different provider types, including hospital systems, and what different states require for medical clearance. We also considered the PACE population, and its vulnerability to communicable diseases. Based on these factors, we believe the best practice for PACE organizations is to have each individual with direct participant contact on a PACE organization\u2019s staff (employee or contractor) undergo a physical examination by a provider acting within the scope of their authority to practice. A physical examination requirement would ensure that staff are appropriately medically cleared prior to engaging in direct participant contact. \nWe therefore propose at \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(i) to require that staff who engage in direct \nparticipant contact must be medically cleared for communicable diseases based on a physical examination performed by a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant acting within the scope of the practitioner\u2019s authority to practice. This exam could be done at the PACE center by the primary care provider already \nemployed by the PACE organization, and therefore, it would not be difficult to operationalize. We also propose at \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(ii) that as part of the initial physical examination, staff with direct participant contact must be determined to be free of active Tuberculosis (TB) disease. It is important for organizations to screen for TB because it is a deadly disease and baseline testing is recommended by the CDC for all health care professionals.\n206 \nTesting for TB is widely available and relatively simple and we believe that a TB test should be conducted as part of any initial physical examination that is screening for communicable disease. We are proposing to add \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 into this regulation text, because annual TB testing is not recommended by the CDC unless a risk assessment is performed which indicates it is necessary.\n207 \nHowever, we also understand that not \nall individuals who have direct participant contact have the same level of risk of having communicable diseases (through previous exposures), and requiring a physical examination may be overly burdensome. Therefore, we propose that, as an alternative to medically clearing all staff with direct participant contact for communicable diseases based on a physical examination, the PACE organization could opt to conduct an individual risk assessment as allowed under proposed \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii). If the results of the risk assessment indicate the individual does not require a physical examination in order to be medically cleared, then a physical examination would not be required. This proposal would allow organizations to medically clear staff with direct participant contact by either conducting a physical examination, or by conducting a risk assessment of the individual and determining based on the results that no physical exam is needed. \nProposed \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii) would \nidentify the minimum requirements that the PACE organization must satisfy if it chooses to conduct a risk assessment for medical clearance.

For example, a risk assessment may include questions about an individual\u2019s current symptoms (if any), past diagnoses (specifically in regard to communicable diseases), and/ or recent travel to determine whether the individual is at risk of being infected with a communicable disease. While each organization should have the operational latitude to develop its own policies and procedures, consistent with these proposed requirements, to assess if an individual needs a physical examination, when drafting and implementing these policies and procedures, organizations should consider any applicable professional standards of care and/or any applicable State guidelines on medical clearance. \nProposed \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii)(B) would \nspecify that the purpose of the risk assessment is to determine if, based on the assessment, a physical examination is necessary for an individual. As previously mentioned, we believe that the best practice for medical clearance is a physical examination by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant acting within the scope of their authority to practice. However, by allowing PACE organizations to conduct a risk assessment to determine if some individuals on a PACE organization\u2019s staff who engage in direct participant contact (employee or contractor) may not need a full physical exam would provide some administrative flexibility for organizations. \nProposed \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii)(C) would \nrequire that the results of the risk assessment be reviewed by a registered nurse, physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant. We initially considered limiting these professions to primary care providers. However, we believe that because this risk assessment is used to screen staff to determine whether a physical exam is needed but is not itself a physical exam meant to diagnose an individual, it would be \nappropriate for a registered nurse to review those results and help triage staff that may need a more thorough exam. However, because registered nurses are not permitted to diagnose individuals, it would be inappropriate for a registered nurse to perform the physical examination. \nFinally, we propose to identify at \n\u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii)(D) the minimum requirements we would expect to be included in a PACE organization\u2019s risk assessment. First, we propose to require that any risk assessment developed by a PACE organization would assess whether staff have been exposed to or have symptoms of the following diseases: COVID\u201319, Diphtheria,\n208 \nInfluenza,209Measles,210 \nMeningitis,211Meningococcal \nDisease,212Mumps,213Pertussis,214 \nPneumococcal Disease,215Rubella,216 \nStreptococcal Infection,217and \nVaricella Zoster Virus.218When \nconsidering what communicable diseases to include in the risk assessment, we considered several resources, including State resources for reportable diseases, and we also considered information from the CDC on communicable diseases.

We would expect in those situations for a PACE organization to update its risk assessment to include that new public threat in the screening process. While we would want to account for new threats to public health, we recognize that the proposed language is more open to interpretation than listing specific diseases that may arise in the future. When developing this proposal, we considered CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency\u2019s primary method of sharing cleared information about urgent public health incidents with public information officers; Federal, State, territorial, Tribal, and local public health practitioners; clinicians; and public health laboratories.\n219It is likely that any threat to public health related \nto communicable diseases would be shared through this mechanism, but we solicit comment on whether this would be an appropriate source to consider, or whether there are other sources that CMS and PACE organizations should use. Because we recognize these sources may change over time, we are not inclined to add a specific source into regulation, but we solicit comment on that as well. \nWe also propose to require that a \nPACE organization\u2019s initial risk assessment must determine whether staff are free of active TB disease. We considered adding TB into the list of diseases in \u00a7 460.64(a)(5)(iii)(D)(1), however, we believe screening for this disease through a series of questions about exposure or symptomatology would not be sufficient to rule out this condition when conducting an initial evaluation of an individual. As aforementioned, the availability of testing for TB is wide spread, and all staff should be determined to be free of active TB prior to having direct participant contact. In order to ensure staff are free from active TB, a PACE organization should conduct either a skin test (with a chest x-ray when indicated) and/or blood test, as well as a physical examination if indicated, during the initial risk assessment process. \nWhile we have proposed an \nalternative to requiring a physical examination for every employee or contractor with direct participant contact (that is, by allowing PACE organizations to conduct a risk assessment), we are soliciting comment on whether we should eliminate the risk assessment from this proposal, and require all staff who engage in direct participant contact (employee or contractor) to undergo a physical examination by a physician in order to be medically cleared. As indicated earlier in our discussion, we believe a \nphysician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant is best qualified to determine if an individual is medically cleared from communicable diseases. \nWe discuss and account for the \nburden of updating the policies and procedures in the collection of information requirements section of this proposed rule. \nAs we previously discussed, the \nrequirement for medical clearance with respect to communicable diseases resides both in \u00a7\u00a7 460.64(a)(5) and 460.71(b)(4).

PACE Contracted Services (\u00a7 460.70) \nSections 1894(a)(2)(B) and \n1934(a)(2)(B) of the Act require that the \nPACE program provides comprehensive health care services to PACE participants in accordance with the PACE program agreement and regulations under those sections. Sections 1894(b) and 1934(b) of the Act set forth the scope of benefits and beneficiary safeguards under PACE. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act specify in part that PACE organizations must provide participants, at a minimum, all items and services covered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Act without any limitation or condition as to amount, duration, or scope, and all additional items and services specified in regulations based upon those required under the PACE protocol. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act also specify that, under a PACE program agreement, a PACE organization must furnish items and services to PACE participants directly or under contract with other entities. \nThe 1999 PACE interim final rule (64 \nFR 66234) was a comprehensive rule that addressed eligibility, administrative \nrequirements, application procedures, services, payment, participant rights, and quality assurance. As we noted in that rule, that rulemaking implemented the directive in sections 1894(f)(2) and 1934(f)(2) of the Act to incorporate into regulation the requirements applied to PACE demonstration programs under the Protocol,\n220to the extent consistent \nwith provisions of sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act. Among the required services included in the original PACE \nProtocol and the 1999 PACE interim final rule were medical specialty services. Specifically, the PACE Protocol identified a minimum subset of services that a PACE organization must provide, which was used to create the regulation at \u00a7 460.92. These medical specialty services included, but were not limited to, anesthesiology, audiology, cardiology, dentistry, dermatology, gastroenterology, gynecology, internal medicine, nephrology, neurosurgery, oncology, ophthalmology, oral surgery, orthopedic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, plastic surgery, pharmacy consulting services, podiatry, psychiatry, pulmonary disease, radiology, rheumatology, general surgery, thoracic and vascular surgery, and urology. \nIn the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR \n71244), CMS reviewed and addressed comments concerning the list of required services in \u00a7 460.92. Some commenters had expressed the view that the list was too extensive and noted that it was longer than the list of required services for nursing facilities, which the commenters suggested presented a potential dilemma for states to establish the cost effectiveness of PACE compared to the cost for nursing facilities. Other commenters recommended that CMS reevaluate the list to ensure it included the minimum requirements necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of consumers in the PACE program (71 FR 71280). \nIn response to these comments, CMS \nreiterated that the scope of benefits identified in sections 1894(b) and 1934(b) of the Act, and the requirement that PACE cover, at a minimum, all Medicare covered services, all Medicaid covered services, and any other services determined necessary by the IDT (71 FR 71280).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cda118a4-4350-4fd3-a118-a51d00da0ae6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cda118a4-4350-4fd3-a118-a51d00da0ae6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead2dad8-3fac-4e16-bc46-6e126502a481", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8c73e4336ffcb5fbde7f9a14621200b2a1b9a81b5e40dba0115390af184517ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff27dd19-c825-4b25-af40-ab6e6f393130", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b538c5ce09f8d685f0714831f14bbb210a377d29da549b4443e1acaba7acc61d"}}, "hash": "149a4e0bcfc0b6e9db2f653823ae842ff9b525e96620bd0b9041cf98cf8c0bde", "text": "However, following review of the comments, CMS determined it was not possible to provide a complete list of all inpatient, outpatient, physician specialty, care planning, and social support services that must be furnished to participants if ordered by the IDT (71 FR 71281). For this reason, CMS removed the listing of required services in \u00a7 460.92, including medical specialties; not because those services are not required in PACE, but because the PACE benefit covers even more services than the ones that had been initially listed under \u00a7 460.92, and we believed including an incomplete listing of specialties might be misunderstood to mean that specialties we did not list were not required services. Instead, \nCMS revised \u00a7 460.92 to state that PACE organizations are required to cover all Medicare covered services, all Medicaid \ncovered services included in the State plan, and any other services determined necessary by the IDT. \nWhile the list of specialties was \nremoved from \u00a7 460.92, CMS did not remove \u00a7 460.112(c) which establishes that PACE participants have a right to a choice of providers, within the PACE organization\u2019s network, that is sufficient to ensure access to appropriate, high- quality health care. Specifically, CMS stated that each participant has the right to choose both their primary care provider and specialists within the PACE network (71 FR 71296). CMS stressed that \u2018\u2018consumers with complex or serious medical conditions who require frequent specialty care should have direct access to a qualified specialist of their choice within a plan\u2019s network of providers\u2019\u2019 (Id.). CMS noted in that discussion that we expect the PACE organization to have contractual arrangements with primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists to meet the needs of their participants, and that CMS and the SAA would determine compliance with the requirement as part of the application process and through ongoing monitoring. (Id.). \nSince making these changes, we have \nseen through our monitoring and oversight efforts that some PACE organizations are not providing timely access to medical specialists. For example, based on data collected during 2021 audits (the most recent complete year of audit data), approximately 70% of organizations that were cited for a failure to provide necessary services were cited, at least in part, based on not providing necessary access to medical specialists. These delays in access have, in some instances, contributed to adverse impacts to participants including injuries, hospitalizations and death. Based on our experience, we have found that delays in accessing medical specialists sometimes occur as a result of PACE organizations not having contracts in effect for the medical specialties commonly utilized by PACE participants, such as the types of medical specialties enumerated in the 1999 PACE interim final rule. Therefore, we are proposing to add back into the regulation the list of medical specialty services identified in the original PACE protocol that the PACE organizations must ensure access to as a minimum requirement. Specifically, we propose to amend by adding language to \u00a7 460.70(a)(1) that specifies that PACE organizations are required to execute and maintain a contract with the following medical specialties: \nanesthesiology, audiology, cardiology, dentistry, dermatology, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00196 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "167108f1-4b8d-402c-904b-64db094e1f2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "167108f1-4b8d-402c-904b-64db094e1f2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5538ace9-949b-4e3e-8133-bc42daa73e97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c9f13a8ddd4897707599dbaa21a89010302754ad3d8ac23b1eb61b77a4745417"}, "3": {"node_id": "712a9f1c-fdc1-4218-b4e6-bc5a845b45eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b07643eef4c24cf8d9a7b0152f9fbb89378f8aa972e5bde526411d38301644bb"}}, "hash": "7eb3fe9d47305537318230b2980c04adfc01dd60c4b13ce55bdfdc039799cb2b", "text": "79647 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \ngastroenterology, gynecology, internal \nmedicine, nephrology, neurosurgery, oncology, ophthalmology, oral surgery, orthopedic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, plastic surgery, pharmacy consulting services, podiatry, psychiatry, pulmonary disease, radiology, rheumatology, general surgery, thoracic and vascular surgery, and urology. We considered adding the medical specialties to \u00a7 460.92, where it was originally located; however, the requirement is better suited in \u00a7 460.70(a)(1) for several reasons. First, most, if not all, medical specialists do not work directly for the PACE organization, and rather are contracted providers that would need to adhere to the other requirements in \u00a7 460.70. Second, by adding this requirement into the contracted services provision of the regulation, we believe it will allow CMS and State agencies to better assess PACE organizations\u2019 readiness to enroll by ensuring these contracts are in place prior to participants enrolling in the organization. \nWhile we are proposing to add a list \nof medical specialty services back into the PACE regulations, we continue to maintain that this is not an exhaustive list of all medical specialists that the PACE organization may be required to provide access to. For example, if the IDT determines that a participant needs to see a hematologist, the PACE organization would be required to provide access to that specialist in a timely manner. The specialties we are proposing to add in \u00a7 460.70(a)(1) would represent a minimum requirement for all PACE organizations; each PACE organizations should consider the needs of its participants to determine what additional medical specialists may be necessary for its network to be sufficient. While we are proposing to add back into regulation the 25 medical specialty services identified in the original PACE protocol, we solicit comment on whether CMS should include the following additional specialty services in the list of minimum required services: endocrinology, hematology, immunology, neurology, colorectal surgery, palliative medicine, infectious disease, physical medicine and rehabilitation. Additionally, while we consider psychiatry to be an important behavioral health specialist since they write prescriptions for psychiatric medicines, we are soliciting comment on whether there should be other behavior health specialists required in this list, such as psychologists or licensed clinical social workers. When submitting comments on this proposal, we ask that commenters indicate \nwhether they have any concerns with CMS adding any or all of the, previously discussed, specialty services to the list. For commenters who do have such concerns, we ask that you describe your concerns with specificity, so that we can more fully understand the nature and basis of your concerns. We believe a PACE organization must be able to access all these specialty services when a participant needs them, and based on our oversight experience, that these additional specialty services are often necessary for the PACE population. \nWe also propose at new \u00a7 460.70(a)(2) \nto require a PACE organization to execute these contracts with specialists prior to enrollment of participants, and to require the PACE organization to maintain such contracts on an ongoing basis to ensure participants receive appropriate and timely access to all necessary care and services. We clarify that we are not requiring PACE organizations to contract with individual specialists in situations where the PACE organization has contracted with a provider or practice that offers multiple specialties. In an instance of a medical provider or practice offering multiple specialties, the contract between the practice or provider, such as a hospital group, and the PACE organization would meet the requirement to contract with whatever specialties were included in the practice or provider group. We believe it is appropriate for organizations to be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient and direct access to these commonly needed specialists prior to participants enrolling in the organization. Through our auditing and oversight efforts, we have seen lengthy delays in specialist referrals when an organization has to contract with a new specialist, and waiting until a participant enrolls or has need of the specialist may create unreasonable delays in the participant being able to access that specialist. Additionally, as we noted in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71296), PACE organizations are financially responsible for all of their participants\u2019 health care needs, and delays in referrals for specialist services may have a significant impact on the PACE organization\u2019s financial viability. Failure to provide timely specialist referrals may lead to more expensive care, including the need for institutionalization, which can drive up operating costs for a PACE organization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "712a9f1c-fdc1-4218-b4e6-bc5a845b45eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "712a9f1c-fdc1-4218-b4e6-bc5a845b45eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5538ace9-949b-4e3e-8133-bc42daa73e97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c9f13a8ddd4897707599dbaa21a89010302754ad3d8ac23b1eb61b77a4745417"}, "2": {"node_id": "167108f1-4b8d-402c-904b-64db094e1f2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7eb3fe9d47305537318230b2980c04adfc01dd60c4b13ce55bdfdc039799cb2b"}}, "hash": "b07643eef4c24cf8d9a7b0152f9fbb89378f8aa972e5bde526411d38301644bb", "text": "At proposed \u00a7 460.70(a)(3), we would \nestablish that a PACE organization must make reasonable and timely attempts to \ncontract with medical specialists. PACE organizations are responsible for ensuring that participants have reasonable and timely access to medical specialty services, and that PACE organizations are responsible for taking appropriate steps in ensuring that they have suitable contracts in place in order to facilitate timely access to medical specialty services. We are not proposing to establish specific criteria for determining whether \u2018\u2018reasonable\u2019\u2019 attempts have been made for purposes of proposed \u00a7 460.70(a)(3), as what is reasonable would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, in an area with multiple providers in a specific medical specialty, it would not be reasonable to only attempt to contract with a single provider, if that provider indicated they were unwilling to contract with the PACE organization. \nWe further propose to establish at \n\u00a7 460.70(a)(3)(i) that if at any time a PACE organization is unable to directly contract with a specific entity to provide specialist services to participants, the PACE organization must still ensure ongoing access to necessary care and services that would otherwise be provided to participants by a contracted specialist, and that the participant\u2019s needs are met, through a different mechanism which may include hospitalization. As noted in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71296), we understand that in certain circumstances executing multiple contracts for a specific specialty may be difficult due, in part, to a limited number of specialists in certain geographic areas; however, we stress that PACE organizations continue to be responsible for meeting all of the participant\u2019s needs, even if there is not a direct contract in place. Additionally, under our proposal at \u00a7 460.70(a)(3)(ii) we would expect an organization to promptly report any contracting problems to CMS and the State Administering Agency (SAA), and include information on what attempts were made, the reason why the contract was not effectuated, and the PACE organization\u2019s plan to provide access to the necessary services. This reporting may be initiated by the PACE organization when reasonable attempts to contract have been made, and were unsuccessful; or it may be done in response to CMS or the SAA inquiring as to the status of the contracts.

For example, if there is only one specialist in a service area, and they are not accepting new participants, the PACE organization must show its attempts to contract and how it will ensure participants are able to receive the care that the specialist would have provided. In other words, in this example, the PACE organization must show that they reached out to the one specialist in the area, attempted to contract with that specialist, and were unsuccessful in those attempts. \nFinally, in order to account for PACE \norganizations that may choose to employ some medical specialists directly, such as dentists and podiatrists, proposed \u00a7 460.70(a)(4) would exempt a PACE organization from the contract requirements in \u00a7 460.70(a)(1) and (2) with respect to a particular medical specialty if a PACE organization employs one or more individuals prior to contracting who are legally authorized and, if applicable, board certified, in the particular medical specialty. While we expect that most of the specialists in this list would be contracted by the organization, we understand that there are times when a PACE organization may directly employ one of these specialty providers. In those instances, assuming the participants have sufficient access to that type of specialist through that employment, the PACE organization would not be required to contract with additional providers in that specialty. However, the organization must have the specialist actively employed prior to enrollment of participants in order for the exception to be met and cannot rely on future employment to satisfy this requirement. We believe that by modifying this provision as proposed we would not be increasing the burden on PACE organizations as they are already required to either obtain and maintain contracts with or employ \nmedical specialists. \nG. Timeframes for Coordinating \nNecessary Care (\u00a7 460.98(b)(4) and (c)) \nSections 1894(a)(2)(B) and \n1934(a)(2)(B) of the Act specify that the PACE program provides comprehensive health care services to PACE participants in accordance with the PACE program agreement and regulations under those sections. Sections 1894(b) and 1934(b) of the Act set forth the scope of benefits and beneficiary safeguards under PACE. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act specify in part that PACE organizations must provide participants, at a minimum, all items and services covered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Act without any limitation or condition as to amount, duration, or scope, and all additional items and services specified in regulations, based upon those required under the PACE Protocol. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act also specify that, under a PACE program agreement, a PACE organization must furnish items and services to PACE participants directly or under contract with other entities. Additionally, sections 1894(b)(1)(B) and 1934(b)(1)(B) of the Act require that a PACE organization must provide participants access to all necessary covered items and services 24 hours per day, every day of the year. This includes the full range of services required under the PACE statute and regulations. \nWe have implemented these \nrequirements in several sections of the PACE regulations. For example, at \u00a7 460.98(a), we require a PACE organization to be responsible for providing care that meets the needs of each participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. In order to meet participants\u2019 needs, PACE organizations must provide necessary services as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires; however, there is no specific timeframe on the delivery of services in PACE. The creation of a specific timeframe for delivery of services has been contemplated since the 1999 PACE interim final rule, where we noted that it was critical that care not be delayed and that the participant receive comprehensive care that maintains his or her functional status (64 FR 66251). However, we also noted that we recognize that some changes in the participant\u2019s plan of care (for example, installing a wheelchair ramp at the participant\u2019s home) may require more time to accomplish, and therefore CMS did not specify a timeframe for delivering services (Id.).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c9efde5-171b-4722-a174-2bde586f55ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c9efde5-171b-4722-a174-2bde586f55ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "197", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "546f1d12-314c-4e53-958f-75672b635e2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "197", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7e791faf2021005d17bce16b483a8add341666fa1916b7927693b350f3784df8"}, "2": {"node_id": "23185d81-eb7b-4a06-b141-33301b89eb9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "197", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "01ef19cf5135e11b462e581f93882ccaf1e3de28dda3f6fad3d3aff6c4c76590"}}, "hash": "feac66396ea9ab090a1ac759d0f10e0da95a786b6b7365fa8ef05597a64806ab", "text": "Although we chose not to specify a timeframe for delivering services in the 1999 PACE interim final rule, we solicited comment on the necessity of requiring a specific timeframe (64 FR 66251). In the 2006 PACE final rule, we noted that commenters were split on the topic of timeframes and indicated that further consideration of this issue was needed before CMS would propose to adopt a specific timeframe (71 FR 71292). We discussed this issue again in 2020 when publishing a proposed rule (85 FR 9138) and when finalizing the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 6034). We stated at that time that we did not believe we could implement a specific timeframe given the vast array of service that PACE organizations provide (Id.). We also noted that determining how quickly a service must be provided would depend on more than just the physical health of the participant, and PACE organizations should consider all aspects of the participant\u2019s condition, including their social, emotional, and medical needs when determining the provision of services (Id.). Therefore, we finalized \u00a7 460.98(b)(4), which requires that all services must be provided as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s health condition requires, taking into account the participant\u2019s overall medical, physical, emotional and social needs. \nDespite the difficulty in creating a \nspecific timeframe for the delivery of services, we continue to identify through monitoring and oversight situations where PACE organizations are jeopardizing participant health and safety by not promptly providing necessary services and that the cause for these delays is sometimes related to organizations failing to promptly schedule or arrange a service following approval from the IDT. Based on data collected through audits, in the past 4 years, over 80% of audited PACE organizations have been cited for a failure to provide services in a way that is necessary to meet participant needs. To address these concerns, we propose to establish timeframes for arranging the provision of IDT approved services for PACE participants. Requiring PACE organizations to promptly act to arrange or schedule necessary services creates accountability for expeditious service delivery while offering flexibility for wide ranges of services and variation in urgency. These timeframes would allow the IDT to determine how quickly a service is needed based on the participant\u2019s condition, but would ensure that the services were quickly arranged and scheduled to ensure that they are not forgotten or neglected in the course of other business. In drafting this proposal, we considered both the MA regulations in Part 422 and Medicaid regulations in Part 438; however, because PACE is not only an insurer, but also a direct care provider, we do not believe that the timeframes in these programs are appropriate for use in PACE.

This \nrequirement to refer residents to a dentist has a similar intent of ensuring the facility is promptly arranging for the necessary services for a resident. \nPresently, \u00a7 460.98 specifies PACE \nprogram service delivery requirements related to access to services, provision of services, minimum services furnished at each PACE center, PACE center operation, and center attendance. We propose to amend \u00a7 460.98 by, first, redesignating current paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) as paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), respectively. Next, we propose to add a new paragraph (c) with the heading \u2018\u2018Timeframes for Arranging and Providing Services.\u2019\u2019 In addition, we propose to move the requirement in current paragraph \u00a7 460.98(b)(4) to provide services as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s health condition requires, taking into account the participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional, and social needs to new paragraph (c)(4). We also propose to redesignate paragraph (b)(5) as (b)(4). \nWe propose that the new section \n\u00a7 460.98(c) would have four subparagraphs related to the timeframes for arranging and providing services. A \u2018\u2018service\u2019\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 460.6 means all services that could be required under \u00a7 460.92, including items and drugs. Given the vast array and differing availability of services in PACE, we considered creating one uniform timeframe for arranging all services, but ultimately determined that was not appropriate. Regarding the MA and Part D programs, we note that there are significant differences in the timeframes for approving and providing services under each program. In Part D, the timeframes for approving and providing coverage of medications are much shorter than the timeframes for approving and providing services in MA. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate in PACE to also create a distinct timeframe for medications. \nWe propose at new \u00a7 460.98(c)(1) to \nrequire PACE organizations to arrange and schedule the dispensing of medications as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires, but no later than 24 hours after the primary care provider orders the medication. We consider the use of the words \u2018\u2018arrange and schedule\u2019\u2019 to mean that the PACE \norganization has notified the participant\u2019s pharmacy or pharmacy service of the approved medication order and has provided all necessary information for the pharmacy to fill the medication order and provide the participant with timely access to the medication. This timeframe would not require the medication to be delivered to the participant within that 24 hours, unless the participant\u2019s condition required delivery in that timeframe. Additionally, we believe that \u2018\u2018no later than 24 hours after the primary care provider orders the medication\u2019\u2019 is a fair timeframe and critical to meet the immediate care needs of participants, as lack of prompt access to many medications could result in deterioration of a participant\u2019s condition. Additionally, as pharmacies are usually open seven days a week, and prescriptions can often be submitted electronically, we believe that there is limited burden on the organization in meeting this timeframe. We solicit comment on this proposal, including whether CMS should consider other maximum timeframes for PACE organizations to arrange and schedule the dispensing of medications, or exceptions to this requirement. An example of the type of comment we hope to receive would be one that addressed whether over-the-counter medications should be included in this timeframe, as those medications may have different methods of being filled. We solicit comment on alternative maximum medication authorization timeframes less than or greater than 24 hours after the primary care provider orders the medication and request that such comments address how the alternative timeframes would ensure participant health and safety. \nWe propose to establish at new \n\u00a7 460.98(c)(2) the requirement that PACE organizations arrange or schedule the delivery of IDT approved services, other than medications, as identified in proposed \u00a7 460.98(c)(2)(i), as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s health condition requires, but no later than 7 calendar days after the date the IDT or a member of the IDT first approves the service, except as identified in proposed \u00a7 460.98(c)(3). As previously noted, this requirement would apply to all services that are not medications.

We considered, but decided not to propose a 5 calendar day timeframe, because a 5 calendar day timeframe may be operationally impractical for instances in which a PACE organization receives a request late in the business week that requires scheduling a service with a specialist or medical office closed on weekends and Federal holidays. We also considered whether other programs had timeframes we could draw from, but because PACE is both an insurer and provider and is required to provide such a broad range of services, we did not find a comparable program or provider directly applicable to PACE for purposes of scheduling services. We then considered the needs of the \nparticipant and the operational challenges of the organization when developing the timeframe. Based on all of these factors, we are proposing a 7- day timeframe, which we believe will balance the needs of the participant with the administrative responsibilities of a PACE organization. Based on our oversight efforts, we understand that some organizations already act to arrange services within a timeframe of 7 calendar days or sooner, as the participant\u2019s health condition requires. We are also proposing to describe the action that the PACE organization must take within the proposed 7-day timeframe in terms of when services are arranged or scheduled with the expectation that the delivery of the service would not need to occur within this timeframe; instead, the PACE organization would be expected to take affirmative steps to make sure the approved service was set up, scheduled, or arranged within this timeframe, which may include scheduling appointments and/or purchasing the item the IDT approved. For example, if the IDT approved increasing a participant\u2019s physical therapy frequency from two to three times per week, we would expect the PACE organization to conduct outreach to the participant\u2019s physical therapist or the physical therapist\u2019s administrative support to set up a third weekly appointment within 7 calendar days of the IDT approval. If the IDT determines that the participant should see an ophthalmologist, the PACE organization would be required to schedule the appointment within 7 days of approval. We would not expect the delivery of the service (in this example, the actual appointment) to occur within 7 days, only that the appointment has been scheduled within that timeframe.

The 7-day timeframe begins once approval is made by the IDT or a member of the IDT. We would again stress that this is a maximum timeframe, and if a participant\u2019s condition required the service more quickly, the PACE organization would be expected to act to arrange the service more quickly. Our proposal would require that the timeframe of 7 calendar days begin after the date the IDT or a member of the IDT approves the service. We invite comment on alternative maximum timeframes for arranging or scheduling IDT-approved services. In particular, we are interested in knowing if PACE organizations continue to believe that 5 days is an appropriate timeframe to schedule and arrange services, and if not, whether commenters recommend a different maximum timeframe that is between 6 to 10 (that is, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10) calendar days after the date the IDT or a member of the IDT approves the service. Additionally, we solicit comment on whether there are additional definitions of \u2018\u2018arrange or schedule\u2019\u2019 that CMS should consider. We request that such comments address how the alternative timeframes would ensure participant health and safety, especially if commenters advocate for a timeframe longer than 7 calendar days. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2)(i)(A) \nthrough (D) to define which services are included in the definition of interdisciplinary team approved services. We propose to specify at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2)(i)(A) that this includes services approved by the full IDT. These services would typically be the ones discussed and approved during the course of IDT meetings. This would be any service other than a medication. For example, if the IDT met and decided to approve physical therapy for six weeks, the date it made that approval would then trigger the timeframe of 7 calendar days. We propose to specify at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2)(i)(B) that IDT approved services also include services approved by a member of the IDT. We believe this is important to emphasize to ensure that service determination requests that are immediately approved by a member of the IDT under \u00a7 460.121(e)(2) are subject to this new timeframe. Additionally, we have seen instances where a member of the IDT, in the course of their duties, may approve a service as necessary for a participant. For example, a physical therapist may approve extra therapy sessions during the course of their treatment. Or, following a recommendation from a cardiologist, the PCP may approve a Holter monitor for the participant. In these instances, when a service is approved by a member of the IDT, we would expect the PACE organization to promptly arrange and schedule the approved service within the 7 calendar days. We propose at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2)(i)(C) that IDT approved services include services ordered by a member of the IDT. We routinely see PCPs ordering necessary services as a part of managing the participant\u2019s condition, including but not limited to specialist consults, labs, and medications. We would consider an IDT member ordering a service as approving that service for purposes of proposed \u00a7 460.98(c)(2). For example, if a recommendation for a CT scan is made by an oncologist, and the PCP approves and orders the CT scan, we would expect the CT scan to be arranged within 7 calendar days from when the PCP approved/ordered the scan. We believe that it is important to specifically distinguish the types of approvals that could occur, as a part of the IDT\u2019s routine course of business, any one of which would trigger the timeframe of 7 calendar days to schedule or arrange for the delivery of services. We would also emphasize that under our proposal at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2), the timeframe begins when the IDT or a member of the IDT first approves a service. Therefore, when any one of these approvals occurs, on that first instance, the timeframe would be initiated. For example, if the IDT determined that labs were required for a participant in order to test their kidney function, the timeframe to arrange those labs would begin on that date, even if the PCP did not write an order for the labs until a later date or time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f01272dc-04c9-4d91-ac1e-39b6d6671d56": {"__data__": {"id_": "f01272dc-04c9-4d91-ac1e-39b6d6671d56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d20c16c-a7d5-4424-822d-00529f0db899", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "65205242c0368933b5593c9ca66e5e4eb573b123adb1a18472b8465e84333ca4"}, "2": {"node_id": "32e53ca3-e236-4a27-9030-23e04f992c4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9b92285be99a4ff2e75ebe00bd85276de3c033c00640fccb0bfef276e1854895"}}, "hash": "6e10d56fc5ad6c2c16b76b7bcb497182d305ecc138a234f88a1719f7ec11b4d8", "text": "We solicit comment on this provision, including additional considerations that could improve the definition of IDT approved services. \nWe propose at the new \u00a7 460.98(c)(3) \nto exclude routine or preventative services from the timeframe to requirement in \u00a7 460.98(c)(2) when certain requirements are met. We understand that PACE organizations may not be able to schedule every service within 7 calendar days, especially when the service is a routine service and not needed until much later in time. In order to satisfy this exception, we propose at \u00a7 460.98(c)(3)(i) through (iii) three requirements that would all need to be met in order for a PACE organization to \nbe exempt from the timeframe included in \u00a7 460.98(c)(2). First, we propose at \u00a7 460.98(c)(3)(i) that the PACE organization must document that they were unable to schedule the appointment for the routine or preventative service due to circumstances beyond the control of the PACE organization. We believe that this is a reasonable exception, as we understand that for some routine appointments, for example, an annual eye exam, the specialist or contracted provider may limit how far out they are willing to schedule appointments. We would expect the PACE organization to document its efforts to arrange or schedule the appointment and that they were unable to schedule the appointment due to the specialist\u2019s availability. Second, we propose to establish at \u00a7 460.98(c)(3)(ii) that the PACE organization is exempt from the timeframe as long the participant does not have a change in status that requires the service to be provided more quickly. We recognize that a participant\u2019s condition may change, and a routine appointment may become more urgent as the participant\u2019s condition deteriorates. The exception to the timeframes in \u00a7 460.98(c)(2) only applies when a participant does not experience a change that would require the service to be provided more quickly. If the participant does experience a change in status that would warrant a faster appointment, the exception would no longer apply, and the PACE organization would be expected to schedule the service as necessary. Last, we propose at \u00a7 460.98(c)(3)(iii) that the PACE organization may be excepted from the timeframes to arrange a service if the PACE organization provides the service as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires. While we understand that there may be circumstances that prevent a PACE organization from scheduling some routine or preventative services, ultimately the PACE organization always remains responsible for ensuring the participant\u2019s needs are met. We \nbelieve it is in the best interest of participants and administratively reasonable to require all three of these factors in order to exempt PACE organizations from the maximum timeframes proposed at \u00a7 460.98(c)(2) and to limit the exemption to services that are routine or preventative. We solicit comment on this provision, including suggestions of additional exceptions to the timeframes at \u00a7 460.98(c)(1) and (2). \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00200 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7632602-9bb5-4f51-9f23-449ed7b7495d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7632602-9bb5-4f51-9f23-449ed7b7495d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4406d5c-11ab-495e-9ee8-3b726c7c248f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5f656109fd372cb84ea7a5bcc9614770423952a677219fce5d75c406fc082e4e"}, "3": {"node_id": "198eeb08-8d40-4b79-9659-eb1763c49426", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7400309cceac618a75b18bfd86072c42520c1553c158856374ae85eaa613ab2b"}}, "hash": "1b133c40027b61953627be96f19bdbfba216b4bcc0a84ef9804f928bf32d6581", "text": "79651 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nWe propose to redesignate \n\u00a7 460.98(b)(4) as \u00a7 460.98(c)(4) without \nfurther modification.

Care Coordination (\u00a7 460.102) \nSections 1894(a)(2)(B) and \n1934(a)(2)(B) of the Act require PACE organizations to provide comprehensive \nhealth care services to PACE participants in accordance with the PACE program agreement and regulations under those sections. Sections 1894(b) and 1934(b) of the Act set forth the scope of benefits and beneficiary safeguards under PACE. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act specify in part that PACE organizations must provide participants, at a minimum, all items and services covered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Act without any limitation or condition as to amount, duration, or scope, and all additional items and services specified in regulations, based upon those required under the PACE protocol. Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act also specify that, under a PACE program agreement, \na PACE organization must furnish items and services to PACE participants directly or under contract with other entities. Sections 1894(b)(1)(B) and 1934(b)(1)(B) of the Act require that a PACE organization must provide participants access to all necessary covered items and services 24 hours per day, every day of the year. Additionally, sections 1894(b)(1)(C) and 1934(b)(1)(C) of the Act specify that PACE organizations must provide services to participants through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary health and social services delivery system which integrates acute and long-term care services in accordance to regulations, and specify the covered items and services that will not be provided directly by the entity, and to arrange for delivery of those items and services through contracts meeting the requirements of regulations. \nCMS has codified requirements \npertaining to the interdisciplinary team (IDT) at \u00a7 460.102. Although the PACE organization is ultimately responsible for providing comprehensive, multidisciplinary care that meets the needs of each participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, the IDT has a critical role in enabling the PACE organization to meet these responsibilities. As established in the 1999 PACE interim final rule (64 FR 66248), the IDT, then referred to as the multidisciplinary team, must comprehensively assess and meet the individual needs of each participant. In addition, the IDT is responsible for the initial assessment, periodic reassessments, the plan of care, and coordinating 24-hour care delivery (64 FR 66249).

We have also seen organizations interpret IDT responsibilities to coordinate care narrowly. For example, an IDT may order care, but then fail to ensure that the care has been provided in accordance with those orders and that the participant\u2019s needs were met. \nCurrent \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) specifies \nthat the IDT has responsibility for the initial assessment, periodic \nreassessments, plan of care, and coordination of 24-hour care delivery. Section 460.102(d)(1)(ii) states that the \nIDT is responsible for documenting all recommendations for care or services and the reason(s) for not approving or providing recommended care or services, if applicable, in accordance with \u00a7 460.210(b). We propose several amendments to \u00a7 460.102(d)(1). First, we propose to redesignate current paragraph (d)(1)(ii) as paragraph (d)(1)(iii), and to add a new paragraph (d)(1)(ii). We also propose to add a new paragraph (d)(1)(iv). \nWe propose to modify \u00a7 460.102(d)(1) \nto specify that the IDT is responsible for all activities as described at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) through \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv) for each participant. The proposed regulation would include the words \u2018\u2018for each participant\u2019\u2019 to emphasize that these responsibilities are not general requirements the IDT must fulfill, but rather specific responsibilities the IDT must fulfill for each participant. The 1999 PACE interim final rule (64 FR 66288) established basic requirements for the IDT at \u00a7 460.102(a), including that the IDT must comprehensively assess and meet the individual needs of each participant and that each participant be assigned an IDT at the PACE center that they attend. Since inception of PACE, CMS has considered the IDT responsibilities to apply to all participants at the individual level. CMS believes the current language in \u00a7 460.102(d)(1) does not preclude the proposed requirements at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) through \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv) from applying at the individual participant level. However, the addition of \u2018\u2018each participant\u2019\u2019 more clearly emphasizes CMS\u2019 expectations. \nWe propose to modify the \nrequirement at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) to include only the IDT\u2019s responsibility for the initial assessment, periodic assessment, and plan of care and to relocate the requirement pertaining to the IDT\u2019s responsibility to coordinate 24-hour care delivery to new \u00a7 460.102(d)(ii). We believe the responsibility to coordinate 24-hour care delivery is a separate and distinct requirement from the requirements to conduct assessments and create or revise a plan of care. Additionally, we propose to add a paragraph heading at \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) to read \u2018\u2018Assessments and Plan of Care\u2019\u2019 in order to reflect the proposed modified content of the paragraph. \nWe propose to move IDT coordination \nof care requirements from \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) to new \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii), because separating IDT coordination of care responsibilities at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) from the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00201 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "290441a6-ea65-4333-a27a-a616ec8060df": {"__data__": {"id_": "290441a6-ea65-4333-a27a-a616ec8060df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5ec613e-72d9-4d73-8df8-6793789ddb6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "816f8ff8357b198698ea23ce8c880a8fc454e5ca6ff63c930036a1027e4e13ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "55edd873-dfad-485f-8797-6a03c677f3c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "834d08be6b221a383a50746aa8ba5c26c0f41c55ab4c55d639c3a75fb6f7c7cc"}}, "hash": "7e0b4bb87befa6132675613ec047b286222d760da4f9111bc11ae64bc5aafb45", "text": "79652 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nassessment and care planning \nresponsibilities at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(i) improves the provision\u2019s readability. We also propose to modify the language of \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) and to add 5 paragraphs at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(A) through (E) to further specify what coordination of 24-hour care delivery involves by defining what actions we consider care coordination to include. \nWe propose at new \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) \nto require that the IDT coordinate and implement 24-hour care delivery that meets participant needs across all care settings. We added language into this requirement about meeting the participant\u2019s needs across all care settings in order to clarify the scope of the IDT\u2019s care coordination for all participants, including, but not limited to, participants residing in long-term care facilities. We also added \u2018\u2018implementation\u2019\u2019 into the requirement at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) because we have seen through audits and monitoring efforts that PACE organizations are interpreting \u2018\u2018coordination\u2019\u2019 narrowly, and they do not consider it to include all necessary components of care coordination, such as ensuring the implementation of care. As a result, we have seen problems with medication orders being implemented appropriately, wound care not being done in accordance with orders, and other necessary services not being provided to the participant. This proposal will further emphasize CMS\u2019 expectations of IDT coordination of care responsibilities and lead to better care for participants, especially participants residing in acute and long-term care facilities. \nThis proposal is consistent with the \ncurrent statutory and regulatory requirements for PACE organizations and the IDT. PACE organizations are responsible for providing care that meets the needs of each participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year (see \u00a7 460.98(a)). PACE organizations are also responsible for furnishing comprehensive medical, health, and social services that integrate acute and long-term care. We have received requests to explain the difference between the PACE organization\u2019s responsibility to furnish care, and the IDT\u2019s responsibility to coordinate care. As we explained in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 6036), PACE organizations are responsible for furnishing comprehensive services to PACE participants. The IDT, which consists of a subset of PACE organization\u2019s employees or contractors, is responsible for certain activities, such \nas coordinating care, which includes services that are furnished by the IDT as well as services furnished by other \nemployees and contractors of the PACE organization. The proposed requirement at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) for the IDT coordinate and implement 24-hour care delivery that meets participant needs across all care settings aligns with this interpretation, as the IDT is not always responsible for directly furnishing or providing the care to participants, but it always maintains responsibility for coordinating care for participants. \nAs previously noted, we are \nproposing to add 5 subparagraphs at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(A) through (E) that further specify IDT coordination responsibilities across all care settings. We propose at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(A) that the IDT is responsible for ordering, approving, or authorizing all necessary care in order to clarify CMS expectations regarding one aspect of the IDT care coordination responsibilities. PACE is a program designed around the IDT being responsible for authorizing and ordering all care that is needed for PACE participants. In fact, contractors, including medical specialty providers, must agree to furnish only those services authorized by the PACE IDT at \u00a7 460.70(d)(5)(i). We believe the proposed responsibilities at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(A) are important aspects of coordinating care that are inherent to the IDT\u2019s established and central role in care coordination. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(B) to \nestablish that the IDT is responsible for communicating all necessary care and relevant instructions for care. As discussed in connection with proposed \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(A), the IDT is already responsible for authorizing all care the participant receives; however, in order for the participant to actually receive the care, the IDT must communicate the orders and relevant instructions to the appropriate individuals. For example, while a PCP may order a specialist consult, it is often scheduling or administrative staff that are responsible for actually arranging the appointment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55edd873-dfad-485f-8797-6a03c677f3c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "55edd873-dfad-485f-8797-6a03c677f3c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5ec613e-72d9-4d73-8df8-6793789ddb6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "816f8ff8357b198698ea23ce8c880a8fc454e5ca6ff63c930036a1027e4e13ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "290441a6-ea65-4333-a27a-a616ec8060df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "7e0b4bb87befa6132675613ec047b286222d760da4f9111bc11ae64bc5aafb45"}}, "hash": "834d08be6b221a383a50746aa8ba5c26c0f41c55ab4c55d639c3a75fb6f7c7cc", "text": "As a part of coordinating care, the IDT must ensure that it communicates the necessary care and instructions to those individuals that need to know, for example, the individuals who will schedule, arrange, or provide the care and services. We contemplated adding further specificity in regulation about who those individuals may be, but we believe that it would encompass too many individuals for us to identify. For example, for a participant residing in a nursing facility, the IDT would need to ensure it communicated orders and instructions for care to the facility staff. \nFor scheduling appointments, the IDT may need to communicate orders to administrative staff. We believe the IDT \nwould be in the best position to identify the staff that need to know the information, and therefore we are leaving this proposed regulatory provision broad. \nWe propose to specify at \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(C) that the IDT is responsible for ensuring care is implemented as it was ordered, approved, or authorized by the IDT. We have seen through oversight and monitoring efforts that while the IDT will order or authorize care, the team does not always follow through on ensuring that the care is provided in accordance with those orders. For example, a PCP may order wound care 3 times a week, but then the IDT will not follow through on ensuring that the wound care is actually done in accordance with those orders. As previously discussed, the 1999 PACE interim final rule (64 FR 66279) established the IDT as instrumental in controlling the delivery, quality, and continuity of care. Part of controlling the delivery and quality of care is ensuring that the care that is ordered, approved or authorized is actually provided. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(D) to \nestablish that the IDT is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the participant\u2019s condition to ensure that the care provided is effective and meets the participant\u2019s needs. The IDT cannot appropriately coordinate 24-hour care delivery without also ensuring that it remains alert to the participant\u2019s condition by monitoring and evaluating the participant\u2019s condition. While the IDT is responsible for making sure that care is implemented in accordance with the approved or authorized orders, the IDT also remains responsible for ensuring the participant\u2019s needs are met through that care. For example, if the PCP orders wound care 2 times a week but the wound continues to worsen, the PCP should consider whether a new order is necessary in order to meet the participant\u2019s needs. \nWe propose to specify at \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii)(E) that the IDT is responsible for promptly modifying care when the IDT determines the participant\u2019s needs are not met in order to provide safe, appropriate, and effective care to the participant. The \nIDT\u2019s responsibilities for a participant do not end when care is authorized or ordered. As we stated in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71289), it is important for the IDT to monitor and respond to any changes in a participant\u2019s condition. It is important that the IDT respond promptly and modify care when it is determined that the participant\u2019s needs \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00202 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9647adc6-be0b-488f-b5d2-ceccf457292a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9647adc6-be0b-488f-b5d2-ceccf457292a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e2d50c7-7a22-470a-8963-371c7f140f41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0ffac36a55293c6716656843275acff9053502a4784f473f253773801b8be5da"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc14c651-9fc7-40b4-bc14-ac2afa9b8115", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5e6ccbf97865bb68d526fb237a7bb6c710a2fd3b5680bb00f4c161928207975c"}}, "hash": "d6339a50ed39cfdb10e8ada0a76fbb2a00ed7f9388125989346d3933916b65a9", "text": "79653 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nare not currently being met. For \nexample, if the PCP writes an order for blood pressure medication but then notes during a later assessment that the medication is not working, we would expect the PCP and the IDT to consider alternative medications or treatments that might better meet the participant\u2019s needs. \nWe propose to redesignate current \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii) as \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iii) and add the title \u2018\u2018Documenting Recommended Services\u2019\u2019 for improved readability. No further modifications are proposed for this provision. \nWe propose to add \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv) \nto require the IDT to review, assess, and act on recommendations from emergency or urgent care providers following participant discharge, and employees and contractors, including medical specialists. As discussed earlier, the IDT is responsible for authorizing, approving and ordering all care, including care recommended from contracted providers. This means that a participant may not receive necessary care until the IDT considers and approves or authorizes those recommendations that were made by the provider or specialist. Through monitoring and oversight activities, we have identified instances where the IDT is not promptly reviewing recommendations from urgent and emergency care providers, as well as employees and contractors. Based on data collected during the 2021 audits, approximately 75 percent of audited PACE organizations were cited based on a failure to review and act on recommendations from specialists in a manner necessary to meet the needs of the participant. Delayed review of recommendations and action on recommendations can delay the provision of necessary care and services, and can jeopardize participant health and safety. To address these concerns, we propose timeframes for the IDT to review and take action on recommendations from urgent and emergency care providers, as well as employees and contractors. As we stated in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 6132), we do not believe we could implement a specific timeframe for the provision of services, given the vast array of services that PACE organizations provide and variation in individual participant needs. However, we believe requiring the IDT to promptly act on recommendations from urgent and emergency care providers, as well as employees and contractors, creates accountability for expeditious service delivery while offering \nflexibility for wide ranges of services and variation in urgency. The timeframes we propose at \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv)(A) through (C) would be maximum timeframes within which the IDT must review, assess and determine whether service recommendations from urgent and emergency care providers, as well as employees and contractors, are necessary to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, social, or emotional needs, and if so, promptly arrange and furnish the service in accordance with the timeframes at \u00a7 460.98(c). Under \u00a7 460.98(b)(4) (which we propose to redesignate as \u00a7 460.98(c)(4)), PACE organizations must continue to provide services as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s health condition requires, taking into account the participant\u2019s medical, physical, social, and emotional needs. In order to meet the participant\u2019s needs, the IDT may need to review and act on recommendations sooner than the timeframes proposed in \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv). Nothing in \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv) would require the IDT to approve all recommendations; however, we would expect that the IDT review, assess, and act on the recommendation. That action would either be to either make a determination to approve or provide the recommended service or make a determination to not approve or provide the recommended service. If the IDT makes a determination to approve or provide a service, it must arrange and schedule the service in accordance with \u00a7 460.98(c). If the IDT makes a determination not to approve or provide a service, we would expect the IDT to document the reason(s) for not approving or providing the recommended care or services in accordance with current \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(ii), which, as previously noted, we propose to redesignate as \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iii) and \u00a7 460.210(b). \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv)(A) \nto establish that the appropriate member(s) of the IDT must review all recommendations from hospitals, emergency departments, and urgent care providers and determine if the recommended services are necessary to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, social, or emotional needs within 24 hours from the time of the participant\u2019s discharge.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc14c651-9fc7-40b4-bc14-ac2afa9b8115": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc14c651-9fc7-40b4-bc14-ac2afa9b8115", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e2d50c7-7a22-470a-8963-371c7f140f41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0ffac36a55293c6716656843275acff9053502a4784f473f253773801b8be5da"}, "2": {"node_id": "9647adc6-be0b-488f-b5d2-ceccf457292a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d6339a50ed39cfdb10e8ada0a76fbb2a00ed7f9388125989346d3933916b65a9"}}, "hash": "5e6ccbf97865bb68d526fb237a7bb6c710a2fd3b5680bb00f4c161928207975c", "text": "We considered multiple factors when proposing a 24-hour timeframe. We believe the 24-hour timeframe is necessary and reasonable due to the following considerations. First, this timeframe would be limited to only those recommendations made by hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care providers, and it would not apply to recommendations made by other providers or more routine appointments. Second, we considered that PACE is responsible for the needs of the participant 24 hours a day, every day of the year. When a participant is discharged from one of these settings there may be recommendations made or care needed, that cannot wait until the next business day. For example, a participant who is discharged from the hospital on a Saturday with a recommendation for antibiotics should not have to wait until Monday to have their prescription ordered or approved by the IDT. Third, we are proposing to not require that the full IDT be involved in assessing and acting on these recommendations, but rather the appropriate member(s) of the team as determined by the IDT. We do not anticipate that the full IDT would need to be involved in all decisions relating to recommendations made by hospitals or urgent care centers. It would likely be 1 or 2 IDT members that would ultimately be responsible for these recommendations and therefore a shorter timeframe is reasonable. For example, for the post discharge recommendation for antibiotics previously described, the IDT PCP may be the only discipline required to review and act on the medication request, since the PCP is responsible for ordering care and medications.

While we do not believe that all \nrecommendations made by all types of employees and contractors need to be responded to as quickly as recommendations from hospitals, urgent care providers, or emergency departments, we do believe the IDT must act promptly to consider the recommendations made, and, when the IDT deems the recommended care necessary, it must authorize the care. The proposed 5-day timeframe would represent the maximum amount of time a PACE organization would have to determine whether a recommended service is necessary, and we would expect the IDT to consider the participant\u2019s condition in determining whether it is necessary to make a determination sooner than 5 days after the recommendation is made. Additionally, we propose that the timeframe would begin when the recommendation is made, not when the recommendation is received by the IDT. We have seen through monitoring instances of PACE organizations not making initial requests for consult notes from a participant\u2019s appointment with a specialist until months after the appointment has taken place, and only learning at that time that a recommendation was made during the appointment. It is important that the PACE organization promptly act on recommendations, and it is our expectation that they develop processes with their employees and contractors to ensure the IDT is receiving recommendations in a manner that allows the IDT to determine the necessity of the recommended services within the proposed timeframe. We invite comment on alternative maximum timeframes for IDT review of all recommendations from other employees and contractors and to make a determination on the recommendation\u2019s necessity. We are particularly interested in commenters\u2019 perspectives on whether we should adopt a 3 calendar day timeframe, a 7 calendar day timeframe, or a 10 calendar day timeframe. We request that commenters address how the alternative timeframes would ensure participant health and safety. \nWe propose to establish at \n\u00a7 460.102(d)(1)(iv)(C) that, if recommendations are authorized or approved by the IDT or a member of the IDT, the services must be promptly arranged and furnished under \u00a7 460.98(c), as proposed. As discussed in section VI.G. of this proposed rule, we are proposing timeframes for the IDT to promptly arrange and schedule services that are authorized, ordered or approved by the IDT or a member of the IDT. If a recommendation is made by a contractor or an employee, and the IDT or a member of the IDT approves or orders that recommended service, we would expect the PACE organization to arrange and schedule the service in accordance with the proposed regulations at \u00a7 460.98(c). We are proposing distinct timeframes depending on the facts and circumstances of the situation and the service at issue. For example, if a hospital, at the time of discharge, makes a recommendation for a medication, the appropriate members of the IDT would have 24 hours to act on the recommendation, and if approved and ordered by the PCP, another 24 hours to arrange for the medication to be dispensed under proposed \u00a7 460.98(c)(1). In this scenario, because the recommendation is being made by a hospital, the timeframe to act on the recommendation is 24 hours under the proposal at \u00a7 460.102(d)(iv)(A), and because the recommended service is a medication, the timeframe to arrange the service is 24 hours from the date of the order under the proposal at \u00a7 460.98(c)(1). If a specialist recommends a medication, then the IDT would have 5 calendar days to make a determination with respect to the recommendation, and if it is approved and ordered, 24 hours to arrange for the medication to be dispensed. If a recommendation is made from a contractor such as a medical specialist for a service that is not a medication, the IDT would have 5 calendar days to consider and act on the recommendation, and then, if approved or authorized, the PACE organization would have 7 calendar days to arrange or schedule the approved or authorized service. \nThe timeframe to schedule the service \nwould begin the day the IDT or a member of the IDT approves or authorizes the recommendation. We emphasize again that these timeframes are maximum timeframes that the IDT and PACE organization should consider when reviewing recommendations. For some recommendations, such as an MRI to be done in 3 months, these timeframes would be sufficient to ensure that the service is approved and arranged before the service is needed. However, there are other recommendations made where it would not be appropriate for the IDT to take a full 12 calendar days to assess and act on a recommendation, and then arrange and schedule it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f840014-7856-4ee0-b96c-fdbdf1f005af": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f840014-7856-4ee0-b96c-fdbdf1f005af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e418f285-7bab-42f5-b8ec-94c59ed41fc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "65c1bac45d2bee168d331d79de9f4711ffba04ffabb04fcd42f27fe73747a08f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3a83159-762c-40a6-bef6-522ecc6088e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "218d4775f2a218e3e3e238ce470e4741cc3322409471873179c657d79d5669e7"}}, "hash": "45e1558b9ea15b17d0566b825b6a208b5aa7652eefa8f2aa8ae45c88a36e1603", "text": "For example, if a cardiologist indicated that the participant needed an urgent coronary artery bypass graft, we would expect \nthat the IDT and PACE organization act upon that information in a more expeditious manner. \nWe are not scoring this provision in \nthe Regulatory Impact Analysis section because the IDT is already required to comprehensively assess and meet the individual needs of each participant, including ensuring the participant\u2019s access to all necessary covered items and services 24 hours per day, every day of the year.

The care planning document also provided guidance on interdisciplinary team involvement in the plan of care and what content or care should be included in the participant\u2019s plan of care. While this document stressed that care plans should be comprehensive and include the participants medical, physical, social and emotional needs; it also noted that not all care received by the participant would need to be included in the care plan, and instead, could be tracked and documented through discipline specific progress notes. The guidance stated that, \u2018\u2018Each PACE organization must define what care is integrated into the participant\u2019s plan of care, and what discipline-specific care is appropriately documented and monitored by the respective discipline specialist in the progress notes.\u2019\u2019\n221 \nSince that time, CMS has seen \nthrough oversight and monitoring efforts that participant care plans are often sparse and may not fully detail the care received by a participant. We have noted that organizations are relying heavily on providing and documenting care through discipline-specific progress notes, rather than through incorporation into a more comprehensive and formal plan of care. \nIn the June 2019 final rule (84 FR \n25675), CMS added additional requirements around the development of a comprehensive plan of care. As part of the modifications made during the June 2019 final rule, we added at \u00a7 460.104(b) the requirement that within 30 days of the date of enrollment, the IDT must consolidate discipline-specific assessments into a single plan of care for each participant through team discussions and consensus of the entire IDT. The June 2019 final rule also added \u00a7 460.104(b)(1), which provides that if, in developing the plan of care, the IDT determines that certain services are not necessary to the care of a participant, the reasoning behind this determination must be documented in the plan of care. CMS explained in the June 2019 final rule that if the IDT does not believe a PACE participant needs a certain service as it relates to the IDT care plan assessment findings and, therefore, does not authorize that service, the IDT must document the rationale for not including the service in the plan of care (84 FR 25643). CMS also noted that we would expect the plan of care to reflect that the participant was assessed for all services, even where a determination is made that certain services were unnecessary at the time (Id.). \nIn addition to the modifications at \n\u00a7 460.104(b), in the June 2019 final rule, CMS also amended \u00a7 460.106 in order to provide additional clarity with respect to the development and content of the plan of care process (84 FR 25646). Among other changes, CMS added at \u00a7 460.106(b) three new requirements related to the interventions that must be included in a participant\u2019s plan of care. Specifically, CMS added requirements for PACE organizations to utilize the most appropriate interventions for each care need that advance the participant toward a measurable goal and outcome (\u00a7 460.106(b)(3)); identify each intervention and how it will be implemented (\u00a7 460.106(b)(4)); and identify how each intervention will be evaluated to determine progress in reaching specified goals and desired outcomes (\u00a7 460.106(b)(5)). \nDespite the addition of these \nrequirements in the June 2019 final rule, we continue to find that PACE organizations are struggling with developing, implementing, monitoring, reevaluating, and revising plans of care.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abf72763-1db7-48f7-a9e8-73fbe8d821f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "abf72763-1db7-48f7-a9e8-73fbe8d821f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0b704e5-78b7-4b2a-a2d8-0153d48e8e4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2e40b3b563edfc434729185bbf6674d235f3adea7ebffa9cb9f9409b40bc4e71"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cc000be-3803-42f6-b2cb-c6946fabd35e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "48a5bdc916cf0eb3b880834a76e254dce70be5725955b25f8592beaddf58599a"}}, "hash": "6a10acc4ad833a63470d2a26ba6261e13a373e822fbaa976850c1e6748d6bb55", "text": "While the addition of \u00a7 460.104(b)(1) has helped organizations create more robust initial care plans for participants, we have seen through our oversight and monitoring process that these care plans become more sparse over time, and care initially included in the plan of care will be omitted in subsequent revisions and handled through discipline-specific progress notes as the participant\u2019s enrollment continues. We acknowledge that documenting detailed information about participant care and services in discipline-specific progress notes is necessary and an accepted standard practice; however, this should not be done in lieu of a comprehensive plan of care that addresses the participant\u2019s needs. The purpose of a plan of care is \nto allow the different IDT disciplines to discuss a participant\u2019s needs and develop interventions and goals, as a team. The IDT approach to care management and service delivery is a statutory requirement, and is one of the requirements that is essential to the PACE program and cannot be waived (see section 1894(f)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act). \nAs we explained in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71285), we believe a well- functioning IDT is critical to the success of the PACE program as the team is instrumental in controlling the delivery, quality, and continuity of care. Members of the IDT should be knowledgeable about the overall needs of the participant, not just the needs that relate to their individual disciplines. In order to meet all of the health, psychosocial, and functional needs of the participant, team members must view the participant in a holistic manner and focus on a comprehensive care approach. By handling care through discipline-specific progress notes, the team role in discussing and monitoring that care is removed, and individual team members provide care in a more isolated and individualized approach. The plan of care is a tool that allows the IDT to assess a participant holistically, and develop interventions and goals that may cross disciplines. We also believe that failing to develop comprehensive plans of care poses a risk to participants enrolled in PACE organizations by making it harder for the organization to track and monitor the provision of services. When information is documented throughout a medical record in discipline-specific progress notes, instead of being consolidated in a single comprehensive plan of care, it prevents employees and contractors from quickly or easily locating necessary information and, as a result, may contribute to care not being provided as necessary or in a timely manner. Since the June 2019 final rule became effective, CMS has completed 40 PACE audits and we have identified a failure to provide services or delays in providing services in 37 of the 40 audits conducted. Although this non- compliance cannot be directly attributed to a failure to consolidate information into a comprehensive plan of care, our audit findings suggests that the coordination and delivery of necessary services is a challenge for PACE organizations. \nFinally, in addition to seeing concerns \nrelated to the content of care plans, we have also seen on audit that participant and caregiver involvement in the care planning process tends to be minimal and primarily occurs after the development and/or revisions to the plan of care have been finalized and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00205 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd855fc6-0ec3-4d32-bbae-7784b9d7fac2": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd855fc6-0ec3-4d32-bbae-7784b9d7fac2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09b2c976-1f7e-4f2c-90d8-f8c70d86124a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "30874d0385b5e4a28ab9b66930ac06f1a6cc6597d2c861bc79ba8cba7eeef857"}, "3": {"node_id": "5de35fe6-0d80-4e5d-b38d-acb54be67381", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "89a574da5dfa6872838faabb8699a0bdd8731aa6740192c9f11e1ccfd41e7665"}}, "hash": "ebee2dffde1fd0693c2119d7bbcb6107d8fddd4e6420fa21867cc9a3de8ad7be", "text": "79656 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nimplemented by the IDT. In the 1999 \nPACE interim final rule (64 FR 66252), CMS specifically stated that plans of care must be developed, reviewed, and reevaluated in collaboration with the participants or caregivers. The purpose of participant/caregiver involvement is to ensure that they approve of the care plan and that participant concerns are addressed. Furthermore, in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71293), CMS reiterated that it is our expectation that the IDT will include the participant in the plan of care development when possible and include the participant\u2019s representative when it is not appropriate to include the participant or at the instruction of the participant. We continue to believe that participant and caregiver involvement in the development, review, and reevaluation of the plan of care is necessary to ensure participants\u2019 needs are fully met. \nAs a result of our experience \noverseeing PACE organizations, we believe it is prudent to implement additional requirements related to the minimum requirements for a participant\u2019s plan of care, including: further defining the timeframes for care plan development and reevaluation, defining the minimum content that should be reflected in a plan of care, emphasizing the ongoing responsibilities of the IDT to monitor and revise the plan of care to determine its effectiveness, and defining the involvement of the participant and/or their caregiver in the plan of care before it is finalized. In developing these proposed requirements, we attempted to adopt language and requirements that are consistent with the long-term care facility regulation at \u00a7 483.21(b), when possible. The regulation at \u00a7 483.21(b) requires nursing facilities to develop comprehensive and person-centered care plans that meet residents\u2019 needs and identify the services necessary to meet those needs. Individuals who enroll in PACE must be deemed as nursing home eligible; therefore, individuals who enroll in PACE and individuals who receive services from nursing facilities have similar needs. Additionally, while PACE organizations are insurers, they are also direct care providers. Since nursing homes are also direct care providers, and serve a similar population, aligning care planning requirements across these programs is an important safeguard for participants, and will improve the PACE organization\u2019s ability to meet participants\u2019 needs and to deliver necessary services for this vulnerable \npopulation. \nFirst, we propose to modify the \nrequirement in \u00a7 460.106(a) to require that the members of the IDT specified in \n\u00a7 460.102(b) must develop, evaluate, and if necessary, revise a person- centered plan of care for each participant. This is consistent with the requirement at \u00a7 460.104(b) that states that within 30 days of the date of enrollment, the IDT must consolidate discipline-specific assessments into a single plan of care for each participant through team discussions and consensus of the entire IDT. Additionally, the IDT is required to reevaluate the plan of care on a semi- annual basis at the current \u00a7 460.106(d); however, we are proposing to remove that requirement as our proposal at \u00a7 460.106(a) would cover the role of the IDT in both the initial care plan development and also the subsequent reviews and reevaluations of the care plan. We are also proposing to add language into \u00a7 460.106(a) that would require each plan of care to take into consideration the most current assessment findings and identify the services to be furnished to attain or maintain the participant\u2019s highest practicable level of well-being. As we will discuss in Section VI.J. of this proposed rule, since PACE is a direct care provider, serving nursing home eligible participants, we also considered nursing home regulations as we drafted this proposal. The nursing home regulations require that care plans must describe \u2018\u2018the services that are to be furnished to attain or maintain the resident\u2019s highest practicable physical, mental, and psych-social well-being\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 483.21(b)(1)(i)). This language should also apply to PACE care plans, since they serve the same nursing home eligible population. \nNext, we propose to add a new \nsection, \u00a7 460.106(b), which would define the specific timeframes for developing, evaluating, and revising care plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5de35fe6-0d80-4e5d-b38d-acb54be67381": {"__data__": {"id_": "5de35fe6-0d80-4e5d-b38d-acb54be67381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09b2c976-1f7e-4f2c-90d8-f8c70d86124a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "30874d0385b5e4a28ab9b66930ac06f1a6cc6597d2c861bc79ba8cba7eeef857"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd855fc6-0ec3-4d32-bbae-7784b9d7fac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ebee2dffde1fd0693c2119d7bbcb6107d8fddd4e6420fa21867cc9a3de8ad7be"}}, "hash": "89a574da5dfa6872838faabb8699a0bdd8731aa6740192c9f11e1ccfd41e7665", "text": "For initial care plans, we intend to maintain the requirement for the IDT to finalize the development of the initial plan of care within 30 calendar days of the participant\u2019s enrollment that is located at current \u00a7 460.106(a), but we propose to move this requirement to new section \u00a7 460.106(b)(1). \nThe regulation at \u00a7 460.106(d) \ncurrently requires the IDT to reevaluate the plan of care, including defined outcomes, and make changes as necessary on at least a semi-annual basis. The interpretation of the semi- annual timeframe has posed issues for PACE organizations. We therefore propose at \u00a7 460.106(b)(2) to require that the IDT must complete a reevaluation \nof, and if necessary, revisions to each participant\u2019s plan of care at least once every 180 calendar days. We believe \nthat creating a strict timeframe of 180 days would be less ambiguous and easier for organizations to track. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(b)(3)(i) that \nthe IDT must complete a reevaluation, and if necessary, revisions of the plan of care within 14 calendar days after the PACE organization determines, or should have determined, that there has been a change in the participant\u2019s health or psychosocial status or more expeditiously if the participant\u2019s condition requires. Currently, the members of the IDT specified in \u00a7 460.104(d)(1) must conduct reassessments when a participant experiences a change in participant status. Additionally, the IDT members that conduct a reassessment must also reevaluate the participant\u2019s plan of care (see \u00a7 460.104(e)(1)) and discuss any changes in the plan with the IDT (see \u00a7 460.104(e)(2)). However, there is no timeframe for how quickly the IDT members must conduct those reassessments or reevaluate the plan of care to determine if changes are needed. We believe that a 14-calendar day timeframe is appropriate since it will ensure the IDT is promptly acting on changes to the participant\u2019s status. In considering an appropriate timeframe, we reviewed the nursing home requirements. The long-term care regulations at \u00a7 483.20(b)(2)(ii) require that the resident receive a comprehensive assessment within 14 calendar days after the date the facility determines, or should have determined, that there has been a significant change in the resident\u2019s physical or mental condition. The long-term care facility must then use the results of the assessments to develop, review and revise the resident\u2019s comprehensive plan of care (see \u00a7 483.20(d)). This is an appropriate standard to apply in PACE as well, since as we have previously discussed, participants in PACE are deemed nursing home eligible, and therefore their conditions are substantially similar to the conditions a nursing home resident experiences. As discussed later in this section of this proposed rule, we are also proposing to modify \u00a7 460.104(e) to emphasize that all required assessments must be completed prior to the plan of care being revised. Therefore, this 14- calendar day timeframe would include both the required assessments under \u00a7 460.104(d)(1) and the process of revising the plan of care under \u00a7 460.106. \nWe propose to specify at \n\u00a7 460.106(b)(3)(i) that the 14-calendar \nday timeframe starts when the PACE organization determines, or should have \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00206 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0f7e3e-23f7-4788-ad21-ea4e7015ba0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0f7e3e-23f7-4788-ad21-ea4e7015ba0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "499022d6-5deb-490c-8907-98da65fd292b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "30e6d414f3c312be1426ce1472008d979d6299d937aff62b2dd2a5ba0d94e330"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf0e0916-7a22-4f50-af8f-c8d5eff13095", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "41020c2ad47941b5470027d7ec73416f46004cf6efd3c92f5da9157fc7b1c577"}}, "hash": "cf7d06204f7678cc1b742e0a952839eb6ba8d725cdb7037fec5959af1c615cf1", "text": "79657 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \ndetermined, that a change in the \nparticipant\u2019s condition occurs. This requirement would align with long-term care regulations for when the timeframe begins following a participant\u2019s (or resident\u2019s) change in condition. If a participant experiences a change in status that triggers this reassessment and reevaluation of the care plan, the PACE organization should not be able to delay the timeframe by not recognizing the change in status for a period of time. We also propose to define at \u00a7 460.106(b)(3)(i) what constitutes a change in status. While the PACE regulations require assessments when a change in participant status occurs, what constitutes a change in status has not been previously defined. Like other proposed changes in this proposed rule, we are proposing to adopt in PACE the requirement applicable to nursing homes at \u00a7 483.20(b)(2)(ii), but we have tailored the language of the proposed regulation to be specific to PACE. For example, the proposed PACE regulation would refer to the \u2018\u2018participant\u2019\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018\u2018resident\u2019\u2019, which is the term used in the long-term care regulation, it would use the phrase \u2018\u2018change in participant status\u2019\u2019 where the long-term care regulation uses the phrase \u2018\u2018significant change\u2019\u2019. Therefore, the requirement as proposed would state that for purposes of this section, a \u2018\u2018change in participant status\u2019\u2019 means a major decline or improvement in the participant\u2019s status that will not normally resolve itself without further intervention by staff or by implementing standard disease-related clinical interventions, that has an impact on more than one area of the participant\u2019s health status, and requires IDT review or revision of the care plan, or both. The proposed change would bring additional consistency between the PACE and nursing home requirements and ensure similarly situated beneficiaries are treated equally. \nIn conjunction with the proposed \nrequirement that a PACE organization must reevaluate and, if necessary, revise the plan of care within 14 calendar days after a change in the participant\u2019s condition occurs, we propose at \u00a7 460.106(b)(3)(ii) that if a participant is hospitalized within 14 calendar days of the change in participant status, the IDT must complete a reevaluation of, and if necessary, revisions to the plan of care as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires but no later than 14 calendar days after the date of discharge from the hospital. We recognize that when a participant is hospitalized, it is difficult for the IDT to assess the participant, and revise a plan of care, during the course of that \nhospitalization. Given this complexity, we propose that the timeframe for reevaluating the plan of care starts when the participant is discharged from the hospital. Despite this proposed exception, we would remind PACE organizations that their responsibilities toward the participant do not end or stop when a participant is hospitalized, and the IDT should remain alert to pertinent information in all care settings under \u00a7 460.102(d)(2)(ii). \nWe solicit comment on whether 14 \ncalendar days is an appropriate timeframe to use. We also considered 21 or 30 calendar days, but were not persuaded to propose either, given the 14-day requirement in the nursing home regulations. However, are interested in commenters\u2019 feedback on whether 21 or 30 days would be more appropriate and, if so, why the timeframes for PACE and nursing homes should be different. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c) to make \ncertain modifications related to the content of a plan of care. Currently, the content of a plan of care is specified at \u00a7 460.106(b), which requires the care plan to include the care needed to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional and social needs; identify measurable outcomes to be achieved; utilize the most appropriate interventions for each care need that advances the participant toward a measurable goal; identify each intervention and how it will be implemented; and identify how each intervention will be evaluated to determine progress. We have seen as part of our audit and oversight activities where treatments for participants\u2019 medical conditions are included in discipline-specific notes, but not in the comprehensive care plan. This has resulted in members of the IDT being unaware of what treatments or recommendations the participant has received from different members of the IDT or from outside contracted specialists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0e0916-7a22-4f50-af8f-c8d5eff13095": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0e0916-7a22-4f50-af8f-c8d5eff13095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "499022d6-5deb-490c-8907-98da65fd292b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "30e6d414f3c312be1426ce1472008d979d6299d937aff62b2dd2a5ba0d94e330"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf0f7e3e-23f7-4788-ad21-ea4e7015ba0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "cf7d06204f7678cc1b742e0a952839eb6ba8d725cdb7037fec5959af1c615cf1"}}, "hash": "41020c2ad47941b5470027d7ec73416f46004cf6efd3c92f5da9157fc7b1c577", "text": "As a result, we have seen participants experience delays in receiving the recommended treatment or service, the treatment or service not being provided at all, and in some situations, duplicate orders for a service or treatment due to the IDT being unaware the service or treatment was previously provided. Therefore, in addition to proposing to move the content of plan of care requirements from \u00a7 460.106(b) to \u00a7 460.106(c), we propose to add language to the section to create minimum requirements for what each plan of care must include. When determining the minimum \ncontent a plan of care should include, we considered the care plans that nursing homes are required to create. \nSpecifically, we considered the regulations at \u00a7 483.21(b) which specify the requirements for a comprehensive plan of care. Additionally, \u00a7 483.21(b) makes reference to \u00a7 483.24 (Quality of Life), \u00a7 483.25 (Quality of Care), and \u00a7 483.40 (Behavior Health), so we considered those sections as well. Given the similarities between PACE participants and nursing home participants, our proposal aligns with the nursing home requirements to the extent we believe those requirements are applicable. Therefore, at \u00a7 460.106(c), we propose modifying the language to state at a minimum, each plan of care must meet certain requirements, which would be set forth in the regulations at proposed \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(i) through (xiii). At \u00a7 460.106(c)(1), we propose to add language that requires PACE organizations to identify all of the participant\u2019s current medical, physical, emotional, and social needs, including all needs associated with chronic diseases, behavioral disorders, and psychiatric disorders that require treatment or routine monitoring, and that at a minimum, the care plan must address specific factors we will discuss in the next paragraph. Care plans are currently required at \u00a7 460.106(b)(1) to include the care needed to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional and social needs, as identified in the initial comprehensive assessment. However, we are proposing to further specify that the plan of care should address all needs associated with chronic diseases, behavioral disorders, and psychiatric disorders that require treatment or routine monitoring. This is consistent with nursing home requirements since nursing homes must assess a resident\u2019s disease diagnoses and health conditions as part of the comprehensive assessment (see \u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(x)) and use those assessments in developing, reviewing and revising the plan of care (see \u00a7 483.20(d)). We believe our proposal related to chronic behavioral and psychiatric disorders is consistent with \nlong-term care requirements in \u00a7 483.40, which require that each resident must receive and the facility must provide the necessary behavioral health care and services. As we mentioned earlier, the nursing home care plan requirements at \u00a7 483.21(b) reference the behavior health requirements at \u00a7 483.40. Therefore, we propose that chronic behavioral and psychiatric disorders that require treatment or routine monitoring also be included in PACE plans of care. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00207 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1015f0d1-2a6b-413e-aec0-e49d3985d08f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1015f0d1-2a6b-413e-aec0-e49d3985d08f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bcf72fe4-1a88-450b-bc95-19c696c9b293", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4ca830ff4cad6bc3002e7e57f7f948ef4cca7115262e2edd2c7064f4b408839b"}, "3": {"node_id": "e69339c5-62f2-492a-a54c-20230bc55319", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0c09776161148144948f1469383760b90cce4782c70c968f9d2028ce2f0f139f"}}, "hash": "5c88e7d2163d4edb8304067934841f5613cb69014c6ae717b2d3f18673f95b59", "text": "79658 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n222Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n(2022, May 6). About Chronic Diseases. Retrieved \nfrom: https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/ \nindex.htm. While the nursing home assessment \ncriteria require consideration and \nassessment of all disease diagnoses and health conditions, we are proposing in PACE to limit what diseases must be included in the plan of care to those that are chronic and require treatment or routine monitoring. For example, if a \nparticipant had Hepatitis C but was treated and cured, that disease may not need to be included in the plan of care. On the other hand, if a participant has coronary artery disease and requires ongoing monitoring by a cardiologist, we would expect that disease to be included in the plan of care. When considering how organizations would define \u2018\u2018chronic\u2019\u2019 we believe that most organizations would consider the guidance issued by the CDC, which defines chronic diseases as conditions that last 1 year or more, and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both.\n222We \nalso considered whether it would be appropriate for the plan of care to address acute conditions, but decided that including acute conditions could make the care plan subject to more modifications than what is feasible for the IDT. For example, if the care plan needed to be updated for every infection, the care plan may be under a constant state of revision. However, we solicit comment on whether acute conditions should be included in the minimum content that a care plan must address. \nWe propose to specify at \n\u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(i) that the PACE participant\u2019s plan of care must address the participant\u2019s vision needs. This is consistent with the long-term care provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(v) and 483.25(a). Given the age of the PACE population, and the co-morbidities that may impact this population (such as diabetes), addressing a participant\u2019s vision needs is an important part of any plan of care. We similarly propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(ii) that a PACE participant\u2019s plan of care must address the participant\u2019s hearing needs. This is consistent with the long-term care regulations at \u00a7 483.25(a). We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(iii) that a participant\u2019s plan of care must address the participant\u2019s dentition. This would be consistent with the requirement at \u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(xi). We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(iv) that a plan of care must address the participant\u2019s skin integrity. This requirement would be consistent with the requirements at \u00a7\u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(xii) and 483.25(b). We \npropose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(v) that the participant\u2019s plan of care must address the participant\u2019s mobility. This requirement would be consistent with the requirement at \u00a7 483.25(c). We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(vi) that the participant\u2019s plan of care must address the participant\u2019s physical functioning (including activities of daily living). This would be consistent with the requirements at \u00a7\u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(viii) and 483.24(b). We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(vii) that the plan of care must address the participant\u2019s pain management needs. This would be consistent with the requirement at \u00a7 483.25(k). \nThe next few proposed requirements \ndeviate from the nursing home requirements and are tailored specifically to the PACE program. We propose to require at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(viii) that the plan of care address the participant\u2019s nutrition, including access to meals that meet the participant\u2019s daily nutritional and special dietary needs. This proposed language is based on the long-term care regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 483.20(b)(1)(xi), 483.24(b)(4), and 483.25(g), but it is tailored to be more specific to PACE.

While the PACE organization is responsible for ensuring that participants\u2019 nutritional needs are met per the regulations at \u00a7 460.78, the exact manner in which the organization meets that requirement may be different for each participant. As we stated in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71281), the PACE organization is responsible for a participant\u2019s health and safety including his or her nutritional needs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The IDT must assess the participant\u2019s needs as well as his or her access to adequate nutrition. The participant\u2019s nutritional requirements and dietary needs should be included in the plan of care, whether it is providing tube feedings, arranging for Meals on Wheels, sending meals home with the participant, or documenting that appropriate meals are provided by the family/caregiver. For this reason, we are including in proposed \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(viii) language that would specify that the plan of care address not only nutrition, but also how a participant accesses meals that meet their nutritional and special dietary \nneeds. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(ix) to \nestablish the requirement that the plan of care address the participant\u2019s ability \nto live safely in the community, including the safety of their home environment. This proposal also deviates from the nursing home requirements, as the goal of PACE is to keep nursing home eligible individuals out of a facility and living in the community. In order to accomplish that goal, the IDT must assess the participant\u2019s environment and living situation for potential factors that may make it not safe for the participant. For example, if the PACE organization recognizes the participant does not have a means of contacting either the PACE organization or emergency services, the PACE organization should address that concern as part of the plan of care, and provide the participant with a method of contacting those individuals or \nentities. As we noted in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71275), PACE organizations are at risk for all health care services the participant receives and; therefore, we expect PACE organizations will be involved in assuring the health and safety of participants at all times, including when they are at home. We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(x) that the plan of care must address the participant\u2019s home care needs. This proposal would also deviate from nursing home guidance; however, we believe it to be important in the PACE model. The nursing home is responsible for 24-hour care similar to PACE, but inherently provides all care as part of the resident living at the facility. PACE often provides similar care, for example medication administration, through home care services. Therefore, we believe a participant\u2019s home care needs must be addressed through the plan of care. We propose to establish at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(xi) that the participant\u2019s center attendance must be included in the plan of care. Again, while not a requirement in nursing homes, center attendance is an integral part of the PACE program, and we believe it is appropriate to include it in a participant\u2019s plan of care. We propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(xii) to require that a participant\u2019s transportation needs be incorporated into the plan of care. Transportation is an essential part of the PACE benefit, as often it is the PACE transportation that ensures participants have access to their necessary medical appointments and specialist visits. In addition, we propose to require at \u00a7 460.106(c)(1)(xiii) that a participant\u2019s communication needs (including any identified language barriers) be incorporated into the plan of care.

Along with any general comments that are submitted, we are specifically requesting comment on whether to include acute diseases and/or acute behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the plan of care. We contemplated adding acute diseases as part of the minimum criteria for the plan of care, but ultimately, we believe it might be hard to operationalize. When submitting comments on whether acute diseases should be included in the plan of care, we ask that commenters also indicate whether they believe the term \u2018\u2018acute diseases\u2019\u2019 should be defined in the PACE regulations, and if so, how. We also solicit comment on whether there is other content that is required to be in a nursing home care plan that should also be included in a PACE plan of care. We are particularly interested in feedback that addresses whether we should include incontinence care and dialysis care as required content for PACE plans of care. (Both incontinence care and dialysis care are required in nursing home care plans, per the regulations at \u00a7 483.25(e) and (l)). \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(2) to \nrequire that the plan of care must identify each intervention (the care or service) needed to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional, and social needs. In addition to identifying the needs of the participant as they relate to the proposed criteria in \u00a7 460.106(c)(1), the PACE organization must also identify any service that will be provided in response to those needs. PACE organizations are currently required at \u00a7 460.106(b)(4) to identify each intervention, so this provision is consistent with the current requirement, but further emphasizes that it\u2019s any intervention needed to meet the participant\u2019s medical, physical, social or emotional needs. For example, if the participant has poor vision, the IDT may deem it necessary to provide glasses and routine trips to the optometrist or ophthalmologist. The IDT would need to identify these services in the plan of care. We propose to include at \u00a7 460.106(c)(2) an exception to the interventions that need to be included in the plan of care; specifically, proposed \u00a7 460.106(c)(2) would provide \nthat the plan of care does not need to identify the medications needed to meet a participant\u2019s needs if a comprehensive \nlist of medications is already documented elsewhere in the medical record. As we define services at \u00a7 460.6 to include medications, we strongly believe that medications are an important part of the PACE benefit, and may be the most applicable service for a particular diagnosis or condition. However, we also understand that medications may change frequently, especially when a participant is first beginning a medication routine, and are typically documented in the medical record in way that would allow the IDT to understand all current, pending and discontinued medications; therefore, we are not inclined to require medications to be included in the plan of care. However, while we are not proposing to require that all medications be identified in the plan of care, nothing would prohibit an organization from choosing to include medications in the care plan. We are soliciting comment on this proposal and whether the plan of care should include a comprehensive list of active medications. \nWe propose to redesignate current \n\u00a7 460.106(b)(3), which requires the care plan to utilize the most appropriate interventions for each care need that advances the participant toward a measurable goal and outcome, as \u00a7 460.106(c)(3). \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(4) to \nspecify that the plan of care must identify how each service will be implemented, including a timeframe for implementation. The IDT is already required to identify how each intervention will be implemented in \u00a7 460.106(b)(4), however we are proposing to modify the language to specify that as part of identifying how the intervention will be implemented, the PACE organization should specify a timeframe for that implementation. As part of the plan of care process, the IDT should determine the parameters of a service, specifically how it will be provided to the participant in order to meet their needs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a931201-9740-4eb1-a3bc-1f75fb8824a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a931201-9740-4eb1-a3bc-1f75fb8824a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dcbfca19-8591-4b63-a6e3-41324dc730e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fa4b303a83d4fb5c71a03b0a74fb9d22a3fe667d576e96c6f07894c7249a1ae7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f720bc9e-8b75-4c5f-8c65-1edb1e0e2765", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5833d301fbb8b6537b42d5497658c815220d90f0be09e46cd3859647c0f04986"}}, "hash": "be35bebc0ba3d0a25fff964ab26969120f9b4a5a9aa9159a115f589b04d2690d", "text": "For example, it is not enough for the IDT to decide that the participant needs physical therapy. They should also discuss how often the participant should receive physical therapy, when it should be provided, and by whom. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(5) to \nrequire that the plan of care must \nidentify a measurable goal for each intervention. The current care plan regulations require that the plan identify measurable outcomes (\u00a7 460.106(b)(2)), and utilize appropriate interventions that advance the participant toward a measurable goal (\u00a7 460.106(b)(3)). Our proposal at \u00a7 460.106(c)(5) is consistent with the intention of the current \nrequirement; however, we believe the specificity of identifying measurable goals for each service are necessary. We believe that it is important when identifying a service to also identify the measurable goal for that service. Using the aforementioned example of physical therapy, we believe the IDT must determine what measurable goal the participant should achieve as a result of attending physical therapy. For example, the goal may be the participant\u2019s increased mobility demonstrated by the participant ambulating a specific distance either determined by an actual measurement (for example, 100 feet) or from one area of a room to another (for example. the participant will ambulate from the bed to the toilet without falling). \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(6) to \nrequire that the care plan identify how the goal for each intervention will be evaluated to determine whether the intervention should be continued, discontinued, or modified. The IDT is currently required at \u00a7 460.106(b)(5) to identify how each intervention will be evaluated to determine progress in reaching specified goals and desired outcomes. While our proposal is similar in intent, it would reduce ambiguity by specifying that the evaluation by the IDT should be focused on whether the goal was met for determining whether the intervention needs to be continued, discontinued or modified. For example, the IDT determines that the PACE participant should receive physical therapy 3 times a week. The goal may be that the participant is able to ambulate independently 100 feet. The IDT may determine the appropriate timeframe for that goal is 6 weeks. At the time the PACE organization identifies the measurable goal, it must determine how it will evaluate the participant\u2019s success in meeting the goal. In this example, at the end of the 6-week timeframe, the PACE organization should have a mechanism to determine if the participant has met the goal of ambulating 100 feet. If the participant met the goal, the IDT may determine the intervention can be discontinued. If the participant has not met the goal, the IDT may determine whether the intervention needs to be modified or if it should be continued for another set period of time, at which point the IDT will need to determine a new measurable goal and how it will be evaluated. \nFinally, we propose at \u00a7 460.106(c)(7) \nto require that the plan of care must identify the participant\u2019s preferences \nand goals of care.

We propose to move these requirements to \u00a7 460.106(d) and make modifications to the existing requirements. Currently, \u00a7 460.106(c)(1) requires the team to implement, coordinate, and monitor the plan of care regardless of whether the services are furnished by PACE employees or contractors. We propose to move this language to \u00a7 460.106(d)(1) and to modify it to read that the IDT must continuously implement, coordinate, and monitor the plan of care, regardless of whether the services are furnished by PACE employees or contractors, across all care settings. Through our audit and oversight activities, we have seen where PACE organizations met the minimum requirement of reassessing participants semiannually and updating the plan of care accordingly, but then took no further action with respect to the plan of care until the next semiannual assessment period. We want to reemphasize that the intent of the plan of care is to create a comprehensive, living document that is updated per the participant\u2019s current status at any given point; we are proposing to add the word \u2018\u2018continuously\u2019\u2019 to emphasize that the team must continue to be responsible for implementing, coordinating and monitoring the plan of care. We are proposing to include language specifying that this implementation, coordination and monitoring of the plan of care must be done across all care settings, to reiterate the responsibilities of the IDT in ensuring that care is appropriately coordinated and furnished, regardless of where a participant resides. For example, if a participant is living in a nursing home, that does not absolve the IDT of its responsibility to ensure that the care is implemented appropriately and that the participant\u2019s needs are met. \nCurrently, \u00a7 460.106(c)(2) requires the \nIDT to continuously monitor the participant\u2019s health and psychosocial status, as well as the effectiveness of the plan of care, through the provision of services, informal observation, input from participants or caregivers, and communications among members of the IDT. We propose to move the current requirements at \u00a7 460.106(c)(2) to \u00a7 460.106(d)(2) and to modify \u00a7 460.106(d)(2) to specify that the IDT \nmust continuously evaluate and monitor the participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional, and social needs, as well as \nthe effectiveness of the plan of care, through the provision of services, informal observation, input from participants or caregivers, and communications among members of the IDT and other employees or contractors. The proposed modification to change the language from \u2018\u2018participant\u2019s health and psychosocial status\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018participant\u2019s medical, physical, emotional, and social needs\u2019\u2019 is intended to align more closely with the regulation on required services at \u00a7 460.92(b). \nWe propose to add \u00a7 460.106(d)(3) to \nstate that all services must be arranged and provided in accordance with \u00a7 460.98(c). The provision of care planned services is an important part of implementing the plan of care. As we discussed in section VI.G. of this rule, we have proposed additional criteria concerning the arranging and provision of services that are determined necessary by the IDT. When a service is care planned, the IDT has determined that the service is necessary for the participant, and we would expect it to be arranged and provided in accordance with the rules governing other approved or necessary services. \nCurrently, \u00a7 460.106(e) requires that \nthe team must develop, review, and reevaluate the plan of care in collaboration with the participant or caregiver, or both, to ensure that there is agreement with the plan of care and that the participant\u2019s concerns are addressed. We have seen as part of our audit and oversight activities where participants and/or caregivers are unaware of the contents of their plan of care or what services they should be receiving. We have also seen that the involvement of the participant and/or caregiver in the plan of care is often limited, and often reflects no direct involvement or input in that decision- making process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaf14a9b-5c37-48bb-be76-2426e67b6e3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaf14a9b-5c37-48bb-be76-2426e67b6e3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3999dffc-0a0b-4d3c-93d5-5758223bbdec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8817902559dddd141b8b5c8d7e7e675aac2221660424a7b644d7e9fee040716b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8883a54-e2f7-45d8-921b-4011a1aa47da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "722e1a597ef2f1ab94a1a9ab8b68f6823b65b193a96d65695fd5ced320f45a8c"}}, "hash": "92c96f383922886377e7b3a5c423d1b8ed78c204c8afeb113d132d7d5355c4ec", "text": "Instead, we often see that the plan of care is finalized by the team and then provided or reviewed with the participant after the fact as a means of \u2018\u2018collaboration.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, we propose to split the existing language into two new paragraphs \u00a7 460.106(e)(1) and (e)(2). We propose at \u00a7 460.106(e)(1) that the IDT must develop, evaluate, and revise each plan of care in collaboration with the participant or caregiver, or both. We are proposing to amend the language to refer to \u2018\u2018each\u2019\u2019 plan of care in order to emphasize that this collaboration must be performed for every new plan of care, including the initial, semi-annual, and a revised plan of care as a result of a change in status. \nWe also propose at \u00a7 460.106(e)(2) that the IDT must review and discuss each plan of care with the participant and/or \ncaregiver before the plan of care is completed to ensure that there is agreement with the plan of care and the participant\u2019s concerns are addressed. We want to ensure the participant and/ or caregiver has an opportunity to voice concerns and ensure that any concerns are addressed in the proposed plan of care; therefore, our proposal addresses the expectation that the IDT discuss the plan of care with the participant prior to it being finalized. We believe a discussion about the plan of care, with the participant and/or caregiver, is the best way for the IDT to explain the care they believe is necessary, and receive input from the participant and/or caregiver about their wishes and concerns related to their care. \nCurrently, \u00a7 460.106(f) requires that \nthe team must document the plan of care, and any changes made to it, in the participant\u2019s medical record. As part of our audit and oversight activities, we have seen organizations have insufficient documentation related to participant plans of care. We often see minimum documentation related to whether a participant has met the goals set at the last assessment and any changes in the participant\u2019s status, but we do not see documentation of the conversations with the participant in the plan of care, including whether the participant disagreed with any part of the plan of care and whether those concerns were addressed. Therefore, we propose to modify the language in \u00a7 460.106(f) to state that the team must establish and implement a process to document and maintain records related to all requirements for the plan of care in the participant\u2019s medical record, and ensure that the most recent care plan is available to all employees and contractors within the organization as needed. This proposal is consistent with the current requirement, but ensures that the PACE organization understands that it must document all care planning requirements. Therefore, we would expect to see documentation that the appropriate members of the IDT were involved in care planning in accordance with \u00a7 460.106(a), the IDT met the timeframes for finalizing care plans in \u00a7 460.106(b), that the care plans included all required content in \u00a7 460.106(c), that the IDT implemented and monitored the plan of care in accordance with \u00a7 460.106(d), and that the participant and caregiver were appropriately involved in the care planning process in accordance with \u00a7 460.106(e). \nWe also propose certain modifications \nto \u00a7 460.104 to align with our proposed \namendment to \u00a7 460.106.

This includes the participant\u2019s right to considerate, respectful care and the right not to be discriminated against (\u00a7 460.112(a)); the right to receive accurate, easily understood information and to receive assistance in making informed health care decisions (\u00a7 460.112(b)); the right to access emergency services without prior authorization (\u00a7 460.112(d)); and the right to participate fully in decisions related to his or her treatment (\u00a7 460.112(e)). \nIn this proposed rule, CMS is \nproposing to amend \u00a7 460.112 to incorporate the following participant rights: the right to appropriate and timely treatment for health conditions including the right to receive all care and services needed to improve or maintain the participant\u2019s health condition and to attain the highest practicable physical, emotional and social well-being; the right to have the PACE organization explain all treatment options; the right to be fully informed, in writing, before the PACE organization implements palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care services; the right to fully understand the PACE organization\u2019s palliative care, comfort care, and end-of-life care services; and the right to request services from the PACE organization, its employees, or contractors through the process described in \u00a7 460.121. \nSections 1894(b)(1)(B) and \n1934(b)(1)(B) of the Act establish that PACE organizations shall provide enrollees access to necessary covered items and services 24 hours per day, every day of the year. CMS codified these required services at \u00a7 460.92, which provides that the PACE benefit package for all participants, regardless of the source of payment, must include all Medicare covered services, all Medicaid covered services as specified in the State\u2019s approved Medicaid plan, and other services determined necessary by the IDT to improve and maintain the participant\u2019s overall health status. At \u00a7 460.98(a), CMS established the requirement for PACE organizations to provide care that meets the needs of each participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. However, through our audit and oversight activities, we have identified some PACE organizations that do not provide care meant to improve or maintain the participant\u2019s condition, and instead provide a palliative-like benefit, where the services provided to participants are geared more toward ensuring the participant\u2019s comfort even when that is not in line with the participant\u2019s wishes or needs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e51714d-9a42-44fe-8ee9-fb28d328e704": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e51714d-9a42-44fe-8ee9-fb28d328e704", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10787b7a-6d35-4d9e-90e1-c134309d56b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "61192a7a8c21ee7b37c186525feb0409d0aea2b1b1755ac53d9b15cf5803d9e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "256dca42-40ee-4ee5-ae9f-8c1acb96765e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f2b48dace707e91619ec75a65f7ff60dd526b46dd3e7bb7b9ca5ecbfb6d69dcd"}}, "hash": "3b8f1c6fe8a0dab9113e6644ad67542212b6c9f4579f6a10a385431a3b3853f2", "text": "We have also seen organizations, in care plans and notes from discussions with participants, use terms such as palliative care and comfort care without clearly defining those terms for the participants and/or their designated representatives, leaving participants and families confused as to what level of care they are receiving. Based on what we have seen through audits, we believe that not all participants understand that they are entitled to all care and services deemed necessary to improve or maintain their health status, and are not limited to services related to palliative, comfort or end-of-life care. As we stated in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 6041), enrollment in the PACE program continues until the participant\u2019s death, regardless of changes in health status, unless the participant voluntarily disenrolls or is involuntarily disenrolled. Therefore, it is reasonable that a PACE participant may transition from receiving treatment meant to cure or maintain health conditions at the time of enrollment, to receiving end-of- life care by the time they approach their death. However, it is essential that PACE participants understand their right to receive all treatments in the PACE benefit package that are necessary and appropriate at the time of enrollment and on an ongoing basis, and that they clearly understand their rights as they transition from receiving treatment focused on curing a condition or improving or maintaining their health status, to treatment meant solely to provide comfort. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we are \nproposing certain modifications to \u00a7 460.112. First, we propose to redesignate current paragraphs (a) through (c) as paragraphs (b) through (d) to allow for the addition of proposed new paragraph (a). Proposed new paragraph (a)(1) would state that participants have a right to appropriate and timely treatment for their health conditions, which includes the right to receive all care and services needed to improve or maintain the participant\u2019s health condition and attain the highest practicable physical, emotional, and social well-being. We are proposing to add this language in new paragraph (a)(1) of \u00a7 460.112 because the right to treatment is a separate and distinct right that should be assigned its own paragraph in the participant rights section. By creating a new paragraph (a) and titling it the right to treatment, we aim to emphasize the participant\u2019s right to receive care and services, which many of the other participant rights relate to or build upon. In drafting proposed new \u00a7 460.112(a)(1), we considered the language in \u00a7 460.92 related to services meant to improve or maintain the participant\u2019s health condition. Additionally, since a PACE organization is a direct care provider that serves nursing home eligible participants, we also considered nursing home regulations as we drafted this proposal. The nursing home regulations require that care plans must describe \u2018\u2018the services that are to be furnished to attain or maintain the resident\u2019s highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 483.21(b)(1)(i)). We adapted this language to align with existing PACE regulations. We believe this modification will ensure that PACE participants are made aware of their \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00211 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f781ea54-630a-4152-9b77-ce0913d44049": {"__data__": {"id_": "f781ea54-630a-4152-9b77-ce0913d44049", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7244373b-658e-4201-9835-786abc1fea6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "29f6dd43845db3f11ca95eade75d4b7feb59a928044919ae402038a38f6009eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e92b1a0-abdd-416c-9b23-0a0c4bf6af72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4ae1f972f6d5b1be08ff1f13b3d112ca70651324eed4204d1c0ab6c02a67f84d"}}, "hash": "993a80c3af92a9f9f20c2972b30bd8f27572f619163cfb8d942d4f04fdb2a7df", "text": "79662 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nright to receive any care and services \nthat are necessary to improve their condition to the highest practicable level, or maintain their condition to the highest practicable level, depending on the participant\u2019s health condition. \nIn addition, we propose to add to \n\u00a7 460.112 a new paragraph (a)(2), which would state that participants have the right to appropriate and timely treatment for their health conditions, including the right to access emergency health care services when and where the need arises without prior authorization by the PACE interdisciplinary team. The right to access emergency care services currently appears at \u00a7 460.112(d); however, we believe that it relates to the right to treatment, and therefore, we propose to move the text of current \u00a7 460.112(d) to new \u00a7 460.112(a)(2). It is appropriate that both of the proposed provisions concerning the right to treatment (that is, proposed paragraph (a)(1) regarding standard treatments and proposed paragraph (a)(2) regarding emergency treatments) appear in the same paragraph of \u00a7 460.112. \nIn the 1999 PACE interim final rule, \nCMS codified at \u00a7 460.112(a) (which we propose to redesignate as \u00a7 460.112(b)) that all participants have the right to considerate respectful care, and each participant has the right not to be discriminated against in the delivery of required PACE services based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, or source of payment (64 FR 66253). CMS also codified at \u00a7 460.112(e) the right of participants to participate fully in all treatment decisions. As part of that right, participants have the right to have all treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner and to make health care decisions, including the right to refuse treatment, and be informed of the consequences of the decisions (\u00a7 460.112(e)(1)). This right has two specific parts; the right to have all treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner, and the right to make health care decisions. We believe the first right, the right to have all treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner, relates more to the rights under redesignated \u00a7 460.112(b) (\u2018\u2018Respect and nondiscrimination\u2019\u2019). Therefore, we propose to add a new paragraph at \u00a7 460.112(b)(8) which states that participants have the right to have all information regarding PACE services and treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner. Culturally competent care respects diversity in the patient population and cultural factors \nthat can affect health and health care, and can contribute to the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. By moving the provision establishing the right to have treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner from \u00a7 460.112(e)(1) to new \u00a7 460.112(b)(8), as proposed, we would emphasize that receiving materials about all PACE services, not just treatment options, in a culturally competent manner is an inherent right. \nIn the 1999 PACE interim final rule \n(64 FR 66254), CMS codified the participant\u2019s rights to receive accurate and easily understood information at current \u00a7 460.112(b) (which we propose to redesignate as \u00a7 460.112(c)). In the 2006 PACE final rule, CMS further stated that this information was necessary for participants to \u2018\u2018comprehensively assess differences in their health care options\u2019\u2019 (71 FR 71295). CMS also codified at \u00a7 460.112(e) that \u2018\u2018a participant who is unable to participate fully in treatment decisions has the right to designate a representative\u2019\u2019 (64 FR 66290). For the participant\u2019s designated representative to be able to act on behalf of the participant in the event the participant is unable to make informed decisions, the designated representative should receive the same accurate, easily understood information the participant receives. Therefore, we are proposing to add language to the newly designated \u00a7 460.112(c) that would provide that a participant has the right to have all information in this section shared with their designated representative. As previously mentioned, participants may be enrolled with a PACE organization until their death, and therefore the PACE benefit adapts as the participant\u2019s needs change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e92b1a0-abdd-416c-9b23-0a0c4bf6af72": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e92b1a0-abdd-416c-9b23-0a0c4bf6af72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7244373b-658e-4201-9835-786abc1fea6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "29f6dd43845db3f11ca95eade75d4b7feb59a928044919ae402038a38f6009eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f781ea54-630a-4152-9b77-ce0913d44049", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "993a80c3af92a9f9f20c2972b30bd8f27572f619163cfb8d942d4f04fdb2a7df"}}, "hash": "4ae1f972f6d5b1be08ff1f13b3d112ca70651324eed4204d1c0ab6c02a67f84d", "text": "Because PACE is designed to meet a participant\u2019s needs, regardless of what those needs are, PACE organizations are permitted to provide participants similar benefits to hospice or end-of-life care while allowing participants to remain in PACE, assuming that is in line with the participant\u2019s wishes for treatment. However, we have seen as part of our audit and oversight activities that certain types of care offered by PACE organizations are not well-defined. For instance, through audits we have seen organizations use terms such as palliative care, comfort care, and end-of- life care, with little or no information on what those terms mean or how they are defined or implemented across PACE organizations. We have also seen that the lack of a clear, comprehensive definition of palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care has caused confusion to participants and/or their caregivers related to what care they are and are not getting when this type of \ncare is provided. While CMS does not seek to define these terms, we believe it is important for PACE organizations to define the terms within their respective programs, and provide clear information to participants and their designated representatives on what the terms mean. Participants and their representatives have the right to understand how their choices to pursue these different types of treatment options will impact their ability to continue pursuing care and services meant to improve or maintain their health conditions. Therefore, we are proposing to add language to newly designated \u00a7 460.112(c)(5) that would provide that participants have the right to be fully informed, in writing, of several factors before the PACE organization implements palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care. We propose that the written notification to participants must explain four different aspects of the treatment options, which we outline in proposed \u00a7 460.112(c)(5)(i) through (iv). \nFirst, we propose at \u00a7 460.112(c)(5)(i) \nthat the written notification must include a description of the palliative care, comfort care, and end-of-life care services (as applicable) and how they differ from the care the participant is currently receiving to meet their individual needs. The explanation of the different types of care, and more importantly, how they differ from the care being currently received is important in ensuring that participants are fully informed of their options for treatment and are therefore able to make informed decisions on the care they wish to receive. A participant should have the right to fully understand the care they are agreeing to receive prior to that care being initiated. \nProposed \u00a7 460.112(c)(5)(ii) would \nrequire PACE organizations to explain, in writing, to participants or their designated representative whether palliative care, comfort care, or end-of- life care services (as applicable) will be provided in addition to or in lieu of the care the participant is currently receiving. We have seen through audit that some PACE participants receive palliative care and/or comfort care in addition to other services a participant may be receiving, including services meant to improve or maintain their health condition. We have also seen PACE participants receive palliative care and/or comfort care instead of providing services meant to improve or maintain the participant\u2019s health condition. In other words, for some participants, when they agree to receive \npalliative care or comfort care, they are also agreeing to no longer receive care \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00212 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22cd8c4b-8099-40a7-8e6c-eb0522a5789b": {"__data__": {"id_": "22cd8c4b-8099-40a7-8e6c-eb0522a5789b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5000c1a-6858-4591-9b35-d5dbf3d7a23b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "09444a41b381838ee53f5a0309976c7de729e8ae39d8b684ba0e5a7c2b57706b"}, "3": {"node_id": "acada451-7724-4fbf-bcf7-86bf433ea04a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6399074dbab2c3ba06e7b8e50410fdc0a0cedbf1ef3a681b5f272a2d899ebee7"}}, "hash": "bbdce2380402cd86a47b04db6f225b2ed11f9351039525ce5ae9ae3df0625861", "text": "79663 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nmeant to improve or maintain their \nhealth condition and are receiving, in essence, end-of-life care. While this may be appropriate in some instances, given a participant\u2019s condition, it is important that participants fully understand what they are agreeing to when they enter into palliative or comfort care status. We believe that part of the appeal of PACE to participants is the person-centered nature of the benefit, which allows for the IDT to provide any and all services that are tailored around the participant\u2019s needs. This is true for end of life services too. One participant may want, and the IDT may approve, comfort measures in addition to treatment meant to maintain the participant\u2019s health condition. Another participant may be at the end of their life, and may only want treatment meant to reduce or control pain. CMS believes that the PACE organization is allowed to pursue either scenario, but that the participant must be able to understand the options and what care they will or will not receive in order to make an informed decision. \nProposed \u00a7 460.112(c)(5)(iii) would \nrequire PACE organizations to identify all services that would be impacted if the participant and/or their designated representative elects to initiate palliative care, comfort care, or end-of- life care. For example, one or more of the following types of services could be impacted and the PACE organization should include the impacted services in the detailed description: physician services (including specialist services), hospital services, long-term care services, nursing services, social services, dietary services, transportation, home care, therapy (including physical, occupational, and speech), behavioral health, diagnostic testing (including imaging and laboratory services), medications, preventative healthcare services, and PACE center attendance. Under this proposal, PACE organizations would be required to provide a detailed explanation of how specific services would be impacted by the addition of or transition to palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care. If the participant would be receiving palliative care or comfort care in addition to all the other services they are currently receiving, then the PACE organization may not have to provide a detailed analysis, and could simply include language that the designation of palliative care or comfort care will not impact any existing services. However, if moving a participant to palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care would impact their services (for example a participant would no longer \nbe sent to specialists, or they would no longer be sent to the hospital), then a PACE organization would be required to identify the services that would be impacted, and explain how those services would be impacted. \nProposed \u00a7 460.112(c)(5)(iv) would \nstate that the participant has the right to revoke or withdraw their consent to receive palliative, comfort, or end-of-life care at any time and for any reason either verbally or in writing. We also propose to require PACE organizations to explain this right to participants both orally and in writing. A participant has the right to fully participate in treatment decisions, as established at current \u00a7 460.112(e). Part of that right is participating in the decision-making process of what care to receive, and a participant must not only understand what the proposed care or treatment decisions mean, but also that they can change their mind with regards to treatment decisions previously made. We have seen through audits and oversight activities that participants or their designated representatives may decide to pursue palliative care or comfort care, without fully understanding what those terms mean. We have also seen situations where participants or their designated representatives want to stop palliative care or comfort care when they realize they will no longer receive other services and do not know they have the right to revisit prior treatment decisions. Participants should be clearly informed, in writing, that they have the ability to change their mind on these important treatment decisions. \nIn the 1999 PACE interim final rule \n(64 FR 66255), CMS established at \u00a7 460.112(e) the right for each participant to fully participate in all decisions related to his or her care.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acada451-7724-4fbf-bcf7-86bf433ea04a": {"__data__": {"id_": "acada451-7724-4fbf-bcf7-86bf433ea04a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5000c1a-6858-4591-9b35-d5dbf3d7a23b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "09444a41b381838ee53f5a0309976c7de729e8ae39d8b684ba0e5a7c2b57706b"}, "2": {"node_id": "22cd8c4b-8099-40a7-8e6c-eb0522a5789b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bbdce2380402cd86a47b04db6f225b2ed11f9351039525ce5ae9ae3df0625861"}}, "hash": "6399074dbab2c3ba06e7b8e50410fdc0a0cedbf1ef3a681b5f272a2d899ebee7", "text": "Paragraph (e)(1) specifies that this includes the right \u2018\u2018[t]o have all treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner and to make health care decisions, including the right to refuse treatment, and be informed of the consequences of the decisions.\u2019\u2019 In this proposed rule, we are proposing to modify the language in \u00a7 460.112(e)(1) by removing the language regarding the participant\u2019s right to have all treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner. As we explained in the discussion around our proposed amendments to \u00a7 460.112(b), the right to have treatment options explained in a culturally competent manner is better suited for inclusion in that paragraph, \nwhich, as amended, sets forth participant rights related to respect and non-discrimination. We also propose to restructure and modify \u00a7 460.112(e)(1) by separating the requirements into three subparts at \u00a7 460.112(e)(1)(i), (ii) and (iii). We propose at \u00a7 460.112(e)(1)(i) to establish that participants\u2019 right to make health care decisions includes the right to have all treatment options fully explained to them.

A participant cannot make an informed health care decision without fully understanding the options available. Proposed \u00a7 460.112(e)(1)(ii) would provide that participants have the right to refuse any and all care and services. As we explained in the 2006 PACE final rule (71 FR 71298), the right to refuse treatment is a type of health care decision, and participants have the right to make those decisions. We propose at \u00a7 460.112(e)(1)(iii) to specify that participants have the right to be informed of the consequences their decisions may have on their health and/ or psychosocial status. The language at current \u00a7 460.112(e)(1) refers to the participant\u2019s right to \u2018\u2018be informed of the consequences of the decisions,\u2019\u2019 but we propose to add additional specificity around that right and the obligation it creates for PACE organizations by modifying the regulatory language to refer to the participant\u2019s right to \u2018\u2018be informed of the consequences their decisions may have on their health and/ or psychosocial status.\u2019\u2019 We believe this proposed revision would emphasize that the participant should be made aware of how their decision to refuse care may impact their health and/or psychosocial status. For example, if a physician was recommending the participant have a diagnostic cardiac catherization, and the participant refused, the participant has the right to be informed that, by not having the diagnostic testing done, they might be at increased risk for a cardiac event, including a heart attack. \nWe propose to further amend \n\u00a7 460.112(e) by redesignating current paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) as (e)(3) through (e)(7), and by adding a new paragraph (e)(2), which would state that participants have a right to fully understand the PACE organization\u2019s palliative care, comfort care, and end-of- life care services. Proposed paragraph (e)(2) would further require that PACE organizations take several steps, outlined at proposed \u00a7 460.112(e)(2)(i) through (iii), in order to ensure that participants understand this right.

While palliative care, comfort care, and ultimately, end-of-life care are necessary components of the PACE benefit, PACE organizations must ensure that participants fully understand these terms and treatment options, prior to them being initiated. \nAt \u00a7 460.112(e)(2)(i), we propose to \nestablish that the PACE organization must fully explain the applicable treatment options to the participant prior to initiating palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care services. This proposal would require the PACE organization to explain to the participant what these terms mean, and how choosing one of those options would impact the participant\u2019s health. We are also proposing at \u00a7 460.112(e)(2)(ii) to require that the PACE organization provide the participant with written information about their treatment options in accordance with \u00a7 460.112(c)(5). In the discussion around \u00a7 460.112(c)(5), we highlighted that we believe providing written information on these terms is important for the participant, and that the information must include details regarding the treatment and how the participant\u2019s current services may be impacted. We are proposing to add paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) as separate provisions because the organization should be responsible both for providing the written notification outlined in \u00a7 460.112(c)(5), and actually explaining the treatment options in a way that is understandable to the participant. A participant may be overwhelmed by receiving only written notification; therefore, both provisions are necessary to ensure the participant has a full understanding of their options. Finally, we are proposing at \u00a7 460.112(e)(2)(iii) that the PACE organization obtain written consent from the participant or their designated representative to change a treatment plan to include palliative care, comfort care, or end of life care. Because some organizations stop treatments to improve or maintain a participant\u2019s condition when a participant enters palliative care or comfort care, it is especially important that participants or their designated representatives are in agreement with these treatment options, and consent to receiving this care. We believe ensuring that this consent is in writing is the most appropriate safeguard, not only for participants, but also for PACE organizations to ensure that they have adequate documentation to support providing these benefits. We propose to redesignate current paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) of \u00a7 460.112 as (e)(3) through (e)(7) to allow for the addition of a new paragraph (e)(2) as discussed in this section. We want to emphasize that this proposed requirement would not take the place of any advanced directives a participant may have, and would not eliminate the requirement in current \u00a7 460.112(e)(2) (which would be redesignated as (e)(3) under our proposal) that requires a PACE organization to explain advance directives and to establish them, if the participant so desires. That directive is distinct from the notification proposed at new \u00a7 460.112(e)(2), which should explain the services under the PACE benefit that may be provided or not provided to the participant as a part of their care decisions. \nIn the 1999 PACE interim final rule \n(64 FR 66256, 66290), CMS codified at \u00a7 460.112(g) the participant\u2019s right to \u2018\u2018a fair and efficient process for resolving differences with the PACE organization, including a rigorous system for internal review by the organization and an independent system of external review.\u2019\u2019 In the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 5864), CMS added \u00a7 460.121 to clearly define service determination requests and specify the requirements for how those requests would be processed. As we explained in that rule, the service determination request process serves an important participant protection, as it allows a participant to advocate for services (86 FR 6008). We also explained that the service determination request process is the first step of the appeals process (86 FR 6008). At \u00a7 460.112(g)(1), the participant is provided the right to be encouraged and assisted to voice complaints to PACE staff and outside representatives; and \u00a7 460.112(g)(2) provides participants the right to appeal any treatment decision of the PACE organization, its employees, or contractors through the process described in \u00a7 460.122.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2dba9ee-01bf-4023-bdea-258c59cf96c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2dba9ee-01bf-4023-bdea-258c59cf96c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d84b306e-1efa-44f7-95a8-5dfb1257d3b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "71a3943633dd5ddff6a7445ee7dc6d1d0cbab2361794e5f14f02c9b2676492a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae6c85c8-b2eb-4d73-9816-bea8a69e1507", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "59dc9ce162a6f6e936e9ba597c63b0478d107e8dc1d7ed1c5c2229d7d563d71d"}}, "hash": "7405ca1684d971ab72e1d8d3c30d9cd3b8a48e91f1709953903624edf0234eb7", "text": "Because the participant rights in section \u00a7 460.112(g) discusses both the right to voice grievances and the right to appeal, it should also reference the right to request a service determination request, which is the first step in the appeals process.

We propose to redesignate current paragraph (g)(2) as (g)(3) to allow for the \naddition of a new paragraph (g)(2) as discussed in this section. We believe the burden associated with this provision is related to developing written templates regarding the PACE organization\u2019s palliative, comfort, and end-of-life care services and tailoring those templates to the participants. We discuss the burden in the collection of information section. \nK. Grievance Process (\u00a7 460.120) \nSections 1894(b)(2)(B) and \n1934(b)(2)(B) of the Act specify that \nPACE organizations must have in effect written safeguards of the rights of enrolled participants, including procedures for grievances and appeals. We have codified requirements around the processing of grievances at \u00a7 460.120. The grievance process serves as an important participant protection as it allows for participants and their family members to express complaints related to the quality of care a participant receives, or the delivery of services. Currently, \u00a7 460.120 defines a grievance as a complaint, either oral or written, expressing dissatisfaction with service delivery or the quality of care furnished. A PACE organization must have a formal written process to evaluate and resolve medical and nonmedical grievances by participants, family members, or representatives (\u00a7 460.120(a)). At a minimum, the PACE organization\u2019s grievance process must include written procedures for the following: (1) how a participant files a grievance; (2) documentation of a participant\u2019s grievance; (3) response to, and resolution of, grievances in a timely manner; and (4) maintenance of confidentiality of a participant\u2019s grievance (\u00a7 460.120(c)). \nA PACE organization must discuss \nwith and provide to the participant in writing the specific steps, including timeframes for response, that will be \ntaken to resolve the participant\u2019s grievance. The PACE organization must also maintain, aggregate, and analyze grievance data for use in its internal quality improvement operations (\u00a7 460.120(f)). \nSince the grievance regulations were \ncodified in 1999, CMS has received feedback from PACE organizations requesting clarification and guidance on the grievance process. Additionally, we have discovered through audits that the current grievance process, which allows PACE organizations latitude to define their own grievance resolution timeframes and develop their own procedures for processing grievances, has created confusion and inconsistency in how grievances are handled from organization to organization.

We also propose certain adjustments that would align the requirements with the service determination process in \u00a7 460.121 for consistency. \nCurrently, the grievance requirements \nat \u00a7 460.120(a) require a PACE organization to have a formal written process to evaluate and resolve medical and nonmedical grievances by participants, their family members, or representatives. We propose to modify paragraph (a) of \u00a7 460.120 to align more closely with paragraph (a) of \u00a7 460.121, which establishes the requirement to have certain written procedures in place for identifying and processing service determination requests. First, we propose to amend \u00a7 460.120(a) by removing the current paragraph header, which reads \u2018\u2018Process to resolve grievances,\u2019\u2019, adding in its place a new paragraph header, which would read, \u2018\u2018Written procedures.\u2019\u2019 Specifically, we propose to modify the requirement to state that each PACE organization must have formal written procedures to promptly identify, document, investigate and resolve all medical and nonmedical grievances in accordance with the requirements in this part. It is important to ensure that PACE organizations develop internal processes and procedures to properly implement the grievance process. In addition, we propose to further amend \u00a7 460.120(a) by removing the list of individuals who can file a grievance, as we are proposing to create a new paragraph that outlines who may file a grievance at \u00a7 460.120(d). \nWe propose to add to \u00a7 460.120 a new \nparagraph (b), which would define a grievance in PACE as a complaint, either oral or written, expressing dissatisfaction with service delivery or the quality of care furnished, regardless of whether remedial action is requested; and further that a grievance may be between a participant and the PACE organization or any other entity or individual through which the PACE organization provides services to the participant. Currently, the term grievance is defined in the introductory paragraph of \u00a7 460.120 as a complaint, either written or oral, expressing dissatisfaction with service delivery or the quality of care furnished. We have heard from PACE organizations over the years that they would prefer that the term grievance be better defined in the \nregulations, and we have received requests from PACE organizations for the grievance definition to be narrowed \nto exclude complaints that may not rise to the level of a grievance. Based on this feedback, we considered how we might refine the definition of grievance for purposes of PACE. In doing so, we reviewed how grievances are defined in other managed care programs and care settings, specifically in MA and in nursing homes. \nThe MA regulations define a \ngrievance as any complaint or dispute, other than one that constitutes as organization determination, expressing dissatisfaction with any aspect of an MA organization\u2019s or provider\u2019s operations, activities, or behavior, regardless of whether remedial action is requested (\u00a7 422.561). While the long-term care regulations do not define \u2018\u2018grievance\u2019\u2019, \u00a7 483.10(j)(1) provides that a resident has the right to voice grievances to the facility or other agency or entity that hears grievances without discrimination or reprisal and without fear of discrimination or reprisal. Section 483.10(j)(1) further specifies that such grievances include those with respect to care and treatment which has been furnished as well as that which has not been furnished, the behavior of staff and of other residents; and other concerns regarding their long-term care facility stay. When considering these other approaches to defining what constitutes a grievance, we concluded that the definition used in PACE is already tailored more narrowly than the MA or nursing home requirements. That being the case, we do not believe it would be appropriate to narrow the definition even more, and potentially limit a PACE participant\u2019s ability to complain about their care and have their complaints resolved through a formal process. \nHowever, we recognize that there are \naspects of the MA regulations\u2019 definition of grievance that would be helpful to include in the PACE definition at \u00a7 460.120, because it would further refine the grievance definition and offer clarity sought by PACE organizations in previous feedback. For example, in developing our proposal, we noted that the MA regulations specify that a grievance is any complaint that meets the definition at \u00a7 422.561 regardless of whether remedial action is requested.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3daa7c5c-3528-4236-afb8-4be69bda44c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3daa7c5c-3528-4236-afb8-4be69bda44c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7eae66ae-b0c3-4d03-a630-575a0a3f4fcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "46646af67e61c9b49e65116be814e83628e0fac1512d645d0b5ea8acb59a2d20"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d34505c-ce83-4446-9acf-6028db18af0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c681a699f382a291905391a4d7809bd41b40386ba39f00f1995885907e8107fd"}}, "hash": "b81f110847188b871c387e53169cfa9f4462c5fc0cac704769c13f79fa7104fe", "text": "We have seen on audit where PACE organizations will not recognize or process complaints that fit within the definition of a grievance, because remedial action was not requested. However, we want to stress that a grievance must be identified and processed if it satisfies the definition, regardless of whether \nremedial action is requested. This is an important participant safeguard because grievances are required under the \ncurrent \u00a7 460.120(f) to be maintained, aggregated and analyzed as part of the PACE organization\u2019s quality improvement program. Regardless of whether remedial action is requested, it is important for organizations to analyze all complaints received in order to ensure they are making necessary improvements in their quality program. For these reasons, we propose to include in our definition of a grievance that a request for remedial action is not required. \nIn further consideration of MA \ngrievance regulations, and specifically MA grievance procedures at \u00a7 422.564, we propose that the definition of a grievance would provide that a grievance may be between a participant and the PACE organization, but it may also be between any other entity or individual through which the PACE organization provides services to the participant. This proposed change to the PACE grievance definition is based on the MA grievance definition, which provides at the current \u00a7 422.564(a) that each MA organization must provide meaningful procedures for timely hearing and resolving grievances between enrollees and the organization or any other entity or individual through which the organization provides health care services under any MA plan it offers. PACE provides a wide array of services through different home care agencies, medical specialists, and facilities such as nursing homes. It is important that a participant or their family have the ability to voice complaints related to any care they receive, even if that care is provided through a contracted entity or individual. \nWe are proposing the grievance \ndefinition at \u00a7 460.120(b) be: \u2018\u2018For purposes of this part, a grievance is a complaint, either oral or written, expressing dissatisfaction with service delivery or the quality of care furnished, regardless of whether remedial action is requested.

We are proposing to redesignate \u00a7 460.120(b) as \u00a7 460.120(c), change the title, and amend the regulation text. Specifically, we propose to change the title from notification to participants to grievance process notification to participants, to differentiate from notifications related to grievance resolutions, and that the grievance process notification be written in understandable language. We propose to add new paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) to \u00a7 460.120, which would set forth requirements for the grievance process notification. We solicit comment on whether the other individuals should receive the grievance process notification, in addition to the participant, upon the participant\u2019s enrollment and annually thereafter. Specifically, we are soliciting comment on whether the other individuals specified in \u00a7 460.120(d) should receive the grievance process notification, or at a minimum, whether the participant\u2019s designated representative should receive the notification in addition to the participant. \nFirst, we propose at \u00a7 460.120(c)(1) \nthat the grievance process notification must include information on the right of the participant or other individual specified in \u00a7 460.120(d) to voice grievances without discrimination or reprisal, and without fear of discrimination or reprisal. In developing this proposal, we again considered the long-term care regulation at \u00a7 483.10(j)(1), and we believe that the language in the long-term care regulation that provides that a resident has the right to voice grievances without reprisal or discrimination and without the fear of reprisal or discrimination would also be relevant in PACE. PACE participants have the right to voice complaints to PACE staff without reprisal by the PACE staff under current \u00a7 460.112(g)(1), but we believe this right should be specifically called out in the PACE regulations, as written in the long-term care regulations, in the notification that goes to participants about the grievance process. By including it in the notification under proposed \u00a7 460.120(c), we would ensure that participants would be aware of this right to complain, and that they are assured in that notification that they and the other individuals specified in \n\u00a7 460.120(d) should not fear making complaints. When we have conducted interviews of PACE participants and \ntheir family members as part of our audit process, we have heard that some participants are afraid to voice grievances for fear that the PACE organization will take some punitive action against them. For example, some participants have expressed fears that the PACE organization will eliminate their center attendance, or discontinue other necessary services, if the participant complains about the care they receive. We believe it is important for the grievance process notification to participants to emphasize that a participant or other individual specified in \u00a7 460.120(d) has the right to voice grievances without the fear of reprisal or discrimination. \nWe propose at \u00a7 460.120(c)(2) that the \ngrievance process notification must inform pariticipants that a Medicare participant as defined in \u00a7 460.6 or other individual specified in \u00a7 460.120(d) acting on behalf of a Medicare participant has the right to file a written complaint with the quality improvement organization (QIO) with regard to Medicare covered services, consistent with section 1154(a)(14) of the Act. Section 1154(a)(14) provides that the QIO \u2018\u2018shall conduct an appropriate review of all written complaints about the quality of services (for which payment may otherwise be made under title XVIII) not meeting professionally recognized standards of health care, if the complaint is filed with the organization by an individual entitled to benefits for such services under such title (or a person acting on the individual\u2019s behalf).\u2019\u2019 Title XVIII of the Act is the Medicare statute, so this provision is specific to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare-covered benefits. Since most PACE participants are Medicare beneficiaries, they are also eligible to submit quality of care grievances to a QIO. This right has not been formally provided to PACE participants before, and we are proposing to require it now in order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in PACE understand this additional right.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a40173a-a657-40d0-9abb-8f6383cfeb85": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a40173a-a657-40d0-9abb-8f6383cfeb85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0443bfef-0058-4c12-802f-e1502c1850de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "520fa87e8a3894ba4c5c3b1721d1e32276ed30731717bfde8e7d58603942ae52"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c17696f-de84-45b9-9ee6-c8cad9f8b09e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1ec9a0a99b89750f18ffa91b0bd7c9ee713235503cc5d64e989f0ae4fe094f1a"}}, "hash": "b6234a94f89b679ffa6c74717497188f60727e20ba6d370d79ebe105d4fb19a0", "text": "We propose at \u00a7 460.120(c)(3) to \nrequire that the grievance process notification include the grievance definition at \u00a7 460.120(b) and provide information on all grievance processing requirements in paragraphs (d) through (k) of \u00a7 460.120. In order for the grievance process to serve as a fair and efficient avenue for participants to express their dissatisfaction with service delivery or the quality of care furnished, and to resolve their differences with the \nPACE organization or any other entity or individual through which the PACE organization provides services to the \nparticipant, participants must understand how to submit a grievance to the organization, and how that grievance will be processed once submitted. \nCurrently, at \u00a7 460.120(c), PACE \norganizations are required to develop written procedures that, at a minimum, must address how a participant files a grievance, documentation of the participant\u2019s grievance, response to and resolution of a grievance in a timely manner, and maintenance of confidentiality of a participant\u2019s grievance. These requirements allow PACE organizations to develop their own procedures for resolving grievances, including creating their own timeframes for doing so. Given the frail and vulnerable population in PACE, we believe that additional structure around how grievances should be processed is necessary. Therefore, we are proposing to remove the language that is currently at \u00a7 460.120(c) and create specific processing requirements in its place. \nWe propose to move the language \nregarding who can submit a grievance from current \u00a7 460.120(a) to a new paragraph at \u00a7 460.120(d), as we believe the details regarding who is eligible to file a grievance will be more easily understood if they are placed in a new paragraph and separated from the remainder of \u00a7 460.120(a), which, under our proposed amendments, would require PACE organizations to have a formal written process to promptly identify, document, investigate, and resolve all grievances. Current \u00a7 460.120(a) provides that grievances can be submitted by participants, family members or their representatives. We propose to amend the list of individuals who can submit a grievance to include the participant\u2019s caregiver. We believe the proposed addition would be in alignment with the service determination process requirements in \u00a7 460.121, which allow a participant\u2019s caregiver to request services (\u00a7 460.121(c)(3)), and with the plan of care requirements at \u00a7 460.106, which allow the caregiver to be involved in the development and reevaluation of the care plan (\u00a7 460.106(e)). \nAs we stated in the January 2021 final \nrule (86 FR 6018), given the fact that caregivers may provide some care to the \nparticipants, it is important that caregivers are able to advocate for services on the participant\u2019s behalf. Similarly, if caregivers are providing some care to the participant, they should be able to make complaints related to any aspect of the care that the participant receives from the PACE organization.

As we explained in the January 2021 final (86 FR 6018), we have not historically considered \u2018\u2018caregivers\u2019\u2019 to include employees or contractors of the organization. We know some organizations may use the term \u2018\u2018caregiver\u2019\u2019 to describe an aide at a nursing home, but CMS would not generally consider these individuals to fall within this category. We also explained in that rule (86 FR 6018) that employees and contractors of the PACE organizations enter into a contractual relationship with the PACE organization and generally have a predominately financial incentive to provide care; and we have not considered these individuals to be \u2018\u2018caregivers\u2019\u2019 under the regulations. While these paid individuals may have pertinent information related to the participant\u2019s care, their feedback is captured under the requirements for the IDT to remain alert to pertinent information under current \u00a7 460.102(d)(2)(ii). We do not believe that these paid individuals would generally be entitled to file a grievance under \u00a7 460.120. We solicit comment on our proposal to amend the list of individuals who can submit a grievance to include a participant\u2019s caregiver. \nIn order to provide more clarity \nregarding CMS\u2019 expectations for recognizing and processing complaints as grievances, we believe it is appropriate that we add additional structure to the regulations concerning how a grievance may be submitted, similar to how the service determination regulations are structured. We propose to add these rules around the submission of grievances in new paragraph \u00a7 460.120(e). \nProposed \u00a7 460.120(e)(1) would \nprovide that any individual permitted to file a grievance with a PACE organization under \u00a7 460.120(d) may do so either orally or in writing. Currently, the introductory text of \u00a7 460.120 allows for a grievance to be filed orally or in writing. The right to file a grievance orally or in writing is an important participant safeguard, especially in an aging population, and it should continue to appear in our regulations. However, we believe it is more appropriate that we codify this right in a separate provision (as opposed to \nfolding it into the definition of the term grievance, as in current \u00a7 460.120) in new proposed paragraph (e), along with \nthe other proposed requirements for the submission of grievances. Proposed \u00a7 460.120(e)(2) would establish that the PACE organization may not require a written grievance to be submitted on a specific form. While we understand that some organizations may use forms to help them process and investigate the grievance, we do not believe that a PACE participant should be restricted in how they can submit the complaint. We have seen participants detail their complaints to PACE organizations in letters and email correspondence. Receipt of these written complaints should be considered grievances and accepted in their original form. If a PACE organization decides to create a grievance form on its own and summarize the original grievance, that would continue to be permitted under our proposal, as long as the PACE organization maintains the written communication in its original form as required by \u00a7 460.200(d)(2). \nProposed \u00a7 460.120(e)(3) would \nprovide that a grievance may be made to any employee or contractor of the PACE organization that provides care to a participant in the participant\u2019s residence, the PACE center, or while transporting participants. This language is similar to the method for filing a service determination request at \u00a7 460.121(d)(2). As we indicated in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 6019), these are the settings where participants have the most frequent contact with employees or contractors of the PACE organization, and therefore are logical settings for service determination requests to occur. We believe the same logic can be applied to grievances, and as a result, we limited our proposal to employees and contractors working in these settings. \nWe propose at new \u00a7 460.120(f) to \nestablish the requirement that the PACE organization must conduct a thorough investigation of all distinct issues within the grievance when the cause of the issue is not already known. Investigating why the situation occurred is an important part of ensuring that appropriate action will be taken in response to a grievance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78ee095a-c84d-400c-9494-fe154f07df28": {"__data__": {"id_": "78ee095a-c84d-400c-9494-fe154f07df28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa6f8dc2-df80-4bbb-a1c3-099bb1920df0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2fcc0db99ab42947e56ce7d98b96ca0a630a435e30437d55826be46f798fd769"}, "2": {"node_id": "d62c3962-7c03-4636-a006-3f6ae64cccf2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "829340d623ae8c2e9f92023a5cec93c18ebb31f63985ad5f15c86a8779c799c1"}}, "hash": "9d3173871deb5169d8c1a71504ad9a805083b4fa00ed91430d431498420b0839", "text": "However, we also recognize there may be some situations where the cause for the complaint or a specific issue is already known and therefore an investigation is not needed. For example, if the PACE bus has a flat tire, and as a result is late to pick up a participant for their center attendance, the participant may complain to the PACE organization about the late pick-up. While this would \nconstitute a grievance and would need to be identified and processed, an investigation would not be necessary because the PACE organization was already aware of the cause of the complaint (that is, the flat tire). If there are multiple issues within a grievance that require investigation, proposed \u00a7 460.120(f) would require the PACE organization to conduct a thorough investigation into each distinct issue when the cause of an issue is not known. We have seen on audit that some complaints may contain different issues within the one grievance. For example, a participant may call to complain that their home care aide is routinely late and does not clean the kitchen as is care planned for that participant. These are 2 different issues and both may need to be investigated in order to appropriately resolve the grievance. The PACE organization as a result of its investigation may determine that while the aide was late due to poor time management skills, the kitchen was not being cleaned because the home care company did not have the most recent care plan for the participant. The results of the investigation would directly impact how the PACE organization would resolve these concerns. \nWe propose at new \u00a7 460.120(g) to \nestablish resolution and notification timeframes that would apply to grievances. Specifically, we propose at \u00a7 460.120(g)(1) that the PACE organization must take action to resolve the grievance based on the results of its investigation as expeditiously as the case requires, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the PACE organization receives the oral or written grievance. Again, we considered both the MA grievance regulations and also the long-term care regulations. While the long-term care regulations do not define a timeframe for resolving grievances, the MA regulation at \u00a7 422.564(e)(1) requires that an MA organization must notify an enrollee who submits a grievance of the organization\u2019s decision as expeditiously as the case requires, based on the enrollee\u2019s health status, but no later than 30 days after the date the organization receives the oral or written grievance. We believe this is a fair timeframe, and based on our oversight efforts, we believe that a majority of organizations currently utilize a similar timeframe for resolving grievances. In our proposal for the PACE grievance regulation, we propose to adopt a modified version of the requirement in the MA regulations, which would specify that the 30-day timeframe is the maximum amount of time the PACE organization has to resolve the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00217 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79f9e921-f3ec-4863-80fd-a1f426a8f4c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "79f9e921-f3ec-4863-80fd-a1f426a8f4c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b64bcb0-0c2e-4a25-b4c9-6d630d15db7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "71bab572b5cc2dbd83f548a739e583c0b1a872068e2149816a10148a2753994e"}, "3": {"node_id": "53630271-da7b-4b39-9fc6-1158ddacad90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6e7dc075f2acdf1e1d3e310688b5de5dcd12f3625b8bbfd3b3a3742c67c4ff19"}}, "hash": "b1ad3e712230ad0b487985c5a71e13f08e7c41b7b4e5e0828ba4d04048b7bb43", "text": "79668 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \ngrievance, as opposed to the maximum \namount of time to notify the participant. Proposed \u00a7 460.120(g) would maintain the language regarding ensuring that this timeframe is a maximum length of time, and that organizations may need to resolve grievances more quickly if the participant\u2019s case requires. We propose at \u00a7 460.120(g)(2) that the PACE organization must notify the individual who submitted the grievance of the grievance resolution as expeditiously as the case requires, but no later than 3 calendar days after the date the PACE organization resolves the grievance in accordance with \u00a7 460.120(g)(1). We contemplated combining both the notification and resolution of a grievance into a single timeframe, but ultimately decided against that. We believe that the act of resolving a grievance, and the act of notifying the submitter about the resolution, are two separate actions. Additionally, as we will discuss in this section of this proposed rule in relation to proposed new \u00a7 460.120(i), we believe this exception strengthens our rationale for having distinct resolution and notification timeframes since we would expect a timely resolution of the grievance even if the individual who submitted the grievance requested not to be notified of that resolution. \nProposed \u00a7 460.120(h) would \nestablish requirements for the processing of expedited grievances. Specifically, we propose to require that the PACE organization must resolve and notify the individual who submitted the grievance of the grievance resolution as expeditiously as the case requires, but no later than 24 hours after the time the PACE organization receives the oral or written grievance if the nature of the grievance could have an imminent and significant impact on the health or safety of the participant. Because PACE organizations are direct care providers, it is important that they have a system for recognizing and processing complaints quickly when those complaints could have both an imminent and significant impact on the health or safety of the participant. We have not chosen to define the words \u2018\u2018imminent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018significant\u2019\u2019, because we believe PACE determine how they will define those terms as a part of their development of their grievance procedures. PACE organizations should already have some system in place to recognize similar situations as organization\u2019s are currently required as a part of their quality improvement program at \u00a7 460.136(a)(5) to immediately correct any identified problem that directly or potentially threatens the health and safety of a \nPACE participant. It would be important for PACE organizations to have a procedures for quickly responding to those complaints that may have an imminent and significant impact on the participant\u2019s health or safety. For example, if a participant complains that a home care aide abused him or her, and the aide is due back in the home later that day, the PACE organization should be prepared to investigate and resolve that concern immediately. \nWe propose at new \u00a7 460.120(i) to \ncreate grievance resolution notification requirements for how the PACE organization must inform the individual who submitted the grievance of the resolution of that grievance. We propose at \u00a7 460.120(i)(1) that the PACE organization may inform the individual either orally or in writing, based on the individual\u2019s preference for notification, except for grievances identified in \u00a7 460.120(i)(3). We contemplated following the MA rule around notification in \u00a7 422.564(e)(3), which allows for oral grievances to be responded to orally or in writing, but requires written grievances to be responded to in writing. However, we understand that because PACE organizations are not only an insurer, but also a provider, they often have calls or other remote communications with participants, and likely talk with them more often than an MA organization would talk with one of their enrollees. We also understand that some PACE participants would prefer oral notification, even if they their grievance was submitted in writing. Likewise, some PACE participants may call with a grievance, but may want a formal written notice explaining the resolution. Therefore, we believe that PACE organizations should tailor the notification of the grievance resolution to what a PACE participant prefers. \nWe propose to establish at \n\u00a7 460.120(i)(2) that oral or written notification of grievance resolutions must include a minimum of three requirements. First, we propose at \u00a7 460.120(i)(2)(i) that the notification must include a summary statement of the participant\u2019s grievance including all distinct issues. This is especially important when a grievance cannot be resolved immediately and requires additional investigation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53630271-da7b-4b39-9fc6-1158ddacad90": {"__data__": {"id_": "53630271-da7b-4b39-9fc6-1158ddacad90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b64bcb0-0c2e-4a25-b4c9-6d630d15db7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "71bab572b5cc2dbd83f548a739e583c0b1a872068e2149816a10148a2753994e"}, "2": {"node_id": "79f9e921-f3ec-4863-80fd-a1f426a8f4c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "b1ad3e712230ad0b487985c5a71e13f08e7c41b7b4e5e0828ba4d04048b7bb43"}}, "hash": "6e7dc075f2acdf1e1d3e310688b5de5dcd12f3625b8bbfd3b3a3742c67c4ff19", "text": "This is especially important when a grievance cannot be resolved immediately and requires additional investigation. When notifying a participant or other individual who submitted the complaint, it would be important to restate the distinct issues of the grievance so they understand what the organization was investigating and resolving. Second, we propose at \n\u00a7 460.120(i)(2)(ii) that for each distinct issue that requires an investigation, the notification must include the steps taken to investigate the issue and a summary of the pertinent findings or conclusions regarding the concerns for each issue. As we stated earlier, we do not believe that every grievance, or every issue within a grievance, will require an investigation, and some issues may require minimal investigation; however, we believe that to the extent it is applicable it would be important for the individual who submitted the grievance to understand what the organization did during their investigation. Third, we propose at \u00a7 460.120(i)(2)(iii) that for a grievance that requires corrective action, the grievance resolution notification must include corrective action(s) taken or to be taken by the PACE organization as a result of the grievance, and when the participant may expect corrective action(s) to occur. In the example we used earlier, we noted that during the investigation into the home care aide not cleaning the kitchen, the PACE organization discovered that the home care agency did not have the most current care plan for that participant. The correction that would likely result from that investigation would be to provide the updated care plan to the home care agency and ensure they have received and understand it. This action should be communicated to the participant in order for them to understand how their grievance has been handled and resolved. \nProposed \u00a7 460.120(i)(3) would set \nforth requirements related to how PACE organizations must provide notification when the complaint relates to a Medicare quality of care issue. Specifically, we propose that for Medicare participants, any grievance related to quality of care, regardless of how the grievance is filed, must be responded to in writing. This is consistent with the MA requirement in \u00a7 422.564(e)(3)(iii). As previously discussed, Medicare beneficiaries, and by extension, Medicare participants enrolled in PACE, have the right to submit quality of care grievances and complaints to a QIO under section 1154(a)(14) of the Act. We propose at \u00a7 460.120(i)(3) that, when a grievance relates to a Medicare quality of care issue, the PACE organization must provide a written grievance resolution notification that describes the right of a Medicare participant or other individual specified in \u00a7 460.120(d) acting on behalf of a Medicare participant to file a written complaint with the QIO with regard to Medicare covered services. The only exception to this requirement to provide a written resolution notice \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00218 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a59a695-8efd-4873-9479-430919bdcc43": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a59a695-8efd-4873-9479-430919bdcc43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "264d9132-7edc-40a2-bd54-b2a730589476", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "08486d4cb691da46d4326e62245fadc3855d80e5c8f7d8073ba8833c4de29fe7"}, "3": {"node_id": "4695b752-7655-4040-8a61-ebecabae7fa6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3121538f972cbc914fb706d66e3ac58091aae2142e94fbaa9b026ee411f45c4a"}}, "hash": "bd1e3f92dcbf9fd79f504a814cf8d590bd39b33cde6065039040f94a08f6497e", "text": "79669 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nwould be when the submitter \nspecifically requests not to receive notification as specified in proposed \u00a7 460.120(i)(4), which is discussed in more detail in this section of this proposed rule. We also propose to specify that for any complaint submitted to a QIO, the PACE organization must cooperate with the QIO in resolving the complaint. This language is consistent with the language used in the MA program, and therefore we are proposing it be added to the PACE regulations as well. Because the QIO\u2019s statutory function related to review of quality of care concerns and responses to beneficiary complaints is only applicable to Medicare services and only available to Medicare beneficiaries, and because PACE organizations may have some participants who are not Medicare beneficiaries and may cover non-Medicare services, we expect PACE organizations to work with participants to help them understand whether their grievance relates to a Medicare quality of care issue. \nWe propose to establish at new \n\u00a7 460.120(i)(4) that the PACE organization may withhold notification of the grievance resolution if the individual who submitted the grievance specifically requests not to receive notification of the grievance resolution, and the PACE organization has documented this request in writing. We have heard through our auditing experience that some participants may wish to remain anonymous and some may want to submit a complaint, but they may not wish to receive any notification of the resolution. In order to balance the need for an organization to track and process grievances, with respect for the preferences of participants who wish to not receive communications related to the resolution of a grievance after submitting the initial complaint, we propose to specify in new \u00a7 460.120(i)(4) that PACE participants must have an option to request not to receive any further communication or notification of the grievance resolution following their initial complaint submission. In order for a PACE organization to withhold notification of the grievance resolution for participants who request to exercise this option, the PACE organization would be required to document the participant\u2019s request in writing. We propose to include in new \u00a7 460.120(i)(4) language that provides that the PACE organization would still be responsible for all other parts of this section. \nSection 460.120(d) specifies that the \nPACE organization must continue to \nfurnish all required services to the participant during the grievance \nprocess. We propose to redesignate current \u00a7 460.120(d) as \u00a7 460.120(j) to account for our other proposals. \nCurrently, \u00a7 460.120(e) requires a \nPACE organization to discuss with and provide to the participant in writing the specific steps, including the timeframes for response, that will be taken to resolve the participant\u2019s grievance. We believe our proposals at \u00a7 460.120(c) and \u00a7 460.120(i) would ensure that PACE participants receive sufficient notification regarding both the general grievance process and how a specific grievance was resolved. Therefore, we propose to remove current \u00a7 460.120(e). \nWe propose to add a new paragraph \n\u00a7 460.120(k) that would redesignate and modify the requirement that is currently included at \u00a7 460.120(c)(4). Specifically, we are proposing that the PACE organization must develop and implement procedures to ensure that they maintain the confidentiality of a grievance, including protecting the identity of any individuals involved in the grievance from other employees and contractors when appropriate. As we stated when discussing the proposed notification requirements at \u00a7 460.120(i)(4), we understand that some grievances may be sensitive and some participants or other submitters may wish for their complaint to be kept confidential. For example, if a participant has a complaint related to their physical therapist, that participant may not want the physical therapist to be aware of the complaint. We expect that organizations consider these situations, and have a method for participants that may want certain information to be kept confidential. There may be instances where a person submitting the complaint may want their identity to be protected, or where the complaint involves a sensitive matter where the identity of all individuals may need to be protected, and we would expect the PACE organization to have a process for ensuring that there is a way to maintain the confidentiality of the identity of any individual involved in the grievance from other employees or contractors when it is appropriate. However, we would reiterate that accepting and processing a confidential grievance would not negate the PACE organization\u2019s responsibilities to investigating and resolving the grievance. It also would not negate the responsibilities to document, aggregate and analyze the grievance, as required under current \u00a7 460.120(f).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4695b752-7655-4040-8a61-ebecabae7fa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4695b752-7655-4040-8a61-ebecabae7fa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "264d9132-7edc-40a2-bd54-b2a730589476", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "08486d4cb691da46d4326e62245fadc3855d80e5c8f7d8073ba8833c4de29fe7"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a59a695-8efd-4873-9479-430919bdcc43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bd1e3f92dcbf9fd79f504a814cf8d590bd39b33cde6065039040f94a08f6497e"}}, "hash": "3121538f972cbc914fb706d66e3ac58091aae2142e94fbaa9b026ee411f45c4a", "text": "Also, as we discussed earlier, we have heard from \nmultiple PACE participants that sometimes participants or their family members are afraid to complain to the \nPACE organization for fear of reprisal. While we require a PACE organization to ensure that confidentiality of a grievance is maintained, we also want to remind PACE organizations that participants have the right to submit grievances without fear of reprisal. We have heard through oversight and monitoring activities that participants are afraid that they will lose necessary services, or not be approved for services, if they complain regarding the care received by an organization. PACE organizations should ensure that all participants understand that they are free to complain without any fear of reprisal, regardless of what their grievance is about. \nWe propose to add a new paragraph \nat \u00a7 460.120(l) that aligns with the record keeping requirements for service determination requests, which are set forth at \u00a7 460.121(m). Specifically, proposed \u00a7 460.120(l) would require that a PACE organization must establish and implement a process to document, track, and maintain records related to all processing requirements for grievances received both orally and in writing. These records, except for information deemed confidential as a part of \u00a7 460.120(k), must be available to the IDT to ensure that all members remain alert to pertinent participant information. We expect that PACE organizations have appropriate mechanisms in place for documenting all complaints, including ensuring that oral complaints are documented appropriately, and that written complaints are maintained as required in \u00a7 460.200(d)(2). We believe that proposed \u00a7 460.120(k), similar to the \u00a7 460.121(m) service determination request, would ensure that all relevant parts of the grievance process are documented, including details of the investigation, the findings, any corrective action that was taken, and the notification (oral and/or written) that was provided to the participant of the resolution. \nFinally, current \u00a7 460.120(f) requires \nPACE organizations to maintain, aggregate, and analyze information on grievance proceedings. This information must be used in the PACE organization\u2019s quality improvement program. We are proposing to redesignate this as paragraph (m) to account for our other proposals. We are also proposing to remove the word \u2018\u2018maintain\u2019\u2019 that appears in the current regulation text, since the requirement to maintain records has been added to the proposed paragraph (l).

We note that this requirement applies to all grievances; oral or written, including anonymous grievances. We have seen through audit that some organizations do not include all grievances as a part of their internal quality improvement analysis. It is important that PACE organizations consider all complaints that constitute a grievance in order for them to make adequate improvements to their program. \nWe estimate a one-time burden for \nPACE organizations to update their grievance materials to meet these proposed requirements. We do not believe there will be a change in annual burden as a PACE organization is already required to provide notification to participants on their grievance resolution, and may opt to do so orally or in writing. Therefore, we believe that the ongoing burden will not change with this proposal. We discuss and account for the one-time burden for PACE organizations to update their grievance materials to meet the proposed new requirements in the Collection of Information Requirements section. We will submit these changes to OMB for approval under control number 0938\u20130790 (CMS\u2013R\u2013244).

Service Determination Request \n(\u00a7 460.121) \nSections 1894(b)(2)(B) and \n1934(b)(2)(B) of the Act specify that PACE organizations must have in effect written safeguards of the rights of enrolled participant, including procedures for grievances and appeals. Along with the regulations at \u00a7 460.120 related to grievances, and \u00a7 460.122 related to appeals, CMS created a process for service determination requests, the first stage of an appeal, at \u00a7 460.121. \nA service determination request is \ndefined at \u00a7 460.121(b)(1) as a request to initiate a service, to modify an existing service, including to increase, reduce, eliminate, or otherwise change a service, or to continue coverage of a service that the PACE organization is recommending be discontinued or reduced. Once a service determination request is received by the full IDT, the IDT must make a decision on the request and provide notification of its decision as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires, but no later than 3 calendar days after the date the IDT receives the request, except that the IDT \nmay extend the timeframe for review and notification by up to 5 calendar days if the extension requirements as specified in \u00a7 460.121(i)(1) are met. When CMS proposed\n223to require \nservice determination request extension notifications in \u00a7 460.121(i)(2), we based the requirement on the MA organization determination requirements in \u00a7 422.568, which require written notification when an extension is taken. Comments submitted by PACE organizations and industry advocacy groups regarding our proposal to require written notification of extensions recommended we allow either oral or written notification when the IDT extends the timeframe for a service determination request, rather than requiring written notification only. At the time, we did not finalize the change to allow oral or written notification for extension requests, and we explained that we believed written notification of the extension was important in order to ensure the participant received a full explanation. Additionally, we explained that providing written notification of the extension would allow the participant to share the information with family members or caregivers, if desired (86 FR 6022). \nSince that rule was finalized, PACE \norganizations have had an opportunity to implement the provision and assess whether written notification is practical for all extensions. Additionally, since the rule was finalized, PACE organizations have been operating under a worldwide pandemic, which has required organizations to increase their ability to engage participants in new ways through the use of remote technology, and utilizing different means of communicating orally has become more prevalent and has proven an effective way to communicate important information quickly. For \nthese reasons, we are now proposing to revise the requirement in \u00a7 460.121(i)(2) to allow the IDT to provide notification either orally or in writing to the participant or their designated representative when the IDT extends the timeframe for a service determination request, as permitted under \u00a7 460.121(i)(1). Allowing the IDT to provide either oral or written notice of service determination request extensions would increase operational flexibility for PACE organizations without compromising participant safeguards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f47b50-ae2d-485f-9f1a-d9c65316055a": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f47b50-ae2d-485f-9f1a-d9c65316055a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "904cf04e-313c-4d43-95d3-8b94619980db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "3aaab829e661bd44229635ad615b3db32e92c0946c64746b6d61e3403ed9e8f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "324897a5-d36a-4afd-b506-dcb3df27262b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ce08e674a5c5694dcb93bef9a0bf59cc0f0f0c6f43917637ddcc44274c7c694e"}}, "hash": "a3ab67eb897725d6df55a544f9412d86be4a1d399b355183651f0b9616a07a82", "text": "In order to ensure participants are fully informed of the reason(s) for an extension, we expect oral notice of the service determination \nrequest extensions to meet the same requirements as written notice, including the expectations that notices will explain the reason(s) for the delay and be issued as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s condition requires, but no later than 24 hours after the IDT decides to extend the timeframe. We also expect that PACE organizations would document the content of oral notifications of service determination request extensions in accordance with \u00a7 460.121(m). An IDT may choose to provide the extension notification both orally and in writing if it believes that is necessary to ensure the participant\u2019s understanding. \nWe estimate ongoing burden \nreduction due to the expected decrease in written notifications of service determination request extensions in favor of oral notification.

Further, in the final rule titled \u2018\u2018Medicare Program; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs\u2019\u2019 (75 FR 19677), which appeared in the April 15, 2010 issue of the Federal Register, CMS explained that \u2018\u2018our intent is to invoke this disclosure authority when we become aware that a sponsoring organization has serious compliance or performance deficiencies such as those that may lead to an intermediate sanction or require immediate correction and where we believe beneficiaries should be specifically notified. One example of a situation where enrollees should be notified of performance or compliance deficiencies would be when a sponsoring organization fails to provide beneficiaries with the proper premium notices to collect premium amounts in arrears. Another example would be if a sponsoring organization failed to provide access to services and we instructed the sponsor to contact enrollees regarding this issue and assist them with obtaining needed services or medications. In each of these situations we would require a sponsoring organization to disclose the deficiency to its enrollees and take affirmative steps to alleviate any problems for enrollees, such as providing enrollees with options to fix the issue\u2019\u2019 (75 FR 19734\u201319735). \nIn contrast to the Part C and D \nregulations at Parts 422 and 423, respectively, the PACE regulations at Part 460 do not include a requirement for PACE organizations to notify current and potential PACE participants of the organization\u2019s performance and contract compliance deficiencies. In addition, we note that although regulations at Part 423 generally apply to PACE organizations, \u00a7 423.128 was waived for PACE organizations in 2005 (see January \nPart D 2005 final rule (70 FR 4430, 4432\u20134433)). However, we believe the disclosure of this information would serve as an important protection for PACE participants, as it would help to ensure current and potential PACE participants and their caregivers have adequate information to make informed decisions about whether to enroll in or to continue their enrollment with a PACE organization. PACE participants that are enrolled in the organization and their caregivers should have notice of the PACE organization\u2019s performance \nand compliance deficiencies in order to assess whether they have experienced similar issues that must be addressed by the PACE organization. In addition, for participants that are looking to enroll in a PACE organization, it is important they understand any potential issues that they may experience if they proceed with their enrollment. Finally, it is important to ensure there is public transparency regarding a PACE organization that has, or has had, performance and contract compliance deficiencies. \nTherefore, effective beginning in CY \n2024, we propose to amend the regulations at Part 460 by adding \u00a7 460.198, which would require PACE organizations to disclose to current PACE participants and potential PACE participants information specific to PACE organization performance and contract compliance deficiencies, in a manner specified by CMS. As in the MA and Part D programs, we anticipate that we would invoke the disclosure requirement when we become aware that a PACE organization has serious compliance or performance deficiencies such as those that may lead to intermediate sanctions or requires immediate correction, and where we believe PACE participants and potential PACE participants should be specifically notified. \nConsistent with \u00a7 423.128(d), CMS \nwaives any provision of the Part D regulations to the extent that CMS determines that the provision is duplicative of, or conflicts with, a provision otherwise applicable to PACE \norganizations under sections 1894 or 1934 of the Act, or as necessary to promote coordination between Part D and PACE. Because sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act do not include a requirement for PACE organizations to notify current and potential PACE participants of the organization\u2019s performance and contract compliance deficiencies, the regulation at \u00a7 423.128(f) does not duplicate, conflict with, or impede coordination between Part D and PACE. In addition, we note that, at the time CMS announced the waiver of \u00a7 423.128 in the January Part D 2005 final rule (see 70 FR 4432\u20134433), \nthe disclosure requirement in paragraph (f) did not appear in \u00a7 423.128.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91de0815-6940-4d45-9294-3b8810d80a16": {"__data__": {"id_": "91de0815-6940-4d45-9294-3b8810d80a16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aed6be1a-4b81-4c47-9b34-8ffb227583e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "ff7303c28d8f675117ad0a8a6dbd2e84e9c868009791e5a9e2f9954bf0b7cd03"}, "2": {"node_id": "600b306b-b05d-44a3-8c21-d5ea1f23fa46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "54165d272e6a9a8e9db68504eb9cd33f28e8ba572dd397603b0b4e04c95a9eca"}}, "hash": "bbcf3ffeb010b05b350d7f5539c214c9b26f1413e86432e532287f607857d047", "text": "224 \nTherefore, we believe the 2005 waiver of the rest of \u00a7 423.128 does not apply to \u00a7 423.128(f), and the disclosure of information regarding performance and contract deficiencies concerning a PACE organization in its capacity as a Part D sponsor would serve as an important \nprotection for PACE participants, as it would help to ensure current and potential PACE participants and their caregivers have adequate information to make informed decisions about whether to enroll in or to continue their enrollment with a PACE organization. This proposed rule does not impact the waiver of the remainder of \u00a7 423.128 for PACE organizations, as applicable. \nN. PACE Maintenance of Records \n(\u00a7\u00a7 460.200 and 460.210) \nUnder sections 1894(b) and 1934(b) of \nthe Act, PACE organizations are required to provide all items and services covered under Medicare and Medicaid, and all additional items and services specified in regulations and determined necessary by the interdisciplinary team to improve and maintain the participant\u2019s overall health status. Currently, PACE organizations are required to safeguard data and records in accordance with \u00a7 460.200(d). PACE organizations must also maintain a single comprehensive medical record for each participant in accordance with accepted professional standards (\u00a7 460.210(a)(1)). \nIn the February 2020 proposed rule \n(85 FR 9002), CMS proposed to add a new requirement at \u00a7 460.200(d)(2) for PACE organizations to maintain in the medical record all written communications received from participants or other parties in their original form when the communications relate to a participant\u2019s care, health, or safety in accordance with \u00a7 460.210(b)(6). We explained in the proposed rule that we had found through our monitoring of PACE organizations that they do not always maintain and safeguard important records such as communications related to a participant\u2019s care from family members, caregivers, and the participant\u2019s community (85 FR 9134). We stated that maintaining a comprehensive, complete, and accurate medical record allows a PACE organization to remain alert to all information that is relevant to a participant\u2019s care, health and safety, and to provide appropriate and timely care \nto the participant (85 FR 9140). Therefore, we also proposed a new requirement at \u00a7 460.210(b)(6) for PACE organizations to maintain in a participant\u2019s medical record original documentation of any written communication the PACE organization receives relating to the care, health or safety of a participant, in any format (for example, emails, faxes, letters, etc.) and including, but not limited to (i) communications from the participant, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00221 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bab1c33e-83c5-416f-895e-ea894300424a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bab1c33e-83c5-416f-895e-ea894300424a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64ef7770-6113-4b98-af13-a0cb95214d88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5878ce5a5206c65e9a7f4400362dc29ff7549460c7f8ddc64c84d3e8e4ce7602"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1eae148-df72-41cc-bc90-6a5aa7436b48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a8fffb1ec598de33a50d8d28e781e1b1bf5ccb14ae768328b3774627915b72ac"}}, "hash": "a806078f208d8c9e4ae31c47bcc8973fa3eaa210a5d3bc94208738062df80689", "text": "79672 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nhis or her designated representative, a \nfamily member, a caregiver, or any other individual who provides information pertinent to a participant\u2019s health or safety or both; and (ii) communications from an advocacy or governmental agency such as State-based Adult Protective Services. \nIn the January 2021 final rule, CMS \nsummarized and responded to the comments received on these proposed record maintenance requirements (86 FR 6039 through 6040). We noted that some commenters recommended we allow PACE organizations to maintain original communications outside of the \nmedical record systems, as they believed that maintaining original documentation of any written communication relating to the care, health or safety of a participant in any format in the medical record would \ncompromise the usefulness of the medical record, due to the quantity of information that would be required to be stored (86 FR 6040). Based on these comments, we contemplated allowing original documentation of communications to be summarized in the medical record, so long as PACE organizations maintained the original documentation of the communication in a separate system. Ultimately, we chose not to modify our proposal with the contemplated change of permitting PACE organizations to summarize written communications relating to the care, health, or safety of a participant in the medical record. We did, however, modify our original proposal to allow PACE organizations to maintain in a participant\u2019s medical record original documentation, or an electronic copy, of any written communication the PACE organization receives relating to the care, health or safety of a participant. In finalizing this provision, we explained that we were not establishing specific requirements governing where affected communications must be stored within a participant\u2019s medical record. We also explained that PACE organizations may operationalize these requirements in accordance with the capabilities of their medical record systems (86 FR 6040). \nParticipants, their family members, \nand representatives have a longstanding right to file a grievance expressing dissatisfaction with the delivery of PACE services or the quality of care furnished as part of the PACE benefit package (see \u00a7\u00a7 460.112(g)(1) and 460.120). A PACE organization must have a formal written process to evaluate and resolve medical and non- medical grievances by PACE participants (\u00a7 460.120(a)). A PACE \norganization\u2019s grievance process must include a written procedure for maintaining the confidentiality of a \nparticipant\u2019s grievance (\u00a7 460.120(c)(4)). \nPACE participants routinely file \ngrievances with a PACE organization under the assumption that the details of their grievance will be kept confidential. This is especially important to PACE participants when a grievance involves a particular staff member of the PACE organization (for example, a home care aide, a driver, or a specific member of the interdisciplinary team). PACE organizations have typically maintained confidentiality of this information by only allowing access to the information, that is, the details of the complaint, to a limited number of PACE organization staff and/or by storing this information outside of the medical record in a secure location (for example, a separate electronic application or paper-based system). \nSince we finalized the January 2021 \nfinal rule, PACE organizations have had an opportunity to implement this provision, and we have continued to receive questions related to maintaining original communications in the medical record. These questions and comments indicate that as PACE organizations have begun to operationalize this requirement, they have been challenged with maintaining the confidentiality of grievances and managing the volume of these communications in the medical record. Other inquires include whether it would be permissible for PACE organizations to scan communications and store them electronically in the medical record. \nIn addition to the concerns around \nmaintaining the confidentiality of grievances, PACE organizations have also pointed out that there are instances when written communications sent to the PACE organization by the individuals and entities listed at \u00a7 460.210(b)(6)(i) and (ii) may contain sensitive information about a PACE participant, their caregivers, and/or family members, and that these communications are often accompanied by a request to keep the information private. For example, information shared with a PACE organization may pertain to a caregiver\u2019s health, and may have implications for the participant\u2019s care, and the caregiver may only want the details of this information shared among employees and contractors who \nneed to know the information rather than all individuals with access to the participant\u2019s medical record. There are also instances when the communications include contents or language that may be inappropriate for inclusion in the medical record, such as vulgar comments directed towards individual PACE staff.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1eae148-df72-41cc-bc90-6a5aa7436b48": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1eae148-df72-41cc-bc90-6a5aa7436b48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64ef7770-6113-4b98-af13-a0cb95214d88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "5878ce5a5206c65e9a7f4400362dc29ff7549460c7f8ddc64c84d3e8e4ce7602"}, "2": {"node_id": "bab1c33e-83c5-416f-895e-ea894300424a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a806078f208d8c9e4ae31c47bcc8973fa3eaa210a5d3bc94208738062df80689"}}, "hash": "a8fffb1ec598de33a50d8d28e781e1b1bf5ccb14ae768328b3774627915b72ac", "text": "PACE organization staff have indicated that \nmaintaining written communications related to participant grievances in the medical record allows access to the information by all PACE organization staff, thereby jeopardizing the confidentiality of such communications, and have therefore requested clarification from CMS on how to adhere to comply with the requirement in \u00a7 460.210(b)(6) when the original communication is part of a participant grievance and contains sensitive or confidential information. \nSections 1894(f)(3) and 1934(f)(3) of \nthe Act provide authority for the establishment of certain additional beneficiary and program protections applicable to MA and Medicaid managed care programs under prepaid capitation agreements under section 1903(m) of the Act. Sections 1894(b)(2) and 1934(b)(2) of the Act require that the PACE program agreement have written safeguards of the rights of enrolled participants, including a bill of rights and procedures for grievances and appeals, in accordance with regulations and with other Federal and State laws designed for the protection of beneficiaries. This authority allows CMS to implement regulations to ensure that PACE participants\u2019 rights are protected, including the right to file a grievance anonymously. \nTo uphold participant rights and help \nPACE organizations to safeguard anonymity to the extent possible during the grievance process and in other circumstances that involve sensitive information, CMS now proposes, using the authority at sections 1894(f)(3) and 1934(f)(3) of the Act, to amend the PACE regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 460.200(d)(2) and 460.210(b)(6) to allow for more administrative flexibility in how PACE organizations maintain written communications relating to the care, health, or safety of a participant. \nSpecifically, we propose to amend \n\u00a7 460.200(d)(2) to require that a PACE organization must maintain all written communications received in any format (for example, emails, faxes, letters, etc.) from participants or other parties in their original form when the communications relate to a participant\u2019s care, health, or safety, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) communications from the participant, \nhis or her designated representative, a family member, a caregiver, or any other individual who provides information pertinent to a participant\u2019s care, health or safety; and (ii) communications from an advocacy or governmental agency, such as Adult Protective Services.

By moving this language to \u00a7 460.200(d)(2), with the proposed modifications, we would retain the requirement for PACE organizations to maintain these important communications in their original form, while removing the requirement that these communications be stored in the participant\u2019s medical record. At \u00a7 460.210(b)(6), we propose to replace the current language with a new requirement that states that original documentation or an unaltered electronic copy, of any written communication as described in \u00a7 460.200(d)(2), must be maintained in the participant\u2019s medical record unless the following requirements are met: (i) \nthe medical record contains a thorough and accurate summary of the communication including all relevant aspects of the communication, (ii) original documentation of the communication is maintained outside of the medical record and is accessible by employees and contractors of the PACE organization when necessary, and in accordance with \u00a7 460.200(e), and (iii) original documentation of the communication is available to CMS and the SAA upon request. This proposal would continue to require PACE organizations to ensure that these important communications relating to the care, health, or safety of a participant are included in the medical record, but it would allow PACE organizations operational flexibility on how these communications are included. PACE organizations would be permitted, under this proposal, to summarize the information in the medical record, as long as the summary is accurate and thorough, and the original documentation of the communication is maintained outside the medical record and is accessible by the PACE organization\u2019s employees and contractors as needed, and available to CMS and the SAA upon request. We believe this proposal would balance CMS\u2019 interest in ensuring these communications are safeguarded with PACE organizations\u2019 interest in ensuring the medical record is usable and that confidential information may be protected to the extent possible. A PACE organization would be able to include a summary of the information but could \nchoose to exclude names or other potentially sensitive information, provided the requirements under proposed \u00a7 460.210(b)(6)(i) through (iii) have been met. \nO. PACE Participant Health Outcomes \nData (\u00a7 460.202) \nSections 1894(e)(3)(A) and \n1934(e)(3)(A) of the Act require PACE organizations to collect, maintain, and report data necessary to monitor the operation, cost, and effectiveness of the PACE program to CMS and the State administering agency (SAA). \nFollowing publication of the 1999 \nPACE interim final rule, CMS established a set of participant health outcomes data that PACE organizations were required to report to CMS. In subsequent years, we have modified the participant health outcomes data on a routine basis to ensure that we are collecting data that is relevant and useful to our efforts to monitor and oversee the PACE program. According to 5 CFR 1320.15, at least once every 3 years, in order to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104\u201313) (PRA), CMS is required to publish the proposed data collection and solicit public comment. The data collection requirements related to participant health outcomes data can be found in the information collection request currently approved under OMB control number 0938\u20131264 (CMS\u2013 10525). Section 460.202 currently requires participant health outcomes data reported to CMS and the SAA to be specified in the PACE program agreement; however, CMS does not routinely update program agreements based on changes to the required participant health outcomes data. As a \nresult, the quality data collection specified in the program agreement is often out of date and no longer applicable within a few years. \nSince the participant health outcomes \ndata that PACE organizations must report to CMS and the SAA are specified and routinely updated through the PRA process which requires CMS to publish and solicit comments on these data, we propose to amend paragraph (b) of \u00a7 460.202 by striking the final sentence, which states, \u2018\u2018The items collected are specified in the PACE program agreement.\u2019\u2019 This change would eliminate confusion regarding where the data collection requirements may be found.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60c4db8a-5ec1-4e17-9051-3cb807c88019": {"__data__": {"id_": "60c4db8a-5ec1-4e17-9051-3cb807c88019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "966abfcf-2260-4d4a-8652-ce18468d822b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "60eeb5679e47ab95f302378746d0a5a7842cdca10ea0e18b8bf7246b73d7f6e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "44d7d305-9592-4816-b499-e00e1c8193c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f9119bbd8b2697bc7d6a6e1954585be46f6098ca70625910468442fb57d1edba"}}, "hash": "bd1e235dd747f97f51fa4045aa350039e7250cd6083cf6dd4bc9f8f1c0a0d46b", "text": "The PACE program agreement would still include a statement of the data collected, as required by \u00a7 460.32(a)(11), but it would not include the level of specificity regarding the data collection that is included in the CMS PRA information collection request approved under OMB control number 0938\u20131264. We believe that by modifying \u00a7 460.202 as proposed we would not be increasing the burden on PACE organizations as they are currently required to furnish information to CMS and the SAA through the aforementioned information collection request. \nVII. Collection of Information \nRequirements \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act \nof 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), we are required to provide 60-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public comment before a \u2018\u2018collection of information,\u2019\u2019 as defined under 5 CFR 1320.3(c) of the PRA\u2019s implementing regulations, is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection requirement should be approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we solicit comment on the following issues: \n\u2022The need for the information \ncollection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper functions of our agency. \n\u2022The accuracy of our estimate of the \ninformation collection burden. \n\u2022The quality, utility, and clarity of \nthe information to be collected. \n\u2022Recommendations to minimize the \ninformation collection burden on the affected public, including automated collection techniques.

Proposed Information Collection \nRequirements (ICRs) \nThe following ICRs are listed in the \norder of appearance within the preamble (see sections II. through VI.) of this proposed rule. \n1. ICRs Regarding Applying D\u2013SNP \nLook-Alike Requirements To Plan Benefit Package Segments (\u00a7 422.514) \nWe propose adding a new paragraph \nat \u00a7 422.514(g) to clarify that the D\u2013SNP look-alike contracting limitations at \u00a7 422.514(d) through (f) apply to segments of the MA plan. This new paragraph will address instances we have seen since adopting \u00a7 422.514(d) through (f) where a specific segment of an MA plan looks like a D\u2013SNP look- alike and would be subject to the contracting prohibitions in \u00a7 422.514(d) if the segment were treated as an MA plan. We believe that by applying the D\u2013SNP look-alike contracting limitations only at the MA plan level without applying it to segments of plans, our existing regulation has an \nunintended and unforeseen loophole through which D\u2013SNP look-alikes could persist, contrary to the stated objectives in our prior rulemaking. \nBased on January 2022 Monthly \nMembership Report data, we estimate that the proposed change would result in three MA plan segments being identified as D\u2013SNP look-alikes, and these D\u2013SNP look-alikes would likely transition the approximately 3,000 current enrollees into another MA\u2013PD plan offered by the same MA organization (or by another MA organization with the same parent organization as the MA organization) using the transition process described in \u00a7 422.514(e). Based on our analysis of proposed D\u2013SNP look-alike transitions for contract year 2023, two D\u2013SNP look- alikes in contract year 2022 are proposing to transition a combined total of approximately 7,000 D\u2013SNP look- alike enrollees into two new non-SNP MA plan segments, which could create two new D\u2013SNP look-alikes for contract year 2023. \nIn the June 2020 final rule (85 FR \n33877 through 33880), we estimated each D\u2013SNP look-alike would take a one-time effort of 2 hours for a business operations specialist to submit all enrollment changes to CMS necessary to complete the transition process. We also stated that, after the prohibition on D\u2013 SNP look-alikes was implemented, at most five plans per year would be identified as D\u2013SNP look-alikes under \u00a7 422.514(d) due to meeting the \nenrollment threshold for dually eligible individuals or operating in a State that will begin contracting with D\u2013SNPs or other integrated plans. These estimates were submitted to OMB for approval under control numbers 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267). In association with our June 2020 final rule, the requirement and burden estimates (5 respondents, 5 total responses, and 10 total hours) were approved by OMB under control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267). \nOur proposed clarification at \n\u00a7 422.514(g) does not change the transition process nor our burden estimates. Additionally, the proposed addition of non-SNP MA plan segments to the contracting limitations at \u00a7 422.514 does not change our estimates that at most five plans (including PBP segments) per year would be identified as D\u2013SNP look-alikes; therefore, the estimated number of respondents and burden estimates in control numbers 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267) would not change. \n2. ICRs Regarding Transitional Coverage \nand Retroactive Medicare Part D Coverage for Certain Low-Income Beneficiaries Through the LI NET Program (\u00a7 423.2500 Through \u00a7 423.2536) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u2013TBD (CMS\u2013 10831). At this time, the control number has yet to be determined, but will be assigned by OMB upon their clearance of this proposed rule\u2019s collection of \ninformation request.

Some beneficiaries, called \u2018\u2018immediate need beneficiaries\u2019\u2019 may enroll in LI NET at the point-of-sale (POS) at a pharmacy because they are likely eligible for the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS), have immediate need for their prescription, and do not have Part D coverage. Some beneficiaries submit receipts for reimbursement for claims paid out of pocket; if they are eligible for LI NET they will be retroactively enrolled into the LI NET program by the LI NET sponsor. Another way for beneficiaries to potentially enrollment into LI NET is by complete an LI NET application form. \nTo estimate the total burden, we \nconsider the burden for enrollees, pharmacists, and Part D sponsors separately. Each consideration entails counting the number of documents \narising from point of sale enrollments, direct reimbursement forms, and LI NET application forms. \nFor Beneficiaries: To estimate the \ninformation collection burden for beneficiaries, we have estimated the number of beneficiaries submitting information to LI NET and time related to handling the information. We have not included burden estimates for individuals who would not be providing documentation, such as those CMS automatically enrolls into LI NET, individuals whose eligibility for LI NET is confirmed independently by the LI NET sponsor, or for those who opt not to provide evidence. \nWhen enrolling in LI NET at POS, \npossible forms of evidence for LIS eligibility include but are not limited to, a Medicaid card, an LIS award letter, or a declaration to the pharmacist of LIS applicant status. We estimate that it would take an individual approximately 15 minutes (0.25 hr) to gather supporting documentation. There are 36,722 individuals enrolled in the LI NET demonstration at POS in 2021 who will apply at the point of sale. Based on our experience with the LI NET demonstration, we estimate approximately 250 beneficiaries would submit receipts for reimbursement for claims paid out of pocket. These beneficiaries may complete a direct reimbursement request form available online, and return by mail, email, or fax, together with their receipt, to the LI NET sponsor. In the LI NET demonstration, approximately ten beneficiaries per year complete the LI NET application form, which is available online, and return it to the LI NET sponsor by mail, email, or fax. Thus, in total we expect 36,982 beneficiaries (36,722 at point of sale plus 250 through direct reimbursement plus 10 applying via the LI NET application form) to spend 15 minutes (0.25 hr) resulting in an aggregate \nburden of 9,246 hours (36,982 enrollees * 0.25 hr) at an aggregate cost of $258,980 (9,246 hr. * $28.01/hr). \nFor the Private Sector (Pharmacists): \nWe estimate that it will take 2 minutes (0.0333 hr) for a pharmacy to fax the documentation to the LI NET sponsor. However, pharmacists will not process the forms of enrollees who use direct reimbursement or the LI NET application form. Thus, pharmacists will only process the 36,722 enrollees at point of sale. Thus, the aggregate burden for pharmacists is 1,223 hours (36,722 enrollees * 0.0333 hr) at an aggregate cost of $147,812 (1,223 hr * $120.86). \nFor Part D Sponsors: The Part D \nsponsors will process the documents \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00225 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e973618a-2157-41f6-814e-601c12b67d86": {"__data__": {"id_": "e973618a-2157-41f6-814e-601c12b67d86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a43a6d49-ba98-4d08-b0ec-93dc2211aefc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e40ea634b1c8f4ebd5fc0dc7d712c84f0459a32dba7c9b710b3ffa5fb9a8440a"}, "3": {"node_id": "53243c97-a9e9-4c69-b75c-0297259e9004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37a543cce6b46af41c28b40fc7cb9da9f436698a0b64c8aaf3d4d5c6b888ae2e"}}, "hash": "67b298927b6a9676c11d0e5bf01afa0b1ec5220ab5d42f1b9f3446bb37b06264", "text": "79676 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nreceived from all 36,982 enrollees. Part \nD sponsors are estimated to spend about 2 minutes (0.0333 hr.) to fax information and to CMS and process information. Thus, the aggregate burden for Part D sponsors is 1,232 hours (36,982 enrollees * 0.0333 hr) at an aggregate cost of $93,878 (1,232 hr * $76.20/hr). \n3. ICRs Regarding Adding New \nBehavioral Health Specialty Types Subject to Network Adequacy Evaluation (\u00a7 422.116) \nIn order to ensure that MA enrollees \nhave access to provider networks sufficient to provide covered services, including behavioral health service providers, we are proposing to add new specialty types that will be subject to network adequacy evaluation under \u00a7 422.116. We are proposing to add Clinical Psychology, Clinical Social Work and Prescribers of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder under \n\u00a7 422.116(b)(1). \nTo determine the potential burden \nregarding this proposal, we considered cost estimates for CMS making programming updates to the HPMS system, which is utilized to conduct automated reviews; additional burden, including updating policies and procedures, for CMS contractor; and additional burden, including updating policies and procedures, for MA organizations. \nWe have determined that there is a $0 \ncost for programming HPMS with regard to this proposal. Adding new specialty types to the automated review conducted by HPMS would be covered under funding currently in place for updating the system. \nThe CMS contractor does not indicate \nany additional costs to carry out the work required by this proposal, therefore there is no impact. \nWe have determined that there is a $0 \ncost for MA organizations in regards to reporting new specialty types to CMS for their network adequacy reviews as this proposal requires. However, we have determined that there is a minimal one-time cost for MA organizations to update their policies and procedures associated with this proposal. \nFirst, regarding reporting the \nproposed new specialty types to CMS, MA organizations are already conducting ongoing work related to network adequacy reviews that happen during the initial or service area application, or every three years for the triennial review. Further, organizations should already have these specialty provider types within network, as these are services covered by Medicare Part A and B and which are furnished by these specialty types, so there is no burden related to contracting with new provider \ntypes. This proposal would only require that the proposed specialty types be added to the Health Services Delivery (HSD) tables during any network adequacy evaluation requested by CMS. The time to conduct tasks related to adding additional specialty types on the HSD tables is negligible. \nWe understand that MA organizations \nwill need to update their policies and procedures related to submission of HSD tables to ensure that the new required behavioral health specialty types are included. We estimate that a business operations specialist working at an hourly wage of $76.20/hr will take five minutes (0.0833 hr) for a one-time update of policies and procedures related to this task, at a cost of $6.35 (0.0833 hr * $76.20/hr). The aggregate burden is 62 hours (742 MA contracts * 0.0833) at a cost $4,724 (62 hours * 76.20/hr). \nThese changes will be submitted to \nOMB for approval under control number OMB 0938\u20131346. Subject to renewal, the control number is currently set to expire on November 30, 2024. It was last approved on January 13, 2022 and remains active. \n4. ICRs Regarding Enrollee Notification \nRequirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) Provider Contract Terminations (\u00a7\u00a7 422.111 and 422.2267) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 267). \nAs described in section III.D. of this \nproposed rule, we are proposing to revise: (1) \u00a7 422.111(e) by establishing specific enrollee notification requirements for no-cause and for-cause provider contract terminations and adding specific and more stringent enrollee notification requirements when primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations occur; and (2) \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12) to specify the requirements for the content of the notification to enrollees about a provider contract termination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53243c97-a9e9-4c69-b75c-0297259e9004": {"__data__": {"id_": "53243c97-a9e9-4c69-b75c-0297259e9004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a43a6d49-ba98-4d08-b0ec-93dc2211aefc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e40ea634b1c8f4ebd5fc0dc7d712c84f0459a32dba7c9b710b3ffa5fb9a8440a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e973618a-2157-41f6-814e-601c12b67d86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "67b298927b6a9676c11d0e5bf01afa0b1ec5220ab5d42f1b9f3446bb37b06264"}}, "hash": "37a543cce6b46af41c28b40fc7cb9da9f436698a0b64c8aaf3d4d5c6b888ae2e", "text": "This proposal to amend \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(e) \nand 422.2267(e)(12) would impact MA organizations in terms of the burden required to identify those enrollees who must be notified of provider contract terminations per CMS requirements, to develop and send the required written notices, to develop the scripts for the required telephonic notices, and to make the required enrollee telephone calls and any necessary follow-up calls. However, CMS does not currently collect data regarding the widely variable number of provider contract terminations an MA organization undergoes in a given contract year, nor \nthe number of enrollees affected by each termination. Therefore, we do not have information to estimate the extent of MA provider contract terminations, how many enrollees are affected and need to be notified per \u00a7 422.111(e), or how the MA program would be impacted as we see the effects of the proposed regulation. \nThe actual direct burden of this \nprovision arises from MA organization staff hours spent, resources purchased, and enrollee notifications provided. MA organizations may also differ in how their spending for the proposed requirements evolves over time as they test strategies and redevelop their approaches to complying with the regulation. \nDespite our inability to quantify \ncertain burden for this proposal, we are able to estimate the one-time burden on MA organizations to update their existing written provider termination notice in compliance with the new required notice content that we are proposing at \u00a7 422.2267(e)(12)(ii). We expect MA organizations to engage in some routine software development to update their notice template and related systems to incorporate the new proposed requirements, which we are proposing will be delineated in a provider termination model document developed by CMS staff (thus not incurring COI burden). This proposed model will be posted for public review and comment in conjunction with the proposed rule\u2019s CMS\u2013R\u2013267 PRA package. We estimate that one or two software developers working at a wage of $92.92/hr will spend a total of 8 hours updating an MA organization\u2019s existing provider termination notice template and related systems based on CMS\u2019s model. With approximately 697 \nMA organizations impacted by this proposed change, this results in a total of 5,576 hours (697 MA organizations * 8 hours), at an aggregate cost across all MA organizations of $518,122 (5,576 hours * $92.92/hr). We are unable to estimate the burden for the proposed telephonic notice requirement at proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.111(e)(1)(i) and 422.2267(e)(12)(iii) because the number of primary care and behavioral health provider contract terminations an MA organization undergoes in a given contract year is unknown, as are the number of affected enrollees per termination. \n5.

This rule proposes that MA plans must follow Traditional Medicare coverage criteria as specified in NCDs, LCD, or Medicare laws (that is, in Medicare statutes and regulations). \nThis rule further proposes that in the \nabsence of coverage criteria in an applicable Medicare statute or regulation, NCD or LCD, an MA plan may create internal coverage criteria that are based on current evidence in widely used treatment guidelines or clinical literature and that this evidence must be made publicly available. \nThis rule also proposes a new \nrequirement that in creating these internal policies, MA organizations must provide a publicly accessible summary of evidence that was considered during the development of the internal coverage criteria used to make medical necessity determinations, \na list of the sources of such evidence, and include an explanation of the rationale that supports the adoption of the coverage criteria used to make a medical necessity determination. We expect that each plan annually will have new policies that they create. \nWe believe that the public posting of \nthe summary of evidence used to develop a plan\u2019s internal coverage criteria would require minimal time. We estimate that over the course of a year 2 business days or 16 hours would be an adequate estimate of time needed for a business operations specialist to make all postings. Thus the per contract burden is 16 hours at a cost of $1,219 (16 * $76.20) and the aggregate burden over 697 contracts is 11,152 hours (697 contracts * 16 hours/contract) at a cost of $849,782 (11,152 hr * $76.20/hr) \nWe invite stakeholder comment on all \naspects of this proposal. More specifically, we ask (1) is our assumption that plans are already complying with the requirement of creating new guidance correct? (2) is our assumption of 16 hours annually sufficient? (3) Are there any other aspects of this proposal or its estimates upon which stakeholders have comments? 6. ICRs Regarding Utilization \nManagement Committee (\u00a7 422.137) \nThis rule proposes protections to help \nensure that beneficiaries maintain access to medically necessary Part A and B services and drugs, while permitting MA plans to use utilization management tools, such as prior authorization. This proposed rule requires that MA plans establish and use a committee (similar to a P&T committee) that reviews PA policies annually to ensure the policies are consistent with current traditional Medicare coverage and guidelines in Medicare statutes and regulations, NCDs, and LCDs. This proposed rule requires the committee to review all medical services that require PA and other utilization management policies, at least on an annual basis and to document their findings. Additionally, the committee would be responsible for revising and updating the MA plan\u2019s utilization management policies as needed. \nSpecifically, we propose at 422.137 \n(c)(1) through (4) that the UM committee must clearly articulate and document processes to determine that the committee membership requirements under the proposed 422.137 (c)(1) through (4) of this section have been met, including the determination by an objective party of whether disclosed financial interests are conflicts of interest and the management of any recusals due to such conflicts. We estimate it would take 1 hour at $76.20/ hr for an UM Committee business specialist to perform certain tasks and review and retain documentation and information on an annual basis. Additionally, we propose at \u00a7 422.137(d)(4) and (5) that the committee must document in writing the reason for its decisions regarding the development of UM policies and make this documentation available to CMS upon request. We estimate that it will take 2 hours at $ 76.20/hr for a UM Committee business specialist to capture and retain this required documentation on an annual basis. We invite stakeholder comment on these assumptions. \nThe aggregate burden for each of the \n697 MA plans would be 2,091 hours (697 plans * 3 hours) at a cost of $159,334.2 (2,091 hours * 76.20/hr). 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75371871-39c1-464f-8ff4-ba7f51937057": {"__data__": {"id_": "75371871-39c1-464f-8ff4-ba7f51937057", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "060f32b9-2993-446d-8758-662ff1d63bea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "e34c56861595487ad76b581c082a1055bc25228f878a924165dd0d7522981dc3"}, "2": {"node_id": "6eb6755e-7277-40ac-b15e-2b7bf039d0d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "03fccd6c06bd7304bd9f4cbcb1f6bae62452d9b0134582c9ceda5ddbf87cca47"}}, "hash": "e2cc36fc44425417e40518d6690e577b25aaea5a0eb883838076dfb00f399789", "text": "7. ICRs Regarding Review of Medical \nNecessity Decisions by a Physician or Other Health Care Professional With Expertise in the Field of Medicine Appropriate to the Requested Service (\u00a7\u00a7 422.566 and 422.629) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 267). \nIn section III.N. of this proposed rule, \nwe have proposed to strengthen the current requirement at \u00a7\u00a7 422.566(d) and 422.629(k)(3) for who must review an organization determination or an integrated organization determination when the MA organization or AIP expects to issue a partially or fully adverse medical necessity decision. \nUnder the existing requirements, if a \nplan expects to issue a partially or fully adverse medical necessity (or any substantively equivalent term used to describe the concept of medical necessity) decision based on the initial review of the request, the organization determination must be reviewed by a physician or other appropriate health care professional with sufficient medical and other expertise, including knowledge of Medicare coverage criteria, before the MA organization issues the organization determination decision. We are proposing that additionally, the reviewing physician or health care professional must have expertise in the field appropriate to the requested service. As discussed in the preamble, this proposal will also apply to coverage denials from section 1876 cost plans and healthcare prepayment plans because \u00a7\u00a7 417.600 and 417.840 require those plans to comply with the requirements in the MA regulations regarding organization determinations. \nWe next discuss the implications of \nthis proposal for staffing and for appeals. We do not believe this proposal will impose additional staffing burden on plans. In light of existing review requirements applicable to organization determinations and integrated organization determinations, coupled with the requirements at \u00a7 422.152 for MA plans (including AIPs) to engage in ongoing quality improvement (including in processing requests for initial or continued authorization of services) and the contract requirement provisions at \u00a7 422.504, we believe plans already have the requisite expertise in staffing to satisfy the proposed requirement.

Under this proposed approach, an appropriate physician or other health care professional with expertise appropriate to the requested service would be reviewing the coverage request at a lower level of review. However, this proposed provision \nwould enhance medical review activities and plan operations related to organization determinations resulting in reduced burden. We note that the existing medical necessity review function is not identified as a separate line item in the aforementioned PRA package (CMS\u2013R\u2013267). However, this function is inherent in, and bundled into, the overall processing of organization determinations and appeals that is accounted for in this package. Because a separate and discrete burden estimate has not previously been submitted to OMB for the medical necessity review function, we are requesting OMB\u2019s review and approval under the aforementioned control number. The following table summarizes relevant plan reported data we have on organization determinations and our estimates related to this proposal to require medical review by physicians or other health care professionals with expertise in the field of medicine appropriate to the requested service. As explained more fully below, if this proposal is finalized we expect savings due to fewer denied organization determinations getting into the appeals process as a result of enhanced medical necessity review by appropriate experts. \nAccording to 2020 MA plan reported \ndata, 1,786,733 (5.7 percent of all 31,346,194 Medicare pre-service organization determination decisions) are unfavorable coverage decisions (the decision is fully or partially unfavorable to the enrollee). Of this universe of unfavorable pre-service organization determinations, 160,806 cases (9 percent * 1,786,733) are appealed and subject to reconsideration by the plan. Of the cases reviewed on appeal, 130,253 cases (81 percent * 160,806 cases) of the reconsiderations resulted in a plan overturning its unfavorable organization determination. \nThus, the total burden is 32,563 hr \n(130,253 cases * 0.25 hr/case) at a cost of $2,481,317 (32,563 hr * $76.20/hr for a business operations specialist). \nAssumptions about the proposal: \nThere is a high percentage of cases overturned on appeal by the plan. We believe that strengthening the regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.566(d) and 422.629(k)(3) to require the physician or other health care professional who reviews the initial coverage decision to have expertise in the field of medicine that is appropriate for the requested service or item ensure the appropriate level of protection for enrollees. For example, if plans are able to approve more coverage requests that involve medical necessity decisions at the organization determination level of review, this is likely to reduce costs associated with the administrative appeal process because fewer denials will occur at the initial level of review and, in turn, fewer cases are likely to get into the appeals process. \nWhile we don\u2019t know with certainty \nwhat the reduction in existing denied organization determinations will be if this proposal is finalized, we believe it is reasonable to estimate that one-half (50 percent) of the existing volume of denials will result in a favorable decision given the enhanced standard of review. In other words, having a physician or other health care professional with expertise in the field of medicine appropriate to the requested service will result in a favorable \norganization determination decision, thereby reducing the number of cases potentially subject to appeal. In the absence of further information, we believe this a reasonable assumption. We solicit stakeholder input on the reasonableness of this assumption and whether their experience suggests some other savings. \nProposed Burden: Therefore, if this \nproposal is implemented, we estimate that 2.85 percent (one-half of the current rate of 5.7 percent), or 893,367 (0.0285 * 31,346,194 pre-service organization determinations) of the organization determinations will be unfavorable. At the previously stated appeal rate of 9 percent of unfavorable pre-service organization determinations being appealed to the plan, the number of cases will be 80,403 (0.09 * 893,367) \nreconsiderations (plan level appeals).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7204bbbe-5948-4d7f-a4e5-178dba098b6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7204bbbe-5948-4d7f-a4e5-178dba098b6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eb7ec9b8-af79-4b1e-9845-fc7cfdcfb6d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d99b422e0c83ed44a64eb6c5380ce1c1090391e6bf9f914e3872c67f708b8a98"}, "2": {"node_id": "14ca07e1-68dd-49ba-8215-3820c88d5974", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "94af79f6a7aa336ddcc313e0c34af1a1db595413e74eeb2f230ab394c4b6b337"}}, "hash": "ca900468369b6559d949395b61dce4275860c15ebaf9e8990e23ad30b81ae34b", "text": "Assuming the overturn rate of 81 percent remains, we expect overturns of 65,126 cases (0.81 * 80,403 cases). \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00228 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.017</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2TABLE 8: EXPECTED IMPACT OF PROPOSAL ON APPEALS \nProposed Under \nItem Current Re!!ulations CMS-4201-P Comments \nNumber of pre-service decisions 31,346,194 31,346,194 No change \nPercent of unfavorable pre-service organization We assume a savings of 50% in unfavorable \ndeterminations 0.057 0.0285 decisions \nNumber of unfavorable pre-service organization Product of previous two rows (-893,366 or roughly \ndeterminations 1,786,733 893,367 50% savings) \nPercent of unfavorable pre-service organization \ndeterminations that are appealed 0.09 0.09 No change \nNumber of unfavorable pre-service organization Product of previous two rows (-80,403 or 50% \ndeterminations that are appealed 160,806 80,403 savings) \nPercent of appeals resulting in an overturn 0.81 0.81 No change \nProduct of previous two rows (-65,127 or roughly \nNumber of appeals resulting in an overturn 130,253 65,126 50% savings) \nTime for a single appeal notifications (hr) 0.25 0.25 No change \nProduct of previous two rows (-16,281 or roughly \nTotal time (hr) 32 563 16 282 50% savings) \nWage of business operations specialist $76.20/hr $76.20/hr No change \nTotal Cost $2,481,301 $1,240,688 Product of previous two rows", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12a23fef-c6bb-4968-ad8f-096761e3ba37": {"__data__": {"id_": "12a23fef-c6bb-4968-ad8f-096761e3ba37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "188c8f05-587e-4293-8747-8a9558c83811", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9d2be00232ed11581b04f23dc14284f3fc133da8bd4859aedcb4081640172453"}, "3": {"node_id": "52e9e00d-fb49-4a87-9224-a160810fff8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "feaed75d35e5202d9a6593fb798b58826199be7dd63f1a0cdabf850dcd49d94d"}}, "hash": "247c3073af94a74030fe3c3047dcd09167a4fb431f6ecf01e213f3d1a67a9537", "text": "79679 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nWe estimate that a physician spends \n30 minutes reviewing a case for medical \nnecessity. Under our proposal the same 30 minutes will be used for review; however, the review will occur at the organization determination level of review rather than at the appeal level of review. Thus, we expect no savings from physician review. \nHowever, savings will occur as a \nresult of a reduction is issuing appeal notices if the plan is able to approve more requests at a lower level of review (resulting in fewer appeals). We estimate that a business operations specialist spends 15 minutes generating and sending the notice of the appeal decision, or 16,282 hours (80,403 cases \u00d7 0.25hr/case) at a cost of $1,240,688 \n(16,282 hr * $76.20/hr). \nSavings: To estimate savings \nassociated with this proposed rulemaking, we note that the proposed rule estimates 50 percent of the burden of the current practice and hence the savings is also 50 percent. That is, the numbers in the column with proposed burden are numerically equal to the savings: 16,282 hours and $1,240,688 ($76.20/hr \u00d7 16,282). \nWe recognize that there are \ncircumstances in which the plan is \nunable to make a fully favorable organization determination based on the information they have available to them before the end of the applicable adjudication timeframe. However, we believe that there remains a proportion of cases that contain the necessary information needed to approve coverage that may have a higher likelihood of approval if the individual reviewing the case has specific expertise related to the item or service being requested. \n8. ICRs Regarding Strengthening \nUpdating Translation Requirements Standards for Required Materials and Content: Require FIDE SNPs and HIDE SNPs and Applicable Integrated Plans to Translate Materials Into the Medicare Translation Standard Plus Additional Medicaid Languages (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 and 423.2267) \nWe are proposing to require that FIDE \nSNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs translate materials into any languages required by the Medicare translation standard plus any additional languages required by the Medicaid translation standard as specified through their Medicaid capitated contracts. \nThis rule proposes to slightly modify \nexisting policy, so the impact to FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs depends upon whether, and to what extent, these plans are already translating materials in ways that would meet our proposed requirements. We note that translation requirements vary by State. Therefore, \nwe expect no impact in States where the applicable Medicaid and Medicaid translation requirements result in the same outcome. We expect marginal impacts where State requirements result in translation into languages not required by the current MA rules at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(2) and 423.2267(a)(2). However, even in these States, FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs (in combination with their affiliated Medicaid managed care plans) have translators on staff or access them via contractors because of existing Medicare and Medicaid translation requirements. \nConsistent with our April 15, 2011 \nfinal rule (76 FR 21536), (CMS\u20134144\u2013F, RIN 0938\u2013AQ00), we continue to claim that the Medicare translation requirement is exempt from the requirements of the PRA since the time, \neffort, and financial resources necessary to comply with the proposed translation requirements is a usual and customary business practice (see 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). For a full accounting of the translation burden, please see section IX.D.3.b. of this proposed rule. \n9. ICRs Regarding Medicare Advantage \n(MA) and Part D Marketing (Subpart V of Parts 422 and 423) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20131051 (CMS\u2013 10260). \nWe are proposing several changes to \nthe marketing policies in subpart V of parts 422 and 423.

The 60-day notice will publish soon after the publication of the final rule (CMS\u20134201\u2013F). \nIn the proposed provision, \u2018\u2018Changes \nto an Approved Formulary\u2019\u2019 (see section III.Q. of this proposed rule) we propose to codify guidance in place since early in the Part D program. The burden associated with the negative change request process and notice of negative formulary changes to CMS, affected enrollees, current and prospective enrollees, and other specified entities (as listed in \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(i)) was not accurately captured under the aforementioned OMB control number, which simply included a lump sum of 40 hours per Part D sponsor for a business operations specialist to complete notice requirements to CMS and other entities and did not include notice to affected enrollees. Similarly, the aforementioned control number does not include burden associated with updating the Part D formulary on the Part D sponsor website as required per \u00a7 423.128(d)(2)(ii)\u2013(iii). We are now quantifying burden associated with negative formulary changes in a more granular fashion, which includes notice \nto affected enrollees and online notice by updating the formulary posted on the Part D sponsor website, which we believe to reflect the operational processes which Part D sponsors have been following. As such, we do not believe this reflects added burden for Part D sponsors but rather quantifies the burden that Part D sponsors have been assuming over the course of the Part D program. As noted in section III.Q.1. of this proposed rule, we believe Part D sponsors have been following published \nguidance since CMS has operational oversight of negative change requests and corresponding formulary updates and we are not aware of significant complaints that beneficiaries are being subjected to negative formulary changes without proper notice. \nImmediate formulary changes require \nadvance general notice that such changes may occur at any time. Advance general notice to CMS of immediate substitutions is currently incorporated into annual bid submission workflow as a simple checkbox, which we do not believe has added substantial burden to the overall bid submission process. Language constituting advance general notice of immediate formulary changes (that is, immediate substitutions, positive formulary changes, and market withdrawals) for other specified entities and current and prospective enrollees, is already incorporated into model formulary and evidence of coverage documents and we do not believe our proposed changes would add a substantial burden to preparing the documents outside of the routine annual updates. The burden attributed to the dissemination of Part D plan information is approved under the aforementioned control number at 80 hours annually for each Part D contract\u2019s business operations specialist to prepare required plan materials consistent with \u00a7 423.128(a), which includes annual updates to the formulary and evidence of coverage documents, among other information. Since language has already been incorporated into the model documents used by Part D sponsors to update their materials and since CMS\u201310141 has been posted for comment multiple times since the requirements related to advance general notice were codified at \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(iv)(C) (which we are proposing to move to \u00a7 423.120(f)(2)), we continue to assume the accuracy of this estimate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05ee2c9b-e228-4d57-bc75-46ed18d058fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "05ee2c9b-e228-4d57-bc75-46ed18d058fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17800925-e44c-429b-9951-e07f25b2c3fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0e4b6b2ab2e7b2fb3e03dbde27beefbf01707849c16496b71b2f789ad64e3e5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c211b74-9a94-47c0-a43e-1d83a2ccc70b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "db0e6b56d805dbdce322a65a4cb21cf5c709afa34ce817ce8639758aee18779b"}}, "hash": "c0ae959099cb43830397b0cf9f308e2030f7876607863ee2b94877dfdb092c8a", "text": "Part D sponsors notify CMS of their \nintent to make a negative formulary change by submitting a negative change request (NCR) via the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) NCR module. Part D sponsors provide CMS notice of changes which do not require NCRs by submitting updated formulary files during monthly windows, which is a standard formulary management operation. Part D sponsors submit formularies which can be used across multiple contracts and plans. In 2021, CMS approved 551 formularies which were used across 946 contracts and \n6,679 plans offered by 206 parent organizations. Since there are some efficiencies with respect to formulary \nmanagement and NCR submissions (for example, NCRs submitted for one formulary can be applied to others in a streamlined manner), we estimate burden at the parent organization level. However, not all Part D sponsors submit NCRs. In 2021, 136 parent organizations submitted 3,642 NCRs for 321 formularies. We believe that generally a pharmacist is responsible for managing NCR submissions and that each NCR takes approximately 5 minutes (0.0833 hr) to submit through the HPMS module, based on CMS internal user testing. In total, for 136 parent organizations, the burden to submit NCRs is estimated to be 303 hours (3,642 NCRs \u00d7 0.0833 hr per NCR) at a \ncost of $36,621 ($120.86/hr \u00d7 303 hr). \nPart D sponsors include immediate \nformulary changes, approved negative changes, and any enhancements (for example, addition of newly approved drugs, moving a drug to a lower cost- sharing tier, removing or making less restrictive utilization management requirements) to their formularies consistent with formulary requirements. Generally, every formulary is updated during these monthly formulary update windows and CMS reviews all changes to ensure they are consistent with regulatory requirements. Since every parent organization generally updates their formulary regardless of whether any negative changes are made, we estimate burden for all 206 parent organizations representing 551 formularies in 2021. There are 11 formulary update windows per year (monthly from January to November). We believe a pharmacist is generally responsible for managing formulary submissions. In this case, 6,061 formulary submissions (551 formularies \u00d7 11 submission windows). We estimate \nthat each formulary file update requires 2 hours to prepare, for a total of 12,122 hours (6,061 submissions \u00d7 2 hr per \nsubmission) at a cost of $1,465,065 (12,122 hr \u00d7 $120.86/hr). \nIn addition to notifying CMS in the \nmanner described, Part D sponsors are required to notify other specified entities of formulary changes. As defined in \u00a7 423.100, \u2018\u2018other specified entities\u2019\u2019 are State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (as defined in \u00a7 423.454), entities providing other prescription drug coverage (as described in \u00a7 423.464(f)(1)), authorized prescribers, network pharmacies, and pharmacists.

To estimate burden associated with providing notice of formulary changes to other specified entities, we calculate the time and cost associated with updating the formulary and providing notice of drugs affected by negative formulary changes (such as a summary table which lists such changes) on the Part D sponsor\u2019s website. For 551 formularies in 2021, monthly updates would be posted at least 12 times annually for a total of 6,612 postings (551 formularies \u00d7 12 \nupdates/year) by all 206 parent organizations. We estimate that it would take 1 hour to update the website consistent with the requirements at \u00a7 423.128(d)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that a computer programmer would be responsible for such postings for a total annual burden of 6,612 hours (6,612 updates \u00d7 1 hr/update) at a cost of \n$614,387 ($92.92/hr \u00d7 6,612 hr). \nEnrollees affected by negative \nformulary changes are currently required to receive direct written notice as described at \u00a7 423.120(b)(5)(i)(A) and (b)(5)(ii). We propose to move this requirement to \u00a7 423.120(f) and (f)(4), respectively. CMS provides a model \u2018\u2018Notice of Formulary Change\u2019\u2019 which sponsors may use to meet regulatory requirements. Affected enrollees include those who are subject to immediate substitutions and maintenance formulary changes. The notice requirement is the same, with the exception that enrollees subject to immediate substitutions receive notice retrospectively while enrollees subject to maintenance formulary changes receive notice in advance of the change. Under the proposed rule codifying current operational guidance, there \nwould be no affected enrollees subject to non-maintenance changes since these \ntypes of changes would be permitted only when enrollees taking the drug subject to the non-maintenance change are exempt from the change (that is, \u2018\u2018grandfathered\u2019\u2019) for the remainder of the contract year. CMS does not collect data on the number of enrollees affected by negative formulary changes. In order \nto estimate the number of affected enrollees, we used 2021 data on the total number of Part D enrollees (across the entire program) taking each drug subject to the negative formulary change during the contract year. We then calculated the estimated number of affected enrollees by prorating the number of enrollees taking the drug across the entire program based on the relative proportion of the Part D plan\u2019s enrollment to the total Medicare Part D enrollment. \nThe following example illustrates this \nprocess. As of December 2021, there were 49,289,670 Part D enrollees. As stated previously, multiple contracts and plans may share the same formulary. A negative formulary change submitted for Drug A on a particular formulary impacted a total of 6 individual plans utilizing this formulary. The total number of Part D enrollees taking Drug A in 2021 was 25,717. The total number of enrollees in the 6 plans implementing the negative formulary change was 40,045, representing 0.0812 percent of the total Part D enrollment (40,045/49,289,670). We then assume that of the 25,717 Part D enrollees taking Drug A during 2021, that 0.0812 percent or 21 enrollees (25,717 \u00d7 0.000812) were affected by the \nnegative formulary change. This logic was applied across all immediate substitutions and maintenance formulary changes submitted during 2021. We do not estimate enrollees affected by market withdrawals since these occur infrequently and unpredictably (historically occurring every few years) and the number of enrollees affected could vary substantially depending on the drug implicated. In total, there were 164 parent \norganizations that implemented immediate substitutions or maintenance formulary changes for 379 formularies used for 576 contracts and 3,735 plans affecting a total of 65,535 enrollees.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c3ea010-f363-44bc-9d3a-d31d2bf025d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c3ea010-f363-44bc-9d3a-d31d2bf025d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57b04971-365e-4141-9b15-dd55820b2810", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "360ba76ff11652a0e949946bbfe168298ba3cd703479ce77ac010aa90cec46d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e737341-c69b-4a4d-a026-f69c988a47b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "bdee1f55f6db6e8f2486ec95c2979cc30f419b895c9a3b641154d800f02f5fb2"}}, "hash": "a2b721b8cb7060e86b246b7c3855505d8506f57e9343b1eb4d93f340f0bc87f5", "text": "We do not attribute substantial burden associated with incorporating the model notice into Part D sponsors\u2019 internal systems for mailing, since this would have been a one-time initial upload with minor updates annually.

ICRs Regarding Part D Medication \nTherapy Management (MTM) Program Eligibility Criteria (\u00a7 423.153(d)) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20131154 (CMS\u2013 10396). \nBased on analyses conducted on \nMTM plan-reported and validated beneficiary-level data from 2020, CMS proposes the following combination of changes to the MTM program targeting criteria: \n\u2022Requiring plan sponsors to target all \ncore chronic diseases, and continuing to allow them to add other chronic diseases; \n\u2022Codifying the current 9 core chronic \ndiseases in regulation and adding HIV/ AIDS, for a total of 10 core chronic diseases; \n\u2022Lowering the maximum number of \ncovered Part D drugs, a sponsor may require from 8 to 5 drugs and requiring sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs in their targeting criteria; and \n\u2022Revising the annual cost threshold \n($4,935 in 2023) methodology to be based on the average annual cost of 5 generic drugs ($1,004 in 2020); \nTaken together, we estimate that these \nproposed changes would increase the number (and percentage) of Part D beneficiaries eligible for MTM services by 6,485,066 from 4,508,762 (9 percent of all Part D beneficiaries) to 10,993,828 (22.93 percent of all Part D beneficiaries). While we considered multiple alternative proposals, we ultimately proposed this combination of changes as a way to close significant gaps in MTM eligibility while balancing program size and burden on Part D sponsors. \nUnder \u00a7 423.153(d), all MTM \nenrollees must be offered a CMR at least annually and Targeted Medication Reviews (TMRs) no less than quarterly. A CMR is an interactive, person-to- person, or telehealth consultation performed by a pharmacist or other qualified provider that includes a review of the individual\u2019s medications and may result in the creation of a recommended medication action plan. An individualized, written summary in CMS\u2019s Standardized Format must be provided following each CMR. Under \u00a7 423.153(d)(1), plans are required to provide all enrollees targeted for MTM services with information about safe disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances. Plans may mail this information as part of the CMR summary, a TMR, or other MTM correspondence or service. In this section we are estimating the additional \nburden that would be placed on plan sponsors to conduct CMRs (labor cost) and mail the written CMR summaries (non-labor cost) to the additional beneficiaries that would be targeted for MTM programs based on our proposed revisions. We also estimate the cost of sending safe disposal information to the beneficiaries who would be newly targeted under these revised criteria, but do not receive a CMR. \nTo obtain aggregate burden we \nseparately estimate: (1) the burden for pharmacists to complete the CMR; (2) the mailing costs of the CMRs; and (3) the cost of mailing of safe disposal instructions to those targeted beneficiaries who did not accept the offer of a CMR. \n\u2022The burden for pharmacists to \ncomplete the CMR: Based on internal data, we found 63.6 percent of MTM program enrollees accepted the offer of a CMR in 2020. To estimate the cost of conducting the additional CMRs, we multiply the expected number of additional MTM program enrollees (6,485,066) by 0.636 to obtain the number of additional CMRs we estimate will actually be conducted (4,124,502). We estimate a pharmacist would take 40 minutes (0.6667 hr) at $120.86/hr to complete a CMR. Thus, the total burden is 2,749,805 hours (0.6667 hr/CMR * 4,124,502 enrollees who accept the CMR offer) at a cost of $332,341,432 (2,749,805 hr * $120.86/hr). \n\u2022Mailing Costs of CMRs. To estimate \nthe cost of sending the CMR summaries, we assume that the average length of a CMR is 7 pages (including 1 page for information regarding safe disposal). Therefore, the first class postage costs $0.81 per metered mailing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b39e63e7-86ac-4885-b683-a973ff16d38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b39e63e7-86ac-4885-b683-a973ff16d38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a6770f4-10a9-45ca-9157-0e2b382a4696", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "d97495d0de027f6c6cb2d11f1bd038fa50c93381e02bb38db8dbabcc1a145848"}, "2": {"node_id": "79ca120a-6da4-4c88-b933-74836ce15c71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a74bae2d34862dd17c10aa07b7c2e80c577447f34888b89bb497cf5053d44d1e"}}, "hash": "a4faecaed52b4edb18765ed2dc8aea43d96f9871991bf5af93bb8fc307bf687e", "text": "Therefore, the first class postage costs $0.81 per metered mailing. Paper costs are $0.007 per sheet ($3.50 per ream/500 sheets per ream) and toner costs $70.00 per cartridge and lasts for 10,000 sheets (at $0.007 per sheet = $70.00/10,000 sheets). Thus, the total cost per CMR mailing is $0.908 ($0.81 postage + [7 sheets/CMR * $0.014]. Therefore, the \nannual cost of mailing CMRs to the additional 4,124,502 beneficiaries expected to accept the CMR offer is $3,745,048 (4,124,502 enrollees \u00d7 $0.908/mailing). \n\u2022Mailing costs for safe disposal \ninformation: Out of the 6,485,066 \nadditional beneficiaries expected to be targeted for MTM based on the revised criteria, we expect that 36.4 percent or 2,360,564 (6,485,066 * 0.364) will decline a CMR. These enrollees will still need to receive information regarding the safe disposal of prescription drugs that are controlled substances. For purposes of calculating the burden, we are assuming that any safe disposal information that is not included in a \nCMR is either (1) being mailed in a TMR, which may be as short as one page and may contain private health information; or (2) is mailed as a stand- alone document which does not contain any private health information. For purposes of impact, (1) if one additional page is included in the TMR, then there is no additional postage; and (2) if the safe disposal information is mailed separately, there would be no private health information, and the burden would be the cost of one page plus bulk postage. Due to a lack of data with regard to what percentage of safe disposal information will be mailed as part of a TMR or other MTM correspondence or service, we are assuming that all safe disposal information not sent with a CMR will be one page that is mailed separately using bulk postage in order to project the maximum cost of such mailing. The cost to mail one page of safe disposal information is $0.015 per enrollee if the letter does not contain private health information and thus bulk mailing is used (1 page $0.007/sheet) + (1 page \u00d7 $0.007 toner) + ($0.20/200 items for bulk postage). Therefore, we estimate that the cost of mailing safe disposal information to those beneficiaries targeted for MTM who do not receive it in a CMR summary is $35,408 ($0.015 \u00d7 2,360,564). \nTherefore, the total burden associated \nwith the proposed revisions to the MTM targeting criteria is 2,749,805 hours and $336,121,888 ($332,341,432 for a pharmacist to produce the CMRs for beneficiaries newly targeted for MTM under the proposed revised criteria + $3,745,048 to mail the CMR written summary in the CMS standardized format with safe disposal information + $35,408 for mailing information regarding safe disposal to beneficiaries newly targeted for MTM who do not receive a CMR). \n12.

Although we cannot predict if there will be any change in the number of overpayments identified or reported under the proposed amendments to the rule, we solicit comment on this assumption. \n13. ICRs Regarding Required Notices for \nInvoluntary Disenrollment for Loss of Special Needs Status (\u00a7 422.74) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 267). \nMA organizations that offer special \nneeds plans are currently effectuating involuntary disenrollments for loss of special needs status as part of existing disenrollment processes, including the member notifications outlined in our proposal; therefore, no additional burden is anticipated from this proposal. However, because a burden estimate for these member notifications has not previously been submitted to \nOMB, due to inadvertent oversight, we are seeking OMB approval under the aforementioned OMB control number. \nWe are proposing to codify current \npolicy on MA plan notices prior to a member disenrollment for loss of special needs status. MA organizations would be required to provide the member a minimum of 30 days advance notice of disenrollment regardless of the date of the loss of special needs status. Additionally, the organization would be required to provide the member a final notice of involuntary disenrollment, sent within 3 business days following the disenrollment effective date, and before the disenrollment transaction is submitted to CMS. \nWhere an individual is involuntarily \ndisenrolled from an MA plan for any reason other than death, loss of entitlement to Part A or Part B, the MA organization must give the individual a written notice of the disenrollment with an explanation of why the MA organization is planning to disenroll the individual, pursuant to \u00a7 422.74(c). The notice requirement in \u00a7 422.74(c) is currently approved by OMB under the aforementioned control number. \nTo estimate the number of notices \nrequired due to involuntary disenrollments for loss of special needs status, we determined the average number of annual disenrollments due to loss of special needs status. Between 2017 and 2021, there were an average of \n55,127 involuntary disenrollments per year due to loss of special needs status. \nWe estimate that it would take each \nMA organization 1 minute (0.017 hr) to assemble and disseminate the advance notice, 5 minutes (0.083 hr) to submit the required transaction to CMS for each disenrollment, and 0.017 hr to assemble and disseminate the final notice for each disenrollment. Therefore, the total annual time for each MA organization is 0.1170 hours (0.017 hr + 0.083 hr + 0.017 hr). \nWe estimate the aggregate annual \nburden for all MA organizations to process these disenrollments to be 6,450 hours (55,127 disenrollments * 0.117 hr) at a cost of $491,490 (6,450 hr * $76.20/ hr). \n14. ICRs Regarding Involuntary \nDisenrollment for Individuals Enrolled in an MA Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plan (\u00a7 422.74(b)(2)) \nThe requirement proposed at \n\u00a7 422.74(b)(2)(vii) to establish a process for involuntary disenrollment for an individual who loses eligibility mid- year to be enrolled in an MA MSA plan, and more specifically, the requirement for the MA organization to give the individual a written notice of the disenrollment at \u00a7 422.74(c) with an \nexplanation of why the MA organization is planning to disenroll the individual, will be submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130753 (CMS\u2013R\u2013267). \nThe annual burden associated with \nthis requirement consists of the time and cost to notify the individual and CMS. Based on the active burden in CMS\u2013R\u2013267, we estimate that each disenrollment will require 1 minute (0.017 hr) for the MA MSA plan to notify CMS and 5 minutes (0.083 hr) for the MA MSA plan to notify the individual.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c900ad22-5baf-43d4-ba8d-aa4a12b152af": {"__data__": {"id_": "c900ad22-5baf-43d4-ba8d-aa4a12b152af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a8bc754-82b3-4356-88df-262aec09b4b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "4560f7c3ac67041475bfd7651220df348673ff9bb3607443c9caedbc3254af94"}, "2": {"node_id": "f44750b1-b72a-4d92-b07e-6eb89022cbe3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fd6bf0002ecd12e75946d8fb884d61849f766546f0f3af888875b35c8a3f85c6"}}, "hash": "9f0936d4a0c6b0fc90c067942c174b5394c104f32bc319a3e2bcdd5af90605c2", "text": "Thus, the total burden per disenrollment is estimated at 6 minutes (0.1 hr) (1 minute to assemble and disseminate the notice to CMS and 5 minutes to assemble and disseminate the notice to the individual) at a cost of $7.62 (0.1 hr \u00d7 $76.20/hr for a business \noperations specialist to perform the work). \nTo obtain aggregate burden we used \ndata from 2019 and 2021 in which there were an average of 4 MSA contracts. We used an average since the data had no visible trend but hovered around a central value. There was an average of 8,624 enrollees during 2019\u20132021 and the average disenrollment was 124. Thus, we estimate an aggregate burden of 12 hours (124 disenrollments * 0.1 hr. per disenrollment) at a cost of $914 (12 hr * $76.20/hr). 15. ICRs Regarding Required Notice for Reinstatements Based on Beneficiary Cancellation of New Enrollment (\u00a7\u00a7 422.60 and 423.32) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20131378 (CMS\u2013 10718). \nCMS\u2019s subregulatory guidance \ncurrently provides that MA and PDP plans send notification of enrollment reinstatement based on the cancellation of enrollment in a new plan. Our proposal would not add to existing reinstatement processes; therefore, no additional burden is anticipated from this proposal. However, because a burden estimate for these enrollment reinstatement notifications has not previously been submitted to OMB, we aim to correct that oversight by requesting OMB\u2019s review and approval under the aforementioned control number. \nWe are proposing to codify CMS\u2019s \ncurrent policy that plans notify an individual when the individual\u2019s enrollment is reinstated due to the individual\u2019s cancellation of enrollment in a different plan. The MA or PDP plan from which the individual was disenrolled would be required to send the notification of the enrollment reinstatement within 10 days of receipt of Daily Transaction Reply Report (DTRR) confirmation of the individual\u2019s reinstatement. The reinstatement notice would include confirmation of the individual\u2019s enrollment in the previous plan with no break in coverage, plan- specific information as needed, and plan contact information. \nTo estimate the number of \nreinstatement notices required due to an individual\u2019s cancellation of enrollment in a new plan, we determined the number of annual reinstatements based on the cancellations of enrollment in a new plan. In 2021, there were 5,686,989 disenrollments from MA and MA\u2013PD plans due to enrollments in another plan and 4,292,426 disenrollments from PDP plans due to enrollments in another plan. Further, between 2017 and 2021, there was an average of 193,183 cancelled enrollments per year in a new MA plan (including MA\u2013PD plans).

ICRs Regarding Medicare Final \nSettlement Process and Final Settlement Appeals Process for Organizations and Sponsors That Are Consolidating, Non- Renewing, or Otherwise Terminating a Contract (\u00a7\u00a7 422.500, 422.528, 422.529, 423.501, 423.521, and 423.522) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20131054 (CMS\u2013 10261). \nIn this rule, proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.528, \n422.529, 423.521, and 423.522 would increase burden by requiring that MA organizations and Part D sponsors who disagree with the CMS calculated final settlement amount appeal the final settlement amount, if any, for each contract that consolidates, non-renews, or terminates. There is also additional burden requiring that MA organizations and Part D sponsors respond directly to CMS. The response consists of those MA organizations and Part D sponsors requesting an appeal of the final settlement amount and filing a written request for reconsideration with CMS that includes the specific calculations with which the MA organization or Part D sponsor disagrees and any relevant evidence to support a belief that the CMS final settlement amount may have been calculated incorrectly. \nIn amended paragraphs \u00a7\u00a7 422.500 \nand 423.501 of this proposed rule, we proposed to define final settlement amount and outline the proposed final settlement process which consists of: (1) CMS calculating the final settlement amount of any payment to be disbursed to, or collected from, an MA organization or Part D sponsor whose contract with CMS has been consolidated into another contract, non- renewed, or terminated; (2) CMS communicating to the MA organization or Part D sponsor the final settlement \namount and any relevant information MA organizations and Part D sponsors need to validate the final settlement amount; and (3) final actions needed to be taken by CMS, MA organizations, and Part D sponsors to make payments to or receive final payments from CMS. The final settlement amount is calculated by summing final retroactive payment adjustments that accumulated after a contract ceased operation and all final applicable reconciliations including MLR remittances (described in \u00a7\u00a7 422.2470 and 423.2470), Coverage Gap Discount Program (described in \u00a7 423.2320), Part D annual reconciliation (described in \u00a7 423.343), and final risk adjustment reconciliation (described in \u00a7 422.310). \nUnder the current policy, CMS would \nsend a notice, referred to as the notice of final settlement, to MA organizations and Part D sponsors with contracts that are consolidating, non-renewing, or terminating containing information on final settlement. The notice of final settlement contains (1) the final settlement amount; (2) relevant CMS banking and financial mailing information; (3) relevant CMS contact information and; (4) information for MA organizations and Part D sponsors regarding the steps for requesting a review of the final settlement amount calculation. \nHistorically, on average, for the period \n2015 through 2020, CMS sent 47 letters annually and received 3 responses, which typically requested that CMS validate the final settlement amount. \nWe are proposing at new paragraphs \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.528(b) (for MA) and 423.521(b) (for Part D) to require MA organizations and Part D sponsors that disagree with the final settlement amount request an appeal of the final settlement amount within 15 days of the date of issuance of the notice of final settlement. \nWhereas under current CMS \nprocesses, we allow MA organizations and Part D sponsors to submit evidence supporting a review request on a case- by-case basis, proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.529 and 422.522 specify that MA organizations and Part D sponsors specify the calculations with which they disagree and provide evidence supporting the assertion that CMS\u2019s calculation of the final settlement amount described in the notice of final settlement is incorrect. \nIn calculating the burden of this \nproposal, we assume the following: \n\u202244 contracts, on average, will accept \nthe CMS final settlement amount upon issuance of the notice of final settlement. \n\u20223 contracts will disagree with the \nCMS decision and request a review of the final settlement amount calculation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa7e2da8-ce7d-449f-af8a-80285ec54294": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa7e2da8-ce7d-449f-af8a-80285ec54294", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "049921bb-fb9c-4724-8023-21875d6e7cd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "54c8ab818d12d7f3b0ce186e0870b50560825b449acbe4159e15987e25591b4a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1b31320-b3ce-4b28-acbf-7d299068c8de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9224bf7e6571efc217d05014a650a6a33badd0241d495e20c910014986ee1f32"}}, "hash": "0ad5c3774f851eeea45f38f1f33215125a294335b93b9762e8b050ff86e93d55", "text": "\u2022Burden is distributed between \nbusiness operations specialists working \nat $76.20/hr and Medical and Health managers working at $115.21/hr, who perform a quality review of data and draft a response to CMS on behalf those MA organizations or Part D sponsors who disagree with the CMS calculated final settlement amount. \n\u2022The primary tasks of business \noperations specialists are to gather and validate data, determine the accuracy of the final settlement amount calculation, and draft a response. \n\u2022The primary task of the managers is \nto quality assure the work of the business operations specialist. \nThe time for MA organizations and \nPart D sponsors is based on the effort needed to access and analyze data in order to validate the CMS final settlement amount and provide aa request for a reconsideration. Any other burden was not considered in this analysis. For example, under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 422.529 and 423.522, we explain that CMS will not accept, as part of the final settlement process or review, any new information that would be used for adjusting the applicable reconciliations \nand that the final settlement amount determined after a CMS review is final. Should a Part D sponsor request a review of the final settlement amount because of a belief that the Part D annual reconciliation was calculated inaccurately, that review would be denied because CMS will not be redetermining reconciliation amounts, and any burden associated with that request was not included in this analysis. \nIn estimating time, we separately \nconsider the 44 contracts that we expect to agree with the CMS decision and the 3 contracts that we expect to request a review. Besides calculating total costs by considering each case, we also calculate a single summary line for the summary table, by dividing total burden by the 47 contracts Table 10 summarizes all burden estimates which could be useful in reviewing the bullets that follows this table.

For the development of the risk assessment tool, we estimate it would take each PACE organization 5 hours consisting of: 4 hours of work by the compliance officer at $72.90/hr and 1 hour of work by the \nPCP at $232.88/hr. The weighted hourly wage for the compliance officer and PCP to update policies and procedures to create a risk assessment is $104.90/hr (((4 hr * $72.90/hr) + (1 hr * $232.88/ hr))/5 hr of aggregate burden). \nIn aggregate, we estimate a one-time \nburden of 149 hours (149 PACE organizations\n225* 1 hr) at a cost of \n$10,862 (149 hrs * $72.90/hr) for the development of policies and procedures. \nTo develop a risk assessment tool, we \nalso estimate a one-time burden of 745 hours (149 PACE organizations * 5 hrs) at a cost of $78,151 (745 hrs * $104.90/ hr) for both the compliance officer and PCP roles in developing the risk assessment tool. \n19.

This includes the minimum requirements for the provision of services PACE organizations must provide and how the services must be furnished. The current requirement that PACE organizations must provide all necessary services to meet the needs of participants as expeditiously as the participant\u2019s health conditions require would not change with this proposed rule, but as discussed in section VI.G. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to add required timeframes for arranging and scheduling services for PACE participants. We believe there will be a one-time burden for PACE organizations to update their policies and procedures to reflect the proposed timeframes. We believe the compliance officer will be responsible for updating the policies and procedures. We estimate that it would take the compliance officer 1 hour at $72.90/hr to update the necessary materials. Therefore, we estimate a one-time burden of 149 hours (149 PACE organizations * 1 hr) at a cost \nof $10,862 (149 hrs * $72.90/hr). \n20.

As discussed in section VI.J. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to add new participant rights and modify existing participant rights to enhance participant protections. Specifically, we are proposing to add and/or modify the rights to appropriate and timely treatment; to be fully informed, in writing, of different treatment options including palliative, comfort, and end- of-life care; to fully understand the PACE organization\u2019s palliative, comfort, and end-of-life care services; and to request services from the PACE organization through the process described in \u00a7 460.121. PACE organizations are currently required to provide a copy of the participant rights listed in \u00a7 460.112 to participants at the time of enrollment, and to post a copy of the rights in the PACE center.

We believe the development of these materials is a one- time burden and would take a compliance officer 2 hours to complete at $72.90/hr. \nIn aggregate, we estimate a one-time \nburden of 596 hours (149 PACE organizations * (2 hrs + 2 hrs)) at a cost of $43,448 (596 hrs * $72.90/hr). \nWe also estimate this provision would \nresult in increased ongoing costs to PACE organizations. As discussed in section VI.J. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to require PACE organizations to provide participants with written documentation explaining the different treatment options including palliative, comfort, and end- \nof-life care services. Specifically, we are proposing to require PACE organizations to describe their palliative care, comfort care, and end-of-life care \nservices and how they differ from the care the participant is currently receiving; whether these treatment options will be provided in addition to or in lieu of the care the participant is currently receiving; a detailed description of all services that will be impacted and how they will be impacted if the participant and/or designated representative elects to initiate a different treatment option; and that the participant has the right to revoke or withdraw their consent to receive these treatment options at any time and for any reason. \nWe estimate that a registered nurse \n(RN) will need to tailor written templates for each participant based on the treatment option they choose and the impact that treatment option will have on their current services. We estimate it would take the RN 1 hour to tailor the written template to each participant at $79.56/hr. We also estimate the Master\u2019s-level Social Worker (MSW) would either provide the materials in person to the participant and/or their designated representative or they would mail the materials to the participant. We estimate it would take the MSW 10 minutes (0.1667 hr) to mail or present the materials to each participant at $59.92/hr. \nWe are also proposing that PACE \norganizations must explain the treatment options to participants and/or their designated representatives before palliative care, comfort care, or end-of- life care services can be initiated. This includes fully explaining the treatment options, providing the participant and/ or designated representative with the written materials discussed previously, and obtaining written consent from the participant and/or designated representative. We estimate it would take the MSW 1 hour at $59.92/hr to explain the services and answer any questions the participant and/or designated representative might have. \nTo estimate the increased burden, we \nuse the following assumptions about the number of participants who may pursue palliative care, comfort care, and/or end-of-life care services, based on our experience monitoring and auditing PACE organizations. We estimate that 2 out of every 10 participants in a given year (20 percent) will require written materials for palliative care, comfort care, or end-of-life care services.

September 2022 was 54,637226with 149 \nactive PACE organizations. \nFor tailoring information within the \nwritten templates and providing written \nmaterials to participants as specified at proposed \u00a7 460.112(c)(5), we estimate ongoing burden using the weighted hourly wage for the RN and MSW. The weighted average can be obtained as follows. The total cost per participant is $89.55/hr [(1 hr * $79.56/hr (RN)) + (0.1667 hr * $59.92/hr (MSW))]. The total time is 1.1667 hours (1 hr for the RN plus 0.1667 hr the MSW). Thus, the average hourly wage is $76.75/hr (total cost of $89.55/1.1667 hr). \nUsing these assumptions, we estimate \nthe ongoing burden for proposed requirements at \u00a7 460.112(c)(5) would affect 10,927 participants (20 percent of participants who are expected to need end-of-life explanations * 54,637 participants). Therefore, to tailor and mail materials there is an annual burden of 12,749 hours (10,927 affected participants * 1.1667 hr) at a cost of $978,486 (12,749 hr * $76.75/hr). \nWe estimate an ongoing burden for \nPACE organizations\u2019 MSW to explain treatment options to participants as specified at \u00a7 460.112(e)(2) to be 10,927 hours ((54,637 participants * 20 percent participants who require materials) * 1 hr) at a cost of $ 654,746 (10,927 hr to discuss treatment options * $59.92/hr). \nIn aggregate, we estimate a one-time \nburden of 596 hours (149 PACE organizations * (2 hrs + 2 hrs)) at a cost of $43,448 (596 hr * $72.90/hr) and an annual ongoing burden of 23,676 hours (12,749 hrs + 10,927 hrs) at a cost of $1,633,232 ($978,486 + $654,746). \n21. ICRs Regarding PACE Grievance \nProcess (\u00a7 460.120) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130790 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 244). \nSection 460.120 currently includes \nthe grievance process PACE organizations are required to follow. As discussed in section VI.K. of this proposed rule, PACE organizations are already required to develop procedures on processing grievances, and provide notification of the grievance process to participants upon enrollment and at least annually; however, our proposed changes would require the PACE organization to update those procedures. Additionally, we are proposing that written or oral notification must include such as a summary of the issues, a summary of the findings, the steps taken to investigate the grievance (if applicable), \nand the corrective actions taken (if applicable). Our proposal, which adds requirements on what must be included in grievance resolution notifications, would require the PACE organization to revise and update their notification templates. Therefore, we estimate a one- time burden for PACE organizations to update their materials to meet these new requirements. We do not believe the proposed changes to \u00a7 460.120 will impact the annual hours of burden for PACE organizations, because they are already required provide notification of grievance resolutions to participants, and may opt to do so orally or in writing. Therefore, we believe that the ongoing burden will not change with this proposal. \nFor the one-time burden for updating \npolicies and procedures, we estimate that it would take the compliance officer 2 hours to update these materials at $72.90/hr. For the revised notification of the grievance process, that is provided both upon enrollment and at least annually, we estimate it would take the compliance officer 1 hour to revise these notifications at $72.90/hr. For the written grievance resolution notification, we estimate it will take the compliance officer 1 hour to revise the written resolution notification at $72.90/hr. \nIn aggregate, we estimate it would \ntake PACE organizations 596 hours [149 PACE organizations * (2 hrs + 1 hr + 1 hr)] at a cost of $43,448 (596 hrs * \n$72.90/hr). \n22.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a7683ff-8634-452b-90e0-ec2af4b6dee6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a7683ff-8634-452b-90e0-ec2af4b6dee6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af7dc29e-2c55-41ea-b64f-04c3e026f660", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0330ea3b1cf9b7a81180cc9e2bc0ec54340096fdfd2971251555206a4df089d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "e13b451b-49bb-4b67-a48a-f0217ef6a294", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2e3f950c079320ac1a1c0c9baab036f0502e6394bc8074ce953ca4ca48151ee2"}}, "hash": "a2736ae11aa492c0ca89fd665b66328e0f2944a7a73d2e9f6226a29b3159b7d0", "text": "22. ICRs Regarding the PACE Service \nDetermination Process (\u00a7 460.121) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130790 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 244). \nSection 460.121 currently includes \nthe service determination process PACE organizations are required to follow and only allows PACE organizations to notify participants and/or their representatives of service determination extensions in writing. Per the burden estimate that is currently seeking OMB approval under the process (August 5, 2022; 87 FR 48030), we estimate the burden of the current extension notification requirements at \u00a7 460.121 to be 2,350 hours and $140,812 in aggregate. As discussed in section VI.L. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to allow PACE organizations to notify the participant or their designated representative either orally or in writing when the PACE organization extends the timeframe for making a service determination. Under this proposal, we expect that PACE organizations will prefer to provide oral notification more \nfrequently than written notification, because oral notification is less time consuming. In anticipation of PACE organizations\u2019 preference for oral notification over written notification and the 45 minutes per response reduction in burden oral notification offers, we estimate that the proposed changes will reduce the burden of the extension notification requirements at \u00a7 460.121. \nTo estimate the decreased burden, we \nconsidered: (1) the annual number of \nextension notifications; (2) the estimated proportions of extension notifications that are provided orally or in writing; and (3) the estimated time required to complete oral and written notification. \nFirst, we reviewed extended service \ndetermination requests (SDRs) from 2019 through 2021 and found that there were 6,564 total extended SDRs nationally (3,942 in 2019 + 773 in 2020 + 1,849 in 2021). Then we averaged the number of extended SDRs from 2019\u2013 2021 to calculate 2,188 extended SDRs annually (6,564 total extended SDRs/3 years), which is about 15 extended SDRs per PACE organization annually (2,188 extended SDRs annually/149 PACE organizations). \nSecondly, we estimate, based on our \nexperience with audits of similar areas of PACE requirements where PACE organizations have an option of oral or written notification, that 80 percent of extension notifications will be provided orally, at 15 minutes per notification, and 20 percent will be provided in writing at 1 hour per notification. The hourly wage for notification by an MSW in both cases is $59.92/hr. In aggregate, the new burden would be 875 hours ((2,188 extension notifications * 0.2 written notifications * 1 hr) + (2,188 extension notifications * 0.8 oral notifications * 0.25 hr)) at a cost of $52,430 (875 hrs * $59.92/hr). \nThus, the aggregate annual time and \ncost savings for the proposed changes are minus 1,475 hours (2,350 hr under current provisions minus 875 hr as documented in the pending OMB package) and minus $88,382 ($140,812 cost under current provisions minus $52,430 under the pending OMB package). Additionally, at the individual service determination request extension level, PACE organizations that choose to provide oral notification instead of written notification will save minus 0.75 hours and $44.94 per extension notification. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00238 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e4fc121-6b24-47fb-892d-ba44ca02e65f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e4fc121-6b24-47fb-892d-ba44ca02e65f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42e2dfb9-cd1d-4b52-ba8a-d1947d84fd56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9811162862fb5c42e77a2ce6017051a9086eba9eafd84becfd0f653b6dcd4d6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "5adbeae3-dbb4-4c6f-b310-aa3daea4713c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "6c07b83610ba4a90914ca191ba4dae97cad85d679e555fa67c47c17de12d0b4b"}}, "hash": "2df27f4baade4d36b290b0b3f09c851661ef82c6a89f2fcd623eec81eed50b18", "text": "79689 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n23. ICRs Regarding PACE Participant \nNotification Requirement for PACE Organizations With Past Performance Issues or Compliance Deficiencies (\u00a7 460.198) \nThe following proposed changes will \nbe submitted to OMB for review under control number 0938\u20130790 (CMS\u2013R\u2013 244). \nIn this proposed rule, CMS proposes \nto add a new provision, \u00a7 460.198, which would give CMS the authority to, at its discretion, require a PACE organization to disclose to its PACE participants or potential PACE participants, the PACE organization\u2019s performance and contract compliance deficiencies in a manner specified by CMS. The purpose of this proposal is to enable CMS to better protect PACE participants by ensuring that PACE participants and their caregivers have adequate information to make informed decisions regarding the PACE organization. \nThe overall PACE organization \nburden of this requirement is expected to be minimal. In the past, CMS has only required organizations to send these notices to enrollees when CMS sanctioned the organization, which is an extremely rare occurrence. Regarding PACE organizations, between CY 2019 and 2021, CMS sanctioned a total of 3 PACE organizations for an average of 1 per year. As a result, CMS projects that between one and two PACE organizations per year would be required to notify participants and potential participants of their performance and contract compliance deficiencies. In addition, CMS would provide the PACE organization with a template of what to include in the notice, and organizations have the capability to send notices to participants. Therefore, we estimate a burden for PACE Organizations to complete and send the template to participants and potential participants. \nFor the annual burden for completing \nthe template and sending it to participants and potential participants, we estimate that it would take the compliance officer at the PACE organization 1 hour to complete and send out the template (which would be automated) at $72.90 per hour. In aggregate, we estimate it would take \nPACE organizations 2 hours (2 PACE organizations * (1 hr) at a cost of $146 (2 hrs * $72.90/hr). \n24. ICRs Regarding Safeguarding Data \nand Records and Medical Record Requirements (\u00a7\u00a7 460.200 and 460.210) \nPACE organizations are currently \nrequired to retain original communications related to a participant\u2019s care, health, or safety in the medical record. In this proposal, we are removing the requirement that these communications be stored in the participant\u2019s medical record, provided certain conditions are met. Therefore, our burden estimates include costs incurred related to staff (1) training; (2) software development; (3) file cabinets for document storage; and (4) updating/ maintaining the organizations\u2019 policies and procedures. \n\u2022Training: We estimate that a PACE \norganization will spend 40 hours at a \ncost of $2,916 (40 hr \u00d7 $72.90/hr) for a \ncompliance specialist to establish training materials. In aggregate, we estimate a one-time burden of 5,960 hours (40 hours \u00d7 149 POs) at a cost of \n$434,484 (5,800 hr. \u00d7 $72.90/hr). \n\u2022Software development: We estimate \nthat PACE organizations will spend 40 hours at a cost of $4,654 (40 hours \u00d7 $116.34/hr) for a software developer to make the appropriate software updates. In aggregate, we estimate a one-time burden of 5,960 hours (40 hours \u00d7 149 \nPOs) at a cost of $693,386 (5,960 hr. \u00d7 $116.34/hr). \n\u2022Storage: We estimate that a PACE \norganization will spend a total of $300 (2 \u00d7 $150/each) for 2 four-drawer \nlocking file cabinets. In aggregate, we estimate a one-time non-labor cost of $44,700 ($300 \u00d7 149 POs). \n\u2022Update policies and procedures: \nWe estimate that PACE organizations will spend 10 hours at a cost of $729 (10 hours \u00d7 $72.90/hr) for a compliance \nspecialist to update and maintain related policies and procedures. In aggregate, we estimate a one-time burden of 1,490 hours (10 hours \u00d7 149 \nPOs) at a cost of $108,621 (1,490 hr. \u00d7 $72.90/hr).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5adbeae3-dbb4-4c6f-b310-aa3daea4713c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5adbeae3-dbb4-4c6f-b310-aa3daea4713c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42e2dfb9-cd1d-4b52-ba8a-d1947d84fd56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9811162862fb5c42e77a2ce6017051a9086eba9eafd84becfd0f653b6dcd4d6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e4fc121-6b24-47fb-892d-ba44ca02e65f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "2df27f4baade4d36b290b0b3f09c851661ef82c6a89f2fcd623eec81eed50b18"}}, "hash": "6c07b83610ba4a90914ca191ba4dae97cad85d679e555fa67c47c17de12d0b4b", "text": "\u00d7 $72.90/hr). \nThe aggregate of this provision is a \none-time impact of 13,410 hours (5960 hours (training materials) + 5960 hours (software development) + 1490 hours (policy updates) at a cost of $1,282,191 ($434,484 (Training materials) + $693,386 (software updates) + $44,700 (nonlabor purchase of storage) + $108,621 (policy updates).) \nSince PACE organizations are already \nrequired to retain original communications related to a participant\u2019s care, health, or safety, and to make these communications accessible to CMS and the SAA upon request, this proposal does not impose any new information collection requirements for PACE organizations. \n25. ICRs Regarding Expanding \nEligibility for Low-Income Subsidies Under Part D of the Medicare Program (\u00a7\u00a7 423.773 and 423.780) \nIn this rule we are proposing to revise \nthe Part D LIS income and resource standards at \u00a7 423.773 to expand eligibility for the full benefit to individuals who currently have the partial benefit and make a coordinating change in \u00a7 423.780. This proposal would change the level of assistance that an individual could qualify for in paying their Part D premiums, copays and deductibles. While there would be no change in the number of individuals eligible for the Part D LIS, it would create a transition of people from partial subsidy status to full benefit status. \nThe burden associated with \ndetermining eligibility for the Part D LIS is the time and effort for States or SSA to verify the income and resources and report eligibility to beneficiaries and CMS annually. Most individuals qualify for the Part D LIS because they qualify for Medicaid or other assistance in their State. The burden for States to determine and report eligibility is currently approved by OMB under control number 0938\u20130467 (CMS\u2013R\u201374) at 54 respondents, 3,241 annual responses, a variable amount of time per response, and 1,082 estimated annual hours. We are not making any changes to any of the requirements or burden under the 0938\u20130467 control number. \nC.

Regulatory Impact Analysis A. Statement of Need \nThe primary purpose of this proposed \nrule is to amend the regulations for the \nMedicare Advantage (Part C) and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) programs, and Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). This proposed rule includes a number of new policies that would improve these programs for Contract Year 2024 as well as codify existing Part C and Part D sub-regulatory guidance. \nThe Parts C and D programs: \n\u2022The Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of \n2018; \n\u2022The Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2021 (CAA); \n\u2022The Substance Use-Disorder \nPrevention that Promotes Opioid \nRecovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act; and \n\u2022The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \n(IRA). \nB. Overall Impact \nWe examined the impact of this \nproposed rule as required by Executive \nOrder 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96\u2013354), Executive Order 13272 on Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking (August 13, 2002), section 1102(b) of the Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104\u20134), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), \nthe Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 \ndirect agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a \u2018\u2018significant regulatory action\u2019\u2019 as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or Tribal governments or communities (also referred to as \u2018\u2018economically significant\u2019\u2019); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. \nThis rule, under Executive Order \n12866, is economically significant as it results in over $100 million in costs, benefits, or transfers annually. In accordance with the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has designated this rule as a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Accordingly, we have prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis that to the best of our ability presents the costs and benefits of the rulemaking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95fe52d7-7bc2-4555-a140-be821a39082f": {"__data__": {"id_": "95fe52d7-7bc2-4555-a140-be821a39082f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "243", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2eb7578f-697e-4df1-b265-3ce7e1530fc9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "243", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c9db64b287b80068aaa5b5809899d8990622dd654af828ecd0b61cc6a65503d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7b8fcdd-767f-4230-83e8-8350de683dac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "243", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "73fc5c9db716325fb4fef786c0138b28d6ed3858d9a6be1058fc539f02482928"}}, "hash": "b9243d12507a4d3ce9c1a95dc9c2b3c9e5b540d695db255d18deb33185491846", "text": "Section 202 of UMRA also requires \nthat agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule \nwhose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2022, that threshold is approximately $165 million. This proposed rule is not anticipated to have an unfunded effect on State, local, or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or on the private sector of $165 million or more. \nExecutive Order 13132 establishes \ncertain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule that imposes substantial direct requirement costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has federalism implications. Since this proposed rule does not impose any substantial costs \non State or local governments, preempt State law or have federalism implications, the requirements of Executive Order 13132 are not applicable. \nIf regulations impose administrative \ncosts on reviewers, such as the time needed to read and interpret this proposed rule, then we should estimate the cost associated with regulatory review. There are currently 795 contracts (which includes MA, MA\u2013PD, and PDP contracts), 55 State Medicaid Agencies, and 300 Medicaid MCOs. We also expect a variety of other organizations to review (for example, consumer advocacy groups, major PBMs). We expect that each organization will designate one person to review the rule. A reasonable maximal number is 2,000 total reviewers. We note that other assumptions are possible. \nUsing the BLS wage information for \nmedical and health service managers (code 11\u20139111), we estimate that the cost of reviewing this proposed rule is $115.22 per hour, including fringe benefits, overhead, and other indirect costs (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/ oes_nat.htm). Assuming an average \nreading speed, we estimate that it will take approximately 19 hours for each \nperson to review this proposed rule. For each entity that reviews the rule, the estimated cost is therefore $2,200 (19 hours \u00d7 $115.22). Therefore, we estimate \nthat the maximum total cost of reviewing this proposed rule is $ 5.3 million ($2200 \u00d7 2,000 reviewers). \nHowever, we expect that many reviewers, for example pharmaceutical companies and PBMs, will not review the entire rule but just the sections that are relevant to them. We expect that on average (with fluctuations) 10 percent of the rule will be reviewed by an individual reviewer; we therefore estimate the total cost of reviewing to be $ 0.5 million. \nNote that this analysis assumes one \nreader per contract. Some alternatives include assuming one reader per parent organization. Using parent organizations instead of contracts will reduce the number of reviewers. However, we believe it is likely that review will be performed by contract. The argument for this is that a parent organization might have local reviewers assessing potential region-specific effects from this proposed rule. \nIn accordance with the provisions of \nExecutive Order 12866, this proposed rule was reviewed by OMB. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00244 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce1c4997-99b1-4513-a4ef-dccb53e39252": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce1c4997-99b1-4513-a4ef-dccb53e39252", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3c2cb0c-559e-41d7-94b8-b1516823efaf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37b2888afb133cab9da89a32c6bb669dd704e7680d8a5d1c8e3655efae4025eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "49b80303-f607-4ffc-b2c9-bc5279d54a33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9a97439738390f7f2b2e35aa9455710b70d8794b87f410c8da8dde6d448f5e19"}}, "hash": "8387b311512a9f4009d00e18dd90a6893c0a16225b836ea31cfe2672d8fd90e7", "text": "79695 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nC. Impact on Small Businesses\u2014 \nRegulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) \nThe RFA, as amended, requires \nagencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small businesses if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. \nA wide range of policies are being \nproposed in this rule. These policies codify, modify, and update current guidance governing MA organization bid requirements. \nThis rule has several affected \nstakeholders. They include: (1) MA organizations such as HMOs, local and regional PPOs, MSAs, PFFS and Part D sponsors; (2) providers, including institutional providers, outpatient providers, clinical laboratories, and pharmacies; and (3) enrollees. Some descriptive data on these stakeholders are as follows: \n\u2022Pharmacies and Drug Stores, NAICS \n446110, have a $30 million threshold for \u2018\u2018small size\u2019\u2019 with 88 percent of pharmacies, those with under 20 employees, considered small. \n\u2022Direct Health and Medical \nInsurance Carriers, NAICS 524114, have a $41.5 million threshold for \u2018\u2018small size,\u2019\u2019 with 75 percent of insurers having under 500 employees meeting the definition of small business. Several Medicare Advantage plans (about 30\u201340 percent) are not-for-profit resulting in a \u2018\u2018small entity\u2019\u2019 status. \n\u2022Ambulatory Health Care Services, \nNAICS 621, including about 2 dozen subspecialties, including Physician Offices, Dentists, Optometrists, Dialysis Centers, Medical Laboratories, Diagnostic Imaging Centers, have a threshold ranging from $8 to $35 million (Dialysis Centers, NAICD 621492, have a $41.5 million threshold). Almost all firms are big, and this also applies to sub-specialties. For example, for Physician Offices, NAICS 621111, receipts for offices with under 9 employees exceed $34 million. \n\u2022Hospitals, NAICS 622, including \nGeneral Medical and Surgical Hospitals, \nPsychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, Specialty Hospitals have a $41.5 million threshold for small size, with half of the hospitals (those with between 20\u2013500 employees) considered small. \n\u2022Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), \nNAICS 623110, have a $30 million threshold for small size, with half of the SNFs (those with under 100 employees) considered small. \nWe are certifying that this FC does not \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nTo explain our position, we explain certain operational aspects of the Medicare program. \nEach year, MA plans submit a bid for \nfurnishing Part A and B benefits and the entire bid amount is paid by the government to the plan if the plan\u2019s bid is below an administratively set benchmark. If the plan\u2019s bid exceeds that benchmark, the beneficiary pays the difference in the form of a basic premium (note that a small percentage of plans bid above the benchmark, whereby enrollees pay basic premium, thus this percentage of plans is not \u2018\u2018significant\u2019\u2019 as defined by the RFA and as justified in this section of this rule). \nMA plans can also offer enhanced \nbenefits, that is, benefits not covered under Original Medicare. These enhanced benefits are paid for through enrollee premiums, extra government payments or a combination. Under the statutory payment formula, if the bid submitted by a Medicare Advantage plan for furnishing Part A and B benefits is lower than the administratively set benchmark, the government pays a portion of the difference to the plan in the form of a rebate. The rebate must be used to provide supplemental benefits (that is. benefits not covered under Original Medicare) and or/lower beneficiary Part B or Part D premiums. Some examples of these supplemental benefits include vision, dental, and hearing, fitness and worldwide coverage of emergency and urgently needed services. \nTo the extent that the government\u2019s \npayments to plans for the bid plus the rebate exceeds costs in Original Medicare, those additional payments \nput upward pressure on the Part B premium which is paid by all Medicare beneficiaries, including those in Original Medicare who do not have the additional health services available in many MA plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49b80303-f607-4ffc-b2c9-bc5279d54a33": {"__data__": {"id_": "49b80303-f607-4ffc-b2c9-bc5279d54a33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3c2cb0c-559e-41d7-94b8-b1516823efaf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "37b2888afb133cab9da89a32c6bb669dd704e7680d8a5d1c8e3655efae4025eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce1c4997-99b1-4513-a4ef-dccb53e39252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "8387b311512a9f4009d00e18dd90a6893c0a16225b836ea31cfe2672d8fd90e7"}}, "hash": "9a97439738390f7f2b2e35aa9455710b70d8794b87f410c8da8dde6d448f5e19", "text": "Part D plans, including MA\u2013PD \nplans,submit bids and those amounts are paid to plans through a combination Medicare funds and beneficiary premiums. In addition, for enrolled low- income beneficiaries Part D plans receive special government payments to cover most of premium and cost sharing amounts those beneficiaries would otherwise pay. \nThus, the cost of providing services \nby these insurers is funded by a variety of government fundingand in some cases by enrollee premiums. As a result, MA and Part D plans are not expected to incur burden or losses since the private companies\u2019 costs are being supported by the government and enrolled beneficiaries. This lack of expected burden applies to both large and small health plans. \nSmall entities that must comply with \nMA regulations, such as those in this proposed rule, are expected to include the costs of compliance in their bids, thus avoiding additional burden, since the cost of complying with any final rule is funded by payments from the government and, if applicable, enrollee premiums. \nFor Direct Health and Medical \nInsurance Carriers, NAICS 524114, plans estimate their costs for the upcoming year and submit bids and proposed plan benefit packages. Upon approval, the plan commits to providing the proposed benefits, and CMS commits to paying the plan either\u2014(1) the full amount of the bid, if the bid is below the benchmark, which is a ceiling on bid payments annually calculated from original Medicare data; or (2) the benchmark, if the bid amount is greater than the benchmark. \nIf an MA plan bids above the \nbenchmark, section 1854 of the Act requires the MA plan to charge enrollees a premium for that amount. Historically, only 2 percent of plans bid above the benchmark, and they contain roughly 1 percent of all plan enrollees. The CMS threshold for what constitutes a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the RFA is 3 to 5 percent. Since the number of plans bidding above the benchmark is 2 percent, this is not considered substantial for purposes of the RFA. \nThe preceding analysis shows that \nmeeting the direct cost of this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as required by the RFA. \nThere are certain indirect \nconsequences of these provisions which also create impact. We have already explained that 98 percent of the plans bid below the benchmark. Thus, their estimated costs for the coming year are fully paid by the Federal Government. However, the government additionally pays the plan a \u2018\u2018beneficiary rebate\u2019\u2019 amount that is an amount equal to a percentage (between 50 and 70 percent depending on a plan\u2019s quality rating) multiplied by the amount by which the benchmark exceeds the bid. The rebate is used to provide additional benefits to enrollees in the form of reduced cost- sharing or other supplemental benefits, or to lower the Part B or Part D premiums for enrollees. (Supplemental benefits may also partially be paid by enrollee premiums.)

This may be in part due to market forces; a plan lowering supplemental benefits even for 1 year may lose its enrollees to competing plans that offer these supplemental benefits. Thus, it can be advantageous to the plan to temporarily reduce profit margins, rather than reduce supplemental benefits. \nWe note that we do not have \ndefinitive data on this. Plans do not report to CMS the strategies behind their bids. More specifically, when \nsupplemental benefits are reduced, we have no way of knowing the cause for this reduction, whether it be new provisions, market forces, or other causes. Notably, it may be inappropriate to consider the relevant regulatory impacts (and thus the profit considerations) as temporary because the issuance of a series of regulations sustains the effects.\n227As a result, \nchanges in benefits packages may be plausible and we request comment on the assessment of this outcome in association with this proposed rule. \nWe next examine in detail each of the \nother stakeholders and explain how they can bear cost. Each of the following are providers (inpatient, outpatient, or pharmacy) that furnish plan-covered services to plan enrollees for: (1) Pharmacies and Drug Stores, NAICS 446110; (2) Ambulatory Health Care Services, NAICS 621, including about two dozen sub-specialties, including Physician Offices, Dentists, Optometrists, Dialysis Centers, Medical Laboratories, Diagnostic Imaging Centers, and Dialysis Centers, NAICD 621492; (3) Hospitals, NAICS 622, including General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals; and (4) SNFs, NAICS 623110. Whether these providers are contracted \nor, in the case of PPOs and PFFS, not contracted with the MA plan, their aggregate payment for services is the sum of the enrollee cost sharing and plan payments. For non-contracted providers, \u00a7 422.214 and sections 1852(k)(1) and 1866(a)(1)(O) of the Act require that a non-contracted provider accept payment that is at least what they would have been paid had the services been furnished in a fee-for-service setting. For contracted providers, \n\u00a7 422.520 requires that the payment is governed by a mutually agreed upon contract between the provider and the plan. CMS is prohibited from requiring MA plans to contract with a particular healthcare provider or to use a particular price structure for payment under the plan by section 1854(a)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act. Consequently, for these providers, there is no additional cost burden above the already existing burden in original Medicare. \nConsequently, consistent with our \nconclusions stated earlier, the Secretary has certified that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nD. Anticipated Effects \nMany provisions of this proposed rule \nhave negligible impact either because \nthey are technical provisions or are provisions that codify existing guidance. Other provisions have an impact that cannot be quantified or whose estimated impact is zero. Throughout the preamble, we have noted when we estimated that provisions have no impact. Additionally, this Regulatory Impact Analysis discusses several provisions with either zero impact or qualitative impact that cannot be quantified. The remaining provisions are estimated in section VIII of this proposed rule and in this Regulatory Impact Analysis.

Transitional Coverage and Retroactive \nMedicare Part D Coverage for Certain Low-Income Beneficiaries Through the LI NET Program (\u00a7 423.2500 Through \u00a7 423.2536) \nThis proposal would implement \nsection 118 of the CAA, which amends section 1860D\u201314 of the Act, to establish the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition Program as a permanent part of Medicare Part D. This will ensure that the transitional drug coverage currently provided to low- income Medicare beneficiaries under the LI NET demonstration will continue indefinitely. Therefore, we anticipate this proposal will advance health equity by improving low income individuals\u2019 access to continuous, affordable health coverage, consistent with Executive Order 13985, issued January 20, 2021, on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. We also believe this proposal would improve the customer service experience of low-income beneficiaries consistent with the goals of the Executive Order 14058, Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government. \nUsing drug cost data from 2021, the \nCMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) projects the following program costs (in millions of dollars) over the next 10 years: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00246 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4725 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.024</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2Costs TABLE 13: PROJECTED LI NET PROGRAM DRUG COSTS($ in \nMILLIONS) \nFiscal Year \n2024 I 202s I 2026 I 2021 I 202s I 2029 I 2030 I 2031 I 2032 I 2033 \ns I 71 sl 91 91 10 I 11 I 11 I 12 I 13", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa16a67b-bf57-43ab-91ce-368e9c0c7e19": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa16a67b-bf57-43ab-91ce-368e9c0c7e19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ff0fabc-4a66-4efa-aead-819b847d5e39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a5c4ab5c11f67b7b8971a136749c195aee03afa2b2ce10d00d4f458197419316"}, "3": {"node_id": "810fec74-c8ad-449b-b226-6d1f1a98943d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "9a7b76cd828b4b0ccad7b7fa2b9507b7d8d07ddf0398700def16661b4f042e0a"}}, "hash": "fd3b6378bdd31e059331913ed4d4605704e205fd607a7f8f7557f990e62d937b", "text": "79697 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n228Based on 854 MA, cost, and Part D plan \nsponsor contracts in the May 2022 Monthly \nContract and Enrollment Summary Report.

Therefore, these projected costs are the same as what the government would have incurred if the demonstration continued. Further, the costs of the payments provided for under this program will continue, as they were under the demonstration, to be covered through the Medicare Prescription Drug Account within the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. \n2. Review of Medical Necessity \nDecisions by a Physician or Other Health Care Professional With Expertise in the Field of Medicine Appropriate to the Requested Service (\u00a7\u00a7 422.566 and 422.629) \nThe proposal that a physician or other \nhealth professional with expertise in the field of medicine appropriate to the requested service determine medical necessity is intended to provide a more meaningful clinical review informed by specific expertise. We believe this enhanced level of review will reduce unnecessary appeals, delays in treatment and the potential for adverse outcomes. The proposal requires obtaining the opinion of an appropriate expert at the organization determination level of review, which we believe will reduce denied organization determinations and, in turn, will reduce the number of cases getting into the appeals process. \nWhile we can (and have) quantified \nthe expected reduced appeals in the Collection of Information section, quantifying the costs of effects of delay in treatment and consequent possible adverse medical complications is not possible because we lack adequate data. For example, we lack data on the following: (1) currently how often do doctors without expertise determine medical necessity; (2) what percentage of these determinations are appealed and what percentage of these appeals are overturned; (3) of the overturned appeals what percentage of cases have medical complications specifically \narising from delays; (4) of the upheld appeals what percentage have adverse medical complications directly attributable to the lack of original treatment; and (5) what is the average cost of these consequent adverse medical complications. In addition to requesting comment related to estimation of these listed effects, regarding the opportunity cost of medical experts\u2019 time when reallocated for the purpose of compliance with this provision, we welcome feedback related to whether this is a budget neutral reallocation, or whether a more detailed analysis would show added cost. \n3. Updating Translation Standards for \nRequired Materials and Content (\u00a7\u00a7 422.2267 and 423.2267) \na. Standing Request for Translated \nMaterials and Materials in Accessible Formats Using Auxiliary Aids and Services \nWe are proposing to specify in \nMedicare regulations that MA organizations, cost plans, and Part D sponsors must provide materials to enrollees on a standing basis in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services or any non-English languages that is the primary language of at least 5 percent of the individuals in a plan benefit package service area upon receiving a request for the materials or otherwise learning of the enrollee\u2019s preferred language. The proposal would also extend to individualized plans of care for special needs plans. \nOur proposed rule clarifies existing \npolicy, therefore the impact to MA organizations, cost plans, and Part D plan sponsors depends on whether, and to what extent, they currently have processes in place to note an enrollee\u2019s language preference and need for auxiliary aids and services. As described in this section of this proposed rule, we believe many plans would not incur significant cost from the proposed requirement because plans currently comply with the proposal. \nEnrollees who need translated \nmaterials or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services who are enrolled in MA, cost, or Part D plans that do not currently create a standing request for these materials would likely spend less time contacting their plan to request these materials as a result of this proposal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "810fec74-c8ad-449b-b226-6d1f1a98943d": {"__data__": {"id_": "810fec74-c8ad-449b-b226-6d1f1a98943d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ff0fabc-4a66-4efa-aead-819b847d5e39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a5c4ab5c11f67b7b8971a136749c195aee03afa2b2ce10d00d4f458197419316"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa16a67b-bf57-43ab-91ce-368e9c0c7e19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "fd3b6378bdd31e059331913ed4d4605704e205fd607a7f8f7557f990e62d937b"}}, "hash": "9a7b76cd828b4b0ccad7b7fa2b9507b7d8d07ddf0398700def16661b4f042e0a", "text": "Any MA, cost, or Part D plan that has not created a standing request for enrollees requiring translated materials or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services would likely reduce their efforts to accept requests and resend the translated materials or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services. \nCMS received information from \nMedicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs) in Ohio and California about their requests for translated materials in 2021 and 2022. We include our assumptions from these discussions, but we are seeking comment on additional information that may better inform our estimates. Of the five MMPs in Ohio in 2021, only one of the plans accepted standing requests for \ntranslated materials or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services. A higher proportion (86 percent) of seven California MMPs that responded had established standing requests due to State oversight ensuring California MMPs followed the State- specific marketing guidance; however, we believe the Ohio MMPs landscape betters represents MA organizations as a whole. Therefore, we estimate that 20 percent or 171\n228MA organization, cost \nplan, and Part D plan sponsor contracts are currently accepting standing requests and would not be impacted by this proposal. Therefore, an estimated 80 percent or 683 MA organization, cost plan, and Part D plan sponsor contracts would need to implement this proposed requirement. We believe our analysis of MMP plans, which cover Part C and Part D benefits, also applies to MA organization, cost plan, and Part D plan sponsors. We request comment on whether MA organization, cost plan, and Part D plan sponsors accept standing requests for translated materials or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services at a greater or lesser extent than MMPs. \nBased on the information we received \nfrom MMPs, we are uncertain if establishing a standing request for translated material or materials in an accessible format using auxiliary aids and services will increase or decrease administrative cost for the estimated 683 MA organization, cost plan, and Part D plan sponsor contracts impacted by our proposal.

Require FIDE SNPs and HIDE SNPs \nand Applicable Integrated Plans To Translate Materials Into the Medicare Translation Standard Plus Additional Medicaid Languages \nWe are proposing to require that FIDE \nSNPs, HIDE SNPs and AIPs translate materials into any languages required by the Medicare translation standard plus any additional languages required by the Medicaid translation standard as specified through their Medicaid capitated contracts. \nOur proposed rule slightly modifies \nexisting policy, so the impact to FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs depends upon whether, and to what extent, these plans are already translating materials in ways that would meet our proposed requirements. We note that translation requirements vary by State. Therefore, we expect no impact in States where the applicable Medicaid and Medicaid translation requirements result in the same outcome. We expect marginal impacts where State requirements result in translation into languages not required by the current MA rules at \u00a7\u00a7 422.2267(a)(2) and 423.2267(a)(2). However, even in these States, FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, AIPs (in combination \nwith their affiliated Medicaid managed care plans) have translators on staff or access them via contractors because of existing translation requirements. \nFor contract year 2022, MA \norganizations sponsor 292 FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs. We expect that some portion of these FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs already translate their Medicare materials in ways that meet our proposed requirement, but we do not have good estimate of how many. While HPMS identifies the Medicare translation requirements for each MA and Part D plan sponsor at the plan level, we do not have a good source of the State-specific Medicaid translation requirements since they differ by State and there is no one source of information outlining these requirements. For purposes of this \nanalysis, we estimate that 75 percent of the FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs currently translate their Medicare materials in ways that would meet our proposed requirement and 25 percent or 73 of these FIDE SNPs, HIDE SNPs, and AIPs do not. \nSection 422.2267(e) requires MA \nplans to provide 29 materials to current and prospective MA plan enrollees, as applicable and \u00a7 423.2267(e) requires Part D sponsors to provide an additional 18 materials to current and prospective enrollees for a total of 47 materials.

Any additional documents needing translation would be a one-time cost with a smaller cost to update the documents in future contract years. \n4. Part D Medication Therapy \nManagement (MTM) Program Targeting Requirements (\u00a7 423.153) \nWe are proposing to revise \n\u00a7 423.153(d)(2) to: (1) codify the current 9 core chronic diseases in regulation, and add HIV/AIDS to the list of core chronic diseases for a total of 10 core chronic diseases and require Part D sponsors to include all core chronic diseases in their MTM targeting criteria; (2) lower the maximum number of Part D drugs a Part D sponsor may require from 8 to 5 drugs and require sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs in their targeting criteria; and (3) change the annual cost threshold methodology to be commensurate with the average annual cost of 5 generic drugs ($1,004 in 2020). We estimate that these proposals would increase the number of Part D beneficiaries eligible for MTM services. \nThese proposed changes would allow \nus to address specific problems identified in the Part D MTM program by improving access to MTM services for enrollees with multiple chronic conditions who are taking multiple Part D drugs, reducing marked variability in MTM eligibility across plans, better aligning with Congressional intent to improve medication use and reduce the risk of adverse events by focusing more on case complexity and drug regimen, and establishing a more reasonable cost threshold that would keep the MTM program size manageable. Almost all of the chronic diseases that CMS is proposing to codify as core chronic diseases are more prevalent among underserved populations, including \nminority and lower income populations. As a result, we anticipate that our proposed changes will increase eligibility rates among those populations, promoting consistent, equitable, and expanded access to MTM services. \nWe estimate that these proposals \nwould increase the number and percentage of Part D enrollees eligible for MTM services from 4.5 million (9 percent) to 11.4 million (23 percent). Although the increase in MTM program enrollment is estimated to cost $336,121,888 for the provision of required MTM services, we cannot definitively score this proposal because there may be other administrative costs attributable to MTM, and MTM program costs are not a specific line item that can \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00248 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a84d2327-3cc5-4a93-8ca1-b1878860da28": {"__data__": {"id_": "a84d2327-3cc5-4a93-8ca1-b1878860da28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17099d1d-b3f3-479d-96ef-31ee166af87a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a90b936729d01664d4b435d9f25d1395228c1c699c8041e5921fadc1e7e36c0e"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ff9f027-b83c-400a-bd8f-752430e5dadb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "acba218bee2d3897daeb70716a46e0f8442bbb178af5d99d614de9cc1abcb59a"}}, "hash": "ff9eacf576d7a2e66840d1d2d71547f15ad1c939c7c3c978273c4c82c9ee5ceb", "text": "79699 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n233Ramalho de Olivera, D; Brummel, A; Miller, D. \nMedication Therapy Management: 10 Years of \nExperience in a Large Integrated Health Care System J Manag Care Pharm. 2010;16(3):185\u201395. be easily extracted from the bid. \nAdditionally, published studies have found that MTM services may generate overall medical savings, for example, through reduced adverse outcomes including reduced hospitalizations and readmissions, outpatient encounters, or nursing home admissions.\n233CMS is \nunable to generate reliable savings estimates from the published studies due to limitations in potential study design, including the lack of a control group and numerous intervening variables.

MSA enrollees receive a lump- sum deposited at the beginning of the calendar year or on the first month coverage begins in the plan (if the enrollee is entitled to Medicare in the middle of the year and he/she joins a Medicare MSA plan at that time). The funds deposited in the Medical Savings Account for health care expenses can be used to pay for the enrollee\u2019s health care before the high deductible is reached. \nIf an MSA enrollee is disenrolled, \nmid-year, for the first of the month after no longer meeting the MSA eligibility criteria, CMS will recover the remaining whole months from the disenrolled beneficiary by offsetting any amount Medicare pays the plan for new \nenrollees in a month. \n\u2022Involuntarily disenrolled \nindividuals would be defaulted to enrollment in Original Medicare, as proposed in \u00a7 422.74(e)(1), which will now pay claims incurred by the former MSA enrollee.

In other words, the three effects are largely cancelled out resulting in an insignificant impact to the Medicare Trust Funds. MA costs and FFS costs are somewhat different due to differences in between the two programs regarding provider contracting and coding intensity, as well as pricing for margin and profits. However, because the number of individuals who are involuntarily disenrolled from MA MSA plans is expected to be very small, the overall impact to the Medicare Trust Funds is insignificant. \n7.

Hence, we anticipate there will be no, or negligible, impact on the Medicare Trust Fund from these routine changes we are proposing in this rule. Beyond the Trust Fund, there may be effects on supplemental benefits, premiums, and plan profits. These impacts will likely vary significantly from plan to plan (or contract to contract) based on the business strategies and the competitive landscape for each plan and contract. \nWe are also proposing some \nmethodological enhancements to the Star Ratings as follows: replacing the current reward factor with an HEI reward, reducing the weight of patient experience/complaints and access measures, removing guardrails, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00249 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af6989a4-34bb-45a5-a805-367bf978870b": {"__data__": {"id_": "af6989a4-34bb-45a5-a805-367bf978870b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "463d5b76-b3a1-41f6-81e0-25ad93d0960e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "dcf641d04736b932b45a9b37a429f5030dd7b79bb14229614194e75cecabb105"}}, "hash": "e5ea37354bfaceb6a7c1f533566d1b21141e7fcdf1fec1ef8593349dd7a360d7", "text": "79700 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nmodifying the hold harmless policy \nused for the improvement measures, adding a rule for the sub-regulatory removal of Star Ratings measures when a measure steward other than CMS retires the measure, and removing the 60 percent rule that is applied when adjusting Star Ratings for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (for example, natural disasters like hurricanes or public health emergencies). We anticipate that removing guardrails, removing the 60 percent rule, and adding a rule for subregulatory measure removal would each have a negligible impact on the highest ratings. Three of our proposed \nenhancements have the potential to cause a contract\u2019s Star Rating to change: (1) applying the improvement measure highest rating hold harmless provision only to 5 star contracts instead of for those contracts with a rating of 4 or higher stars; (2) decreasing the weight of patient experience, complaints, and access measures from four to two; and (3) replacing the current reward factor with an HEI that would reward contracts for doing well serving enrollees with various social risk factors. We simulated the cumulative impact \nof the proposed changes on MA\u2013PD \ncontracts by contract size using the 2021 Star Ratings. Consistent with what we have observed historically, there is more enrollment in high performing contracts as seen in Table 14. All enrollment categories see a small decrease in the average overall rating ranging from \u20130.06 to \u20130.15 under this simulation. The amount of the decrease in the overall rating increases as the enrollment size categories increase, with the proposed changes having a somewhat larger impact for higher rated contracts. \nWe also simulated the cumulative \nimpact of the proposed changes to the overall rating by geographical area\u2014 specifically, by State, DC, and Puerto Rico. Since the service area of a contract can include multiple states, we assigned to each enrollee the rating of their MA contract and calculated the average rating across all enrollees residing in each State. The average change in the overall rating is a decrease of 0.17, with the changes ranging from 0.0 to \u20130.37 across geographic areas. Table 15 shows the simulated changes by State, DC, and Puerto Rico. The second column is the number of MA enrollees in each State in contracts that received the 2021 overall rating. In most cases, but not all, there are larger declines in areas that had on average higher 2021 overall ratings. \nBILLING CODE 4120\u201301\u2013P \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00250 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.025</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2TABLE 14: OVERALL RATING SIMULATIONS BY CONTRACT SIZE \n2021 \nNumber Overall Simulated \nof Rating Overall Rating \nEnrollment Catee:orv Contracts Averae:e Averae:e Difference \n< 5,000 76 3.54 3.48 -0.06 \n>= 5.000 -< 25.000 137 3.69 3.62 -0.07 \n>= 25,000 -< 100 000 125 3.94 3.84 -0.10 \n>= 100,000 55 4.13 3.97 -0.15", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48bfcf20-3c89-4691-8d54-1f6b981d6c3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "48bfcf20-3c89-4691-8d54-1f6b981d6c3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "250", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "76352ed3-a6a8-4c96-83c0-3df5bd8e89a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "250", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "1d771ece31d82a4488143693719af2d7dfa2338eae0a4515b4a3a155a52bb0b1"}}, "hash": "103636dc95249a37291819db2d7128f2ddf13b9207ffc1e3b0c717d706acc6bc", "text": "79701 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00251 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4725 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.026</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2TABLE 15: STAR RATINGS SIMULATIONS BY STATE, DC AND PUERTO RICO \nNumber of 2021 Overall Simulated \nState Enrollees Ratine: Overall Ratine: Difference \nAK 1524 4.08 3.94 -0.14 \nAL 443 969 4.24 3.96 -0.28 \nAR 170,915 3.59 3.44 -0.15 \nAZ 521,901 3.76 3.71 -0.05 \nCA 2 657 281 4.46 4.43 -0.02 \nco 367,021 4.30 4.10 -0.21 \nCT 271 820 4.07 3.96 -0.10 \nDC 19,146 4.32 4.13 -0.18 \nDE 34,468 3.95 3.86 -0.09 \nFL 2 111 559 4.11 3.95 -0.16 \nGA 697 263 3.92 3.77 -0.15 \nHI 127,315 4.05 3.74 -0.31 \nIA 131,963 3.97 3.85 -0.13 \nID 113,540 3.80 3.72 -0.08 \nIL 548 385 4.11 3.87 -0.24 \nIN 402,282 3.98 3.74 -0.23 \nKS 97,754 3.85 3.69 -0.15 \nKY 313,488 3.90 3.65 -0.25 \nLA 339,228 4.24 3.98 -0.26 \nMA 309 105 4.55 4.18 -0.37 \nMD 127 039 4.28 4.00 -0.28 \nME 119,565 4.43 4.10 -0.33 \nMI 819,565 3.76 3.69 -0.08 \nMN 458 194 4.31 3.95 -0.36 \nMO 445 550 4.12 3.84 -0.28 \nMS 123,683 3.70 3.49 -0.21 \nMT 44,284 4.00 3.93 -0.07 \nNC 746,214 4.13 3.96 -0.17 \nND 23,931 4.02 3.92 -0.10 \nNE 56 025 4.13 3.90 -0.23 \nNH 55,680 3.98 3.74 -0.23 \nNJ 484,539 3.87 3.83 -0.05 \nNM 153,762 3.73 3.63 -0.09 \nNV 199 573 3.92 3.87 -0.05 \nNY 1510549 3.82 3.72 -0.10 \nOH 943,397 3.98 3.90 -0.08 \nOK 149,407 3.75 3.63 -0.12 \nOR 391 460 4.13 3.89 -0.25 \nPA 1 157 687 4.10 3.98 -0.12 \nPR 592 702 4.03 4.03 0.00 \nRI 84,615 4.02 3.87 -0.15 \nSC 310,810 3.73 3.57 -0.16 \nSD 37 222 3.99 3.85 -0.13 \nTN 548 221 4.11 4.01 -0.10", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5983a8de-12c2-4c9b-8464-a1bde96eda8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5983a8de-12c2-4c9b-8464-a1bde96eda8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fb54eb7-ea27-43a2-a9f5-a51573100492", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "c8e706ed06137baa7239974eaf4e4adf8fc4d4abd94825abb38967bb25909039"}}, "hash": "e53173c96fcda7a3e4eeeb74d9402bf748db2d832abc352c23c2d150dbc7e839", "text": "79702 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nBILLING CODE 4120\u201301\u2013C \nWe calculated the cost impacts \nsummarized in Tables 12 and 13 due to \nthese proposed Star Ratings updates by quantifying the difference in the MA organization\u2019s final Star Rating with the proposed changes and without the proposed changes. We assume Medicare Trust Fund impacts due to the Star Ratings changes associated with these three proposed revisions to the methodology. The first two of these changes would be effective for the 2026 Star Ratings and would impact the 2027 plan payments and 2027 Quality Bonus Payments. The introduction of the HEI reward in lieu of the current reward factor would impact the 2027 Star Ratings and would impact the 2028 plan payments and 2028 Quality Bonus Payments. \nAll impacts are considered transfers, \nbut we request comment on the extent to which provision of goods or services would increase or decrease in \nassociation with the payment changes. The impact analysis for the Star Ratings updates takes into consideration the final quality ratings for those contracts that would have Star Ratings changes under this proposed rule. There are two ways that Star Ratings changes will \nimpact the Medicare Trust Fund: \n\u2022A Star Rating of 4.0 or higher will \nresult in a QBP for the MA contract, which, in turn, leads to a higher benchmark for the MA plans offered by the MA organization under that contract. MA organizations that achieve an overall Star Rating of at least 4.0 qualify for a QBP that is capped at 5 percent (or 10 percent for certain counties). \n\u2022The rebate share of the savings will \nbe higher for those MA organizations that achieve a higher Star Rating. The rebate share of savings amounts to 50 percent for plans with a rating of 3.0 or fewer stars, 65 percent for plans with a rating of 3.5 or 4.0 stars, and 70 percent for plans with a rating of 4.5 or 5.0 stars. \nIn order to estimate the impact of the \nStar Ratings updates, the Private Health Baseline assumptions are updated with the assumed Star Ratings changes \ndescribed in this proposed rule. We first estimated the three proposed changes to the Star Ratings calculations as independent of each other and, since there are likely overall Star Rating interactions between the three changes, the impacts, as shown in Table 16, should be viewed separately and should not be summed. The negative values in \nthis section of this proposed rule represent net savings to the Medicare Trust Funds. For the improvement measure hold harmless provision, net savings are estimated to be between $2.08 billion in 2027 and $3.52 billion in 2033, resulting in a ten year savings estimate of $19.53 billion, which equates to 0.3 percent of the Private Health Baseline for the years 2024 through 2033. The patient experience/ complaints and access measure weight provision is expected to result in net savings of between $330 million in 2027 and $580 million in 2033, resulting in a 10 year savings estimate of $3.28 billion. This amount equates to 0.05 percent of the Private Health Baseline for 2024\u20132033. The replacement of the current reward factor with the HEI reward is expected to result in net savings of between $670 million in 2028 and $1,050 million in 2033 resulting in a 10-year savings estimate of $5.12 billion. $5.12 billion represents 0.08 percent of the Private Health Baseline \nfor the years 2024\u20132033. These projections are based on simulations using data from the 2020 and 2021 Star Ratings. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00252 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.027</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2Number of 2021 Overall Simulated \nState Enrollees Ratin2 Overall Ratin2 Difference \nTX 1,638,848 3.95 3.79 -0.17 \nUT 148,224 3.95 3.65 -0.30 \nVA 335,867 3.91 3.80 -0.11 \nVT 17,644 3.86 3.57 -0.28 \nWA 450.597 4.05 3.80 -0.24 \nWI 488,875 4.14 3.94 -0.20 \nWV 133,231 3.90 3.61 -0.29 \nWY 4,101 3.60 3.49 -0.11", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7ca9a0e-086d-4fc3-9e72-7438acd080fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7ca9a0e-086d-4fc3-9e72-7438acd080fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "252", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f13cdf3-0b01-42a1-bc86-15808ccca16f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "252", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f341b6228eb578a60e9bacd1d1aa32ee6415cb8b21439489e048229225d5aab8"}}, "hash": "ee2342c5bb564b93045d11eaf9825f8fc89172b4a11b3d284e0d3947e937d52f", "text": "79703 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \nWe also estimated the cumulative \nimpact of the proposed changes to the \nStar Ratings calculations since there are interactions between the changes.

The following table reflects the scored government costs for expanding the full LIS subsidy to the current partially-subsidized LIS beneficiaries starting January 1, 2024. Included in this table are the breakdown of increases for both the low income cost-sharing subsidy (LICS) and the low income premium subsidy (LIPS). OACT arrived at the cost estimate by assuming that the ratio of post-LICS-out-of-pocket as a percentage to the total drug cost for the partial subsidy beneficiaries would be similar to that of the full subsidy beneficiaries. In other words, (plan benefits + LICS)/total drug cost for the partial subsidy beneficiaries will be the same as that for the full subsidy beneficiaries. \nE. Alternatives Considered \nIn this section, CMS includes \ndiscussions of Alternatives Considered \nfor several provisions. Several provisions of this proposed rule reflect a codification of existing policy where we have evidence, as discussed in the appropriate preamble sections, that the codification of this existing policy would not affect compliance. In such cases, the preamble typically discusses the effectiveness metrics of these provisions for public health. Also, in these cases,, different enforcement methods and different levels of stringency, are not fully relevant since the provision is already being complied with adequately. Alternative analysis is not provided for these provisions. \n1. Medicare Final Settlement Process \nand Final Settlement Appeals Process for Organizations and Sponsors That Are Consolidating, Non-Renewing, or Otherwise Terminating a Contract (\u00a7\u00a7 422.500(b), 423.501, 422.528, \n423.521, 422.529, and 423.522) \nAs an alternative to our proposal to \nrequire MA organizations and Part D sponsors respond to CMS with a summary of their agreement or disagreement with the final settlement amount, we considered two others approaches. \nFirst, we considered requiring a \nresponse by all contracts, regardless of whether or not they disagreed with CMS\u2019s calculation of the final settlement amount. This would result in an aggregate burden of $26,931. \nSecond, we considered requiring MA \norganizations and Part D sponsors that are consolidating, non-renewing, or terminating their contract to internally calculate the final settlement amount, have a financial officer attest that the final settlement amount meets actuarial standards, and report to CMS the results within a specified timeframe. For purposes of this alternative, we are using the same assumption detailed in the ICR regarding final settlement. We would add the burden of attestation which is the burden of a chief executive and manager taking 1 hour each for the purposes of meeting to describe the final settlement amount and attest to the accuracy of the calculation. As indicated in section VII.B.16. of this \nproposed rule historically, on average, from the period 2015 through 2020, 44 contracts agreed with the CMS decision on final settlement amount and 3 requested a review. \nThe revised increased burden would \nbe $1,018 (3 contracts * 2 hours for attestation * $169.67). \nFor comparisons we list these two \napproaches and the approach, we adopted in VII.C.14. of this proposed rule. \n\u2022Finalized approach: Total burden of \n$15,712. \n\u2022Alternate approach where every \ncontract writes a summary: $26,931. \n\u2022An addendum of attestation to \neither of the above 2 approaches: An additional $1,018. \nFurther information is provided in \nTable 19 in this section of this rule.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b9f7139-52a9-4d7c-8a1d-09ad9d44fef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b9f7139-52a9-4d7c-8a1d-09ad9d44fef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60e841cf-68ed-4ccb-b3c4-65435328fb3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "da5ba71accc758fb5e72c81f09b4caa231aed5fe5a7ef922b43d4ae92e1503d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "112cee75-a09c-4039-be6f-a0087257ec5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "f9191cbeca9a2244f5e123233374d1c56d9deb45a4f9df992a83f0bc5870161b"}}, "hash": "b7169fe33845ce8e7e42bf79f9882b279639f5ce5a70182f19ca03e2eeac8913", "text": "Further information is provided in \nTable 19 in this section of this rule. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 23:16 Dec 23, 2022 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00254 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4725 E:\\FR\\FM\\27DEP2.SGM 27DEP2\nEP27DE22.030</GPH> EP27DE22.031</GPH>TKELLEY on DSK125TN23PROD with PROPOSALS2TABLE 18: PROJECTED COSTS FOR EXPANDING LOW INCOME SUBSIDIES \nCalendar Year Incurred ($ in millions) \n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 \nLIS total $169 $180 $193 $207 $221 $237 $253 $269 $286 $304 \nLICS $135 $144 $155 $166 $178 $191 $205 $218 $232 $247 \nLIPS $34 $36 $38 $41 $43 $46 $48 $51 $54 $57 \nTABLE 19: TOTAL STAFF BURDEN (hr) FOR CALCULATING FINAL \nSETTLEMENT \nBurden per Entity for \nRequired Tasks Total burden per entity \nOccupation (in hours) Wa2e/hr ($) ($) \nManagers 1 134.52 134.52 \nChief Executive 1 204.82 204.82 \nTotal 2 169.67 339.34", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed229ea5-ef6f-4b9a-b2dc-976d38bc356e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed229ea5-ef6f-4b9a-b2dc-976d38bc356e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "28c7e87d-6b3a-4bdd-a6f2-fd291f5f24bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "460da9b57ade9d247a4fde16f6e3615bbad0538d7e51d81abf64d6e1a9ed55b0"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e16b085-4c51-4239-b4b6-41b74f3e1d62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "a0091dc0d1d017df1d3866a72a8b4f928ad46cf7fa88c8e711b75c53dfb211a8"}}, "hash": "36aaf9a57a2cd1446ceb75fa705e426fb93beefa02faacba3f1687f21a7a40e6", "text": "79705 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 247 / Tuesday, December 27, 2022 / Proposed Rules \n234M.-C.

We are not proposing the first \nalternative because we do not believe \nthat adding a requirement to our current process for MA organizations and Part D sponsors to acknowledge receipt of the notice of final determination and indicate they agree with the final determination amount is beneficial. CMS believes this will not enhance our process by providing CMS information on whether an MA organization or Part D sponsor agrees with the final settlement and instead propose that MA organizations and Part D sponsors request a review of the CMS calculated final settlement amount if they disagree. \nWe are not proposing the second \nalternative because we believe that requiring MA organizations and Part D sponsors to calculate the final settlement amount would introduce a significant financial and administrative burden on MA organizations and Part D sponsors that are consolidating, non- renewing, or terminating without improving on the efficiency of our proposed process. \n2. Part D Medication Therapy \nManagement (MTM) Program Targeting Criteria (\u00a7 423.153) \nWe considered two alternatives to our \nproposal. The first alternative we considered would maintain our proposed changes related to chronic diseases and Part D drug utilization, but would establish a cost threshold commensurate with the average annual cost of 2 Part D maintenance drugs. Under this alternative, CMS would calculate the dollar amount based on the average daily cost of both brand and generic drugs identified as maintenance drugs in Medi-Span. Based on 2020 PDE data, the cost threshold under this alternative would be $1,657, with an estimated program size of about 9,363,087 beneficiaries (19.53 percent of the total Part D population) and an \nestimated increased burden of $251,600,394. \nThe second alternative we considered \nwould include our proposed changes related to chronic diseases, retain the current maximum number of Part D drugs a sponsor may require for MTM program enrollment at 8 drugs, require sponsors to include all Part D maintenance drugs in their targeting criteria, and establish a cost threshold commensurate with the average annual cost of 5 generic maintenance drugs. Under this alternative, CMS would calculate the dollar amount of the cost threshold as proposed but would only include generic maintenance drugs. Based on 2020 PDE data, the cost threshold under this alternative would be $840, with an estimated program size of 7,924,203 beneficiaries (16.53 percent \nof the total Part D population) and an estimated increased burden of $177,022,820. \nWe are not proposing the first \nalternative primarily because a cost threshold at $1,657 would continue to exclude too many Part D enrollees who meet the other targeting criteria. Based on 2020 data, between 25 and 50 percent of the Part D enrollees who have 3 or more core chronic diseases and are taking 5 or more Part D maintenance \ndrugs would be ineligible because their annual Part D covered drug cost may not meet or exceed this cost threshold amount (25th percentile is $823; median is $2,778); therefore, many eligibility gaps based on Part D drug spend would persist. We also have concerns that including brand drugs in the cost threshold calculation could potentially contribute to greater volatility in the dollar amount each year. \nWe are not proposing the second \nalternative because, as discussed in section III.R. of this proposed rule, we want to reduce MTM eligibility gaps to ensure that more individuals who would most benefit from MTM services have access. Individuals taking 5 or more prescription drugs are associated with a higher risk of potentially inappropriate medication use.\n234Thus, \nwe believe it is appropriate to reduce the maximum number of Part D drugs a sponsor may require for MTM program enrollment to 5 drugs, as reflected in our proposed changes. \nOverall, we believe our proposed \nchanges represent the best way to address unmet beneficiary needs while balancing program size and burden on Part D sponsors. \n3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e16b085-4c51-4239-b4b6-41b74f3e1d62": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e16b085-4c51-4239-b4b6-41b74f3e1d62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "28c7e87d-6b3a-4bdd-a6f2-fd291f5f24bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "460da9b57ade9d247a4fde16f6e3615bbad0538d7e51d81abf64d6e1a9ed55b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed229ea5-ef6f-4b9a-b2dc-976d38bc356e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "36aaf9a57a2cd1446ceb75fa705e426fb93beefa02faacba3f1687f21a7a40e6"}}, "hash": "a0091dc0d1d017df1d3866a72a8b4f928ad46cf7fa88c8e711b75c53dfb211a8", "text": "3. Utilization Management \nRequirements: Clarifications of Coverage Criteria for Basic Benefits and Use of Prior Authorization, Additional Continuity of Care Requirements, and Annual Review of Utilization Management Tools (\u00a7\u00a7 422.100, 422.101, 422.112, 422.137, 422.138) \nBoth the reasons for proposing the \nUM Committee requirement provisions and the alternatives they are intended to counteract are discussed in the respective preambles. Because we cannot quantify any of these we have not included a repetition of this analysis in the RIA. A brief summary is as follows: \u2022The proposed regulation clarifies \ncoverage criteria of basic benefits \nstandards by requiring MA plans to make medical necessity determinations based on Traditional Medicare coverage and benefit criteria as reflected in Medicare statutes and regulations, NCDs and LCDs and prohibiting the use of internal coverage criteria or additional medical necessity standards except in limited situations. This is major policy shift in which MA plans may only deny coverage for Medicare items and services based on Traditional Medicare coverage rules. We understand that this provision will create new burden which is difficult to quantify. \n\u2022The proposed regulation also \nrequires plans to follow a specific process in developing internal coverage policies and to provide a public summary of evidence that was considered during the development of the internal coverage criteria used to make medical necessity determinations. We provided an impact analysis in section VII.C.4 of this proposed rule of one quantifiable aspect of this proposal. We will also solicit stakeholder input on aspects of the proposal and its impact. \n\u2022The regulation requires a PA \napproval to be valid for the duration of the approved course of treatment. In combination with the proposals to limit when MA plans may deny coverage (or use internal coverage criteria that are not used in Traditional Medicare), this will limit an MA organization\u2019s ability to approve only part of what a provider has ordered or prescribed. In addition, the proposal would minimize repetitive PA requirements for enrollees on an appropriate, chronic, stable therapy. It would be qualitatively beneficial for the enrollee. \n\u2022The proposed regulation establishes \na minimum 90-day transition period when an enrollee switches to a new plan, or switches from FFS to an MA plan (including new MA plan members who are also new to Medicare as well) for any ongoing courses of treatment so \nthat treatment is not interrupted while UM requirements are addressed. This was adopted from similar transition periods in Part D; we believe it is appropriate to align the transition period and scope with the current transition requirements in Part D. This proposal is qualitatively beneficial for the enrollee. \n\u2022The proposed regulation requires \nMA organizations to establish a committee (similar to a P&T committee), led by the Medical Director, that reviews utilization management policies annually and keeps current of Medicare statutes and regulations, LCDs and NCDs.

This is qualitatively beneficial for the enrollee. It was modeled on similar committees used for Part B step therapy programs and by Part D plans. Its major effect is to ask \nplans to review their policies. \nWe re-emphasize that we are not able \nto fully quantify all of these and the discussion of reasons is discussed in the preamble. \n4. Medicare Advantage/Part C and Part \nD Prescription Drug Plan Quality Rating System (\u00a7\u00a7 422.162, 422.164, 422.166, 422.260, 423.182, 423.184, and 423.186) \nAs an alternative to our proposal to \nhave a tiered health equity index reward, we have considered a non- tiered approach. We have proposed a tiered HEI reward structure based on the percentage of enrollees in each contract who have the specified SRFs. We propose that contracts that have percentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRFs in a given year that are greater than or equal to one-half of the contract-level median percentage of enrollees with the specified SRFs up to, \nbut not including, the contract-level median would qualify for one-half of the HEI reward. Contracts that have percentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRFs greater than or equal to the contract-level median would qualify for the full HEI reward. \nWe have also considered and are \nsoliciting comment on an alternative non-tiered HEI reward structure, where all contracts with percentages of enrollees with any of the specified SRF greater than or equal to one-half of the contract-level median would qualify for the full HEI reward. Both the tiered and non-tiered HEI reward structures align with our goals of promoting enrollment of enrollees with SRFs and not rewarding contracts that may do well among enrollees with SRFs but serve very few enrollees in this population, although the tiered HEI reward structure goes further in aligning with these goals. The non-tiered HEI reward structure aligns better with the goal of ease of use and understanding for contracts and other stakeholders. Although the non- tiered approach would slightly increase the mean HEI reward, it does not impact the number of contracts qualifying for \nthe reward. F. Accounting Statement and Table \nThe following Table 20 summarizes \ncosts and transfers by provision. As \nrequired by OMB Circular A\u20134 (available at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/ circulars_ a004_ a-4/), in Table 20, we \nhave prepared an accounting statement showing the costs and transfers \nassociated with the provisions of this final rule for calendar years 2024 through 2033. Table 20 is based on Table 21 which lists transfers and costs by provision and year. Table 20 is expressed in millions of dollars with costs listed as positive numbers and transfers of savings (reduction in dollar spending) to the Medicare Trust Fund listed as a savings. As can be seen, the net annualized cost of this rule is about $580 million per year. This cost is offset by a reduction in dollar spending (savings) to the Medicare Trust Fund of about $2 billion per year. Minor seeming discrepancies in totals in Tables 21 reflects use of underlying spreadsheets, rather than intermediate rounded amounts. A breakdown of these costs of this proposed rule by provision may be found in Table 21. \nThe following Table 21 summarizes \ncosts, and transfers by provision and \nyear and forms a basis for the accounting Table 20. In Table 21, costs are expressed as positive numbers while savings to the Medicare Trust Fund (reduced dollar spending) are expressed as negative numbers. All numbers are in millions. The costs in this table are true costs reflecting increased consumption of services and goods.

Conclusion \nAs indicated in Table 19 the star \nrating provisions whose impact begins \nin 2027 reduces dollar spending of the Medicare Trust Fund by $22.6 billion over 10 years. This is offset by the paperwork costs of this rule which amount to $3.5 billion over 10 years. The major driver of the paperwork costs is the MTM provisions. Over an infinite horizon the aggregate costs of this rule expressed in 2016 dollars is $384 million per year. In accordance with requirements, this major rule has been reviewed by OMB. \nIX.

If the MA organization approved the furnishing of a covered item or service through a prior authorization or pre-service determination of coverage or payment, it may not deny coverage later on the basis of lack of medical necessity unless the MA organization has the authority to reopen the decision for good cause or fraud or similar fault per the reopening provisions at \u00a7 422.616. \n\u25a023.

CMS calculates an overall \nStar Rating, Part C summary rating, and \nPart D summary rating for each MA\u2013PD contract and a Part D summary rating for each PDP contract using the 5-star rating system described in this subpart. For PDP contracts, the Part D summary rating is the highest rating. Measures are assigned stars at the contract level and weighted in accordance with \u00a7 423.186(a). Domain ratings are the unweighted mean of the individual measure ratings under the topic area in accordance with \u00a7 423.186(b). Summary ratings are the weighted mean of the individual measure ratings for Part C or Part D in accordance with \u00a7 423.186(c), with both the reward factor and CAI applied as applicable, as described in \u00a7 423.186(f). Overall Star Ratings are calculated by using the weighted mean of the individual measure ratings in accordance with \u00a7 423.186(d) with both the reward factor and CAI applied as applicable, as described in \u00a7 423.186(f).

Starting with \nthe 2027 Star Ratings year and \nsubsequent Star Ratings years, CMS applies a health equity index rating- specific factor to both the summary and overall ratings of contracts that qualify based on an assessment of contract performance on quality measures among enrollees with certain social risk factors (SRFs). \n(i) The health equity index (HEI) is \ncalculated separately for the overall rating for MA\u2013PDs and cost contracts including the applicable Part C and D measures; Part C summary rating for MA-only, MA\u2013PD, and cost contracts including the applicable Part C measures; Part D summary rating for MA\u2013PDs and cost contracts including the applicable Part D measures; and Part D summary rating for PDPs including the applicable Part D measures. \n(A) The SRFs included in the HEI are \nreceipt of the low income subsidy or being dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (LIS/DE), or having a disability. Enrollees will be identified as LIS/DE or as having a disability as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section. If a person meets the LIS/DE criteria for only one of the two measurement years included in the HEI, the data for that person for just that year are used. Measures that are case-mix adjusted in the Star Ratings would be adjusted using all standard case-mix adjustors for the measure except for those adjusters that are the SRFs of interest in the index, are strongly correlated with the SRFs of interest, or are conceptually similar to the SRFs of interest. \n(B) The HEI is calculated by \ncombining measure-level scores for the subset of enrollees with SRFs of interest included in the HEI across the two most recent measurement years using a modeling approach that includes year as an adjustor to account for potential differences in performance across years and to adjust the data to reflect performance in the second of the 2 years of data used. Data are used for contracts that have data for only the most recent of the 2 years, but data are not used for contracts that have data for only the first of the 2 years. \n(ii) In determining the HEI scores, a \nmeasure will be excluded from the calculation of the index if the measure meets any of the following: \n(A) The focus of the measurement is \nnot the enrollee but rather the plan or provider. \n(B) The measure is retired, moved to \ndisplay, or has a substantive specification change in either year of data used to construct the HEI. \n(C) The measure is applicable only to \nSNPs. \n(D) At least 25 percent of contracts are \nunable to meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section. For Part D measures, this criterion is assessed separately for MA\u2013PDs and cost contracts, and for PDPs. \n(iii) The Star Ratings measures that \nremain after the exclusion criteria in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section have been applied will be included in the calculation of the health equity index.

The rating-specific HEI will then be calculated as the weighted sum of points across all measures included in the index using \nthe Star Ratings measure weight for each measure divided by the weighted sum of the number of eligible measures for the given contract.

A plan crosswalk is the movement of enrollees from one plan benefit package (PBP) in a PDP contract to another PBP under a PDP contract between a Part D Sponsor and CMS. To crosswalk enrollees from one PBP to another is to change the enrollment from the first PBP to the second. \n(2) Prohibitions. (i) Plan crosswalks \nbetween PBPs under one PDP contract and PBPs under another PDP contract are prohibited unless both the PDP sponsors with which CMS contracts are the same legal entity or have the same parent organization. \n(ii) Plan crosswalks are prohibited \nthat split the enrollment of one PBP into multiple PBPs. \n(iii) Plan crosswalks are prohibited \nfrom a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage to a PBP offering enhanced alternative coverage. \n(3) Compliance with renewal/non- \nrenewal rules. The PDP sponsor must comply with renewal and non-renewal rules in \u00a7\u00a7 423.506 and 423.507 in order to complete plan crosswalks. \n(4) Eligibility. Enrollees must be \neligible for enrollment under \u00a7 423.30 in order to be moved from one PBP to another PBP. \n(5) Applicability to employer group \nhealth or waiver plans. Nothing in this section permits the crosswalk of enrollees in an employer group health or waiver plan PBP to another PBP outside the usual process for enrollment in employer group health or waiver plans. \n(b) Mandatory plan crosswalks. A Part \nD sponsor of a PDP must perform a plan crosswalk in the following circumstances: \n(1) Renewal of a PBP offering basic \nprescription drug coverage. A PDP sponsor that plans to continue operating a PBP offering basic prescription coverage in the same service area for the upcoming contract year must crosswalk enrollment from the PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage in the current contract year into a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage under the same PDP contract in the upcoming contract year. The PBP for the upcoming contract year must retain the same plan ID as the PBP for the current contract year; \n(2) Renewal of a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative drug coverage.

If a PDP \nsponsor wishes to non-renew a PBP offering enhanced alternative prescription drug coverage under a PDP contract that is not non-renewing or reducing its service area so that the contract no longer includes the service area of the non-renewing PBP, it may crosswalk enrollment from the non- renewing PBP into a PBP offered under the contract in the upcoming contract year. \n(i) The plan ID for the upcoming \ncontract year PBP must be the same plan ID as one of PBPs for the current contract year. \n(ii) The PBPs being consolidated must \nbe under the same PDP contract. \n(iii) A PBP offering basic prescription \ndrug coverage may not be discontinued if the PDP contract continues to offer coverage (other than employer group waiver plans) in the service area of the PBP. \n(iv) Enrollment from a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative coverage may be crosswalked into a PBP offering either enhanced alternative or basic prescription drug coverage. \n(v) If the PDP contract includes more \nthan one renewing PBP into which enrollment of the non-renewing PBP can be crosswalked, the enrollment of the non-renewing PBP must be crosswalked into the renewing PBP that will result in lowest increase in monthly premiums for the enrollees. \n(vi) A plan crosswalk will not be \napproved under this paragraph if it will result in a premium increase for the following benefit year (as reflected in the bid for the receiving PBP submitted on the first Monday in June) that is higher than the greater of: \n(A) The current year\u2019s premium for \nthe non-renewing PBP; or \n(B) The current year\u2019s average base \nbeneficiary premium, as described in \u00a7 423.286(c) of this part, for the PDP region in which the PBP operates. \n(vii) If an organization that non- \nrenews an enhanced alternative PBP does not request and receive a plan crosswalk exception as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, CMS will not approve a new enhanced alternative PBP in the same service area as the non- renewing PBP in the following contract year.

If a PDP \nsponsor non-renews all or part of the service area of its contract with CMS pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 423.507 or 423.508, the enrollees of the non-renewing PBPs may be crosswalked into one or more PBPs in another PDP contract (the surviving contract). \n(i) The non-renewing PDP contract \nand the surviving contract must be held by the same legal entity or by legal entities with the same parent organization. \n(ii) The approved service area of the \nsurviving contract must include the service area of the non-renewing PBPs whose enrollment will be crosswalked into the surviving contract. \n(iii) Enrollment may be crosswalked \nbetween PBPs offering the same type of prescription drug coverage (basic or enhanced alternative). \n(iv) Enrollment from a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative coverage may be crosswalked into a PBP offering basic prescription drug coverage. \n(v) Enrollment from a PBP offering \nenhanced alternative coverage must be crosswalked into the PBP in the surviving contract that will result in the lowest premium increase. \n(vi) A plan crosswalk will not be \napproved under this paragraph if it will result in a premium increase for the following benefit year (as reflected in the bid for the receiving PBP submitted on the first Monday in June) that is higher than the greater of: \n(A) The current year\u2019s premium for \nthe non-renewing PBP; or \n(B) The current year\u2019s average base \nbeneficiary premium, as described in \u00a7 423.286(c) of this part, for the region in which the PBP operates. \n(d) Procedures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31f769c9-b899-456f-835f-cbdb70c10ec5": {"__data__": {"id_": "31f769c9-b899-456f-835f-cbdb70c10ec5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e273ee5-527b-44d8-ad2d-686342fbc282", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "0bdb02acc2693b9a6f60ec605e71a5021cffd3d95d373a09bc278173b382c831"}, "2": {"node_id": "004edec2-18a0-4ef3-8231-0e6f870176d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "medicare_program_contract_year_2024.pdf"}, "hash": "331a9c0ce1c99ece306c04ca69bed56d6a4bd533c08541a1d2a508407db71b64"}}, "hash": "a1f19af48fa1e91971c4aef97fa3998ec728b261c7184c54cd3dc1c4fd603fe6", "text": "(d) Procedures.

CMS provides \nadvance monthly LI NET payments equal to the sum of Payment Rates A and B as established in the LI NET sponsor\u2019s approved bid, as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. LI NET payments are made on a prospective per-member, per-month basis. \n(1) Payment Rate A is an annual rate \nof payment for projected administrative costs. An annual percentage-based cap on Payment Rate A limiting the year over year increase to Payment Rate A is set as part of the bid review and negotiation under \u00a7 423.272(a). \n(i) For the 2024 plan year, the LI NET \nsponsor includes in their bid the assumption that Payment Rate A cannot exceed a 2% increase from the prior year\u2019s Payment A, which is a figure CMS will provide to the LI NET sponsor. \n(ii) For the 2025 plan going forward, \nthe LI NET sponsor will specify their assumption for any increase needed to the prior year\u2019s Payment Rate A, submitting justification to CMS in their bid if the cap exceeds 2%. \n(2) Payment Rate B reflects the \nprojected net costs of the Part D drugs dispensed to individuals who receive the LI NET benefit. \n(d) Payment reconciliation and risk \ncorridors\u2014(1) Reconciliation. CMS \nconducts LI NET payment reconciliation each year for Payment Rates A and B after the annual PDE data submission deadline has passed and makes the resulting payment adjustment consistent with \u00a7 423.343(a). \n(2) Risk corridors. As part of LI NET \npayment reconciliation, CMS will apply risk corridors to Payment Rate B as follows: \n(i) There will be no risk sharing in the \nsymmetrical 1% risk corridor around the target amount as defined in \u00a7 423.308. \n(ii) There will be symmetrical risk \nsharing of 0.1% beyond the 1% risk corridor. \n(iii) To carry out this section, \n\u00a7 423.336(c) applies to LI NET. \n(e) Reopening. The LI NET contract \nwill be subject to payment reopenings per \u00a7 423.346 as applicable. \n(f) Payment appeals. The LI NET \nsponsor can appeal under \u00a7 423.350. \n(g) Overpayments.
